*WARNING - EXPLICIT LANGUAGE*

Fans tore down barriers to gain entry to England's European Championship final clash with Italy.

Others scaled the perimeter fences at Wembley stadium to catch a glimpse of the big match. 

Thousands packed the road to the arena, but many had not bought tickets for the game.

Pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday, smashing windows and clashing with police as demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. in opposition to the certification by Congress of Joe Biden's presidential victory.

Debates over the certification of electoral votes of Arizona were taking place in both the House of Representatives and Senate when both were called into recess amid security concerns.

People could be seen on video storming through various hallways of the Capitol buildings, including both the House and Senate chambers, which appeared empty when people were seen inside. 

According to reports, a woman was also shot inside the building. It is not known what led to the shooting. Police later confirmed the woman had died.

Whether it was kissing each other at an Oscars afterparty in 2000, living under the same roof in the early 2010's, or seeming to be borderline estranged at the time of this video, you can always depend on this relationship being eventful and emotionally loaded. Having lost their mother, Marcheline Bertrand, to cancer, and endured a rollercoaster relationship with their father, Jon Voight, there sure are plenty of reasons for Haven and Jolie to lean on each other when the times get tough. But just how far they leaned remains a matter of speculation. Here's the truth about Angelina Jolie's relationship with her brother.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooyrmqanNrE,Why Hollywood Can't Stand Tom Cruise,"For a time, Tom Cruise was arguably the most recognizable and loved leading man in Hollywood. He starred in some of the most memorable movies of the '80s and '90s, including Risky Business, Top Gun, and the Mission: Impossible franchise. But over the years, Cruise’s star power and relationship with the public has taken a hit. He isn't the go-to leading man in Hollywood anymore but is now often the butt of jokes and viral video fails.

Is it all just jealousy or is the blame really on Cruise and his behavior? This is why Hollywood can't stand Tom Cruise anymore.

Shivamogga (Karnataka), Feb 22 (ANI): BJP leader Tejasvi Surya on February 22 reacted on the Bajrang Dal activist muder case and said that he has requested Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj S Bommai to establish an exclusive agency under State Intelligence Department. “I, along with BJYM workers, visited Harsha's parents. Growing Islamic fundamentalism in Karnataka has taken him a victim. This is Kerala model of terror that organisations like PFI, SDPI, CFI exported to Karnataka and other parts of the country,” said Tejasvi Surya. “I have requested Chief Minister and Shivamogga SP to not only register FIR under the Section of 302 IPC as murder but also register cases under UAPA and consider these as acts of terror. I request CM to establish an exclusive agency under State Intelligence Department manned with necessary resources,” added Surya. (SA)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbEodgY1gCs,China reopens wet markets in Wuhan as COVID-19 pandemic sweeps world,"As the world attempts to battle the worst pandemic it has faced in 100 years, the question many people are asking is: Where did COVID-19 come from? 

The truth is that there is no definitive answer, however many have pointed to a food market in Wuhan, China. Wet markets, as they are known, exist globally. These markets sell exotic and wild animals in open-air environments and are particularly popular in China, where the food is seen as cheaper, fresher and may contain special healing benefits. 

How does this relate to the deadly coronavirus COVID-19? 

Viruses that jump from animals to humans become far more dangerous because these diseases have not built up immunity in humans, and we have no vaccine or medication available to fight it. 

Viruses that jump from one animal to another animal and then to a human being even more deadly. 

This is what can happen in these wet markets, where animals are stored in close proximity, with little sanitation or health procedures. 

Ebola likely came from bats, swine flu from pigs, bird flu from birds and the SARS virus from 2003 also came from animals. And although we don’t know how many viruses came from wet markets, it is highly likely according to scientists that these markets have caused serious outbreaks in the past, and may have caused the most recent pandemic in December last year. 

Despite this, instead of closing down these wet markets after the SARS outbreak 20 years ago, or even after the COVID-19 epidemic currently engulfing the world, China has started to reopen its wet markets in Wuhan after lockdown, the ground zero of the virus.

Americans don't drive up the price by consuming more health care. They don't visit the doctor more than other developed countries:
http://international.commonwealthfund.org/stats/annual_physician_visits/

But the price we pay for that visit - for a procedure - it costs way more:
http://static1.squarespace.com/static/518a3cfee4b0a77d03a62c98/t/57d3ca9529687f1a257e9e26/1473497751062/2015+Comparative+Price+Report+09.09.16.pdf

The price you pay for the same procedure, at the same hospital, may vary enormously depending on what kind of health insurance you have in the US.

That's because of bargaining power. Government programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, can ask for a lower price from health service providers because they have the numbers: the hospital has to comply or else risk losing the business of millions of Americans.

There are dozens of private health insurance providers in the United States and they each need to bargain for prices with hospitals and doctors. The numbers of people private insurances represent are much less than the government programs. That means a higher price when you go to the doctor or fill a prescription.

Uninsured individuals have the least bargaining power. Without any insurance, you will pay the highest price.

#Coronavirus #COVID-19 #Virus

COVID-19 is the short name for the disease known as novel coronavirus disease 2019. Coronaviruses are a large group of similar viruses. Some are known to infect humans, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The one that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. All coronaviruses are named for the crown-like “spikes” that cover their surface, called spike, or “S,” proteins. Inside the virus, genetic material, called RNA, is made up of genes. Genes carry the information to make more copies of the virus. The virus can infect you if it enters your mouth, nose, or lungs. Inside your body, the S protein of the virus locks to a receptor on the surface of one of your cells. This can trigger the virus to enter the cell in a couple of ways. It may cause the virus to fuse with the cell surface, then release its genes into the cell. Or, the cell may pull the virus inside by enclosing it in a sac. Once inside, the virus can fuse to the sac and release its genes. Next, the genes use a structure in your cell, called a ribosome, to make new copies of the virus. The new viruses travel to the surface of the cell. There, they can leave to infect more cells. In the meantime, viral S proteins left on the surface of the infected cell can cause it to fuse with nearby healthy cells, forming a giant cell. This may be another way for the virus to spread between cells. People may be infected with COVID-19 for two to fourteen days before symptoms appear. The three main symptoms of COVID-19 are: a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include: tiredness, body aches, stuffy nose, sore throat, diarrhea and vomiting, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. Most people have a mild illness and can recover at home. Some people who have the virus may not get sick at all or may show no symptoms. But, if you have trouble breathing, or any other symptoms that are severe, call your doctor or the emergency room. They will tell you what to do. For most people who have the virus, the risk for serious illness is thought to be low. People sixty-five years and older may have a higher risk for serious illness. And, people of any age may be at high-risk if they have underlying conditions, such as: chronic lung disease or asthma; serious heart conditions; diabetes; severe obesity; chronic kidney disease, and liver disease. High-risk groups also include people with a weakened immune system, including: those on certain medications, such as corticosteroids;  people in cancer treatment; and those with HIV or AIDS.  Even if you aren’t in a high-risk group, it’s important to practice social distancing, which means keeping at least two meters, or six feet, between you and other people. This helps prevent infections and serious illness in others as well as yourself. For up-to-date information about COVID-19 and other ways to prevent its spread, visit the CDC website.

--

In 1968, Dr. Robert Ho Man Kwok felt ill after dinner at a Chinese restaurant and wrote a letter to a medical journal connecting his symptoms to MSG. His letter would change the world’s relationship with MSG, inspiring international panic, biased science, and sensationalist journalism for the next 40 years. So what is this seasoning, and is it actually bad for you? Sarah E. Tracy investigates.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIHZZMDp7uI,Why Christian Church Failed in India to Convert Hindus?,"India, Christian Church, Christianity, Bible, Conversion, Hindus, Sikhs

One of the basic concepts in Christianity is the Original Sin. Christians claim that Jesus died for the sins of others. But the entire Crucifixion story of Jesus Christ makes no sense at all. How can we inherit original sin from Adam? Why blame us for something we didn't do? That's not justice, and the Bible agrees: ''Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin'' (Deut. 24:16). So the story of Jesus Christ contradicts the Christian God itself!!!"

Miffed by the diplomats, Imran said that Pakistan is not West's 'slave' while addressing a rally in Pakistan's Punjab province. He hit out at them for pressurising them and not India. Imran has said that Pakistan had supported NATO in the Afghanistan war and suffered the loss. This comes after Pakistan's abstention on the UNGA resolution against Russia.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6VN_G9FsQ,This X Factor Judge Killed Her Career On Live TV,"Back in 2015, viewers of the New Zealand version of the singing competition ""The X Factor"" found themselves in utter disbelief when a contestant’s perfectly harmless performance was viciously attacked by two judges. Contestant Joe Irvine performed a big band arrangement of “Cry Me a River,” which offended married judges Natalia Kills (best known as Teddy Sinclair) and Willy Moon. Kills accused Irvine of stealing her husband’s look, and Moon compared Irvine to Norman Bates dressing up as his mother. Thankfully, the harsh ad hominem attacks quickly led to the judges being fired from the show. Let’s take a look at all the details of the judges on ""The X Factor"" who killed their careers on live TV.

CBS reporter Weijia Jiang asked Trump why he waited so long ‘to warn people the virus was spreading like wildfire’ in February ‘instead of holding rallies with thousands of people’? An irritated Trump touted his China travel ban as proof he acted fast. Jiang persisted with her point and said: ‘When you issued the ban, the virus was already here,’ to which Trump said: ‘Do your research.’

He was a judge on the popular reality cooking show for its first five seasons and helped make the show a success.

However, we all know now that the celebrity chef is no longer part of the show. Besides being a television personality, Bastianich is also a renowned restauranteur who owns restaurants in four countries.

Being a global restauranteur doesn’t give you much time for TV, but is that the reason why Joe Bastianich left MasterChef? A 2014 Facebook post gives the answer to that question.

Boris Johnson revealed the figure a day after pledging that boosters would be offered to all over-18s by 31 December.

Long queues formed at walk-in vaccination sites on Monday, with some people waiting five hours to get jabs.

The PM and the NHS are now appealing for volunteers to help get jabs into arms and run vaccination centres.

It comes as Boris Johnson is set to face his biggest backbench rebellion since the 2019 general election as MPs will vote on new Covid rules for England later.

FOX has ordered THE F WORD, a bold new food variety show from award-winning chef and series host Gordon Ramsay. Based on his hit U.K. series of the same name, each distinctive and fast-paced hour will combine good food and good cooking with Ramsay’s passion, energy and humor into a one-of-a-kind LIVE series. THE F WORD is scheduled to premiere in 2017 on FOX.
 
On THE F WORD, foodie families from across the U.S. will battle it out in an intense, high-stakes cook-off. In addition to impressing Ramsay, each team must win over the hearts and taste buds of the diners, celebrities and VIP guests whom they’re serving.
Throughout each hour-long episode, cooking competition meets variety show as Ramsay chats with surprise guests and VIPs in the dining room, hosts live remotes with people from across the country, and appears weekly in unique field segments with fans, foodies and culinary experts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSBFXuPylHg,"The Indian factory making 6,000 syringes a minute - BBC News","One of the world's biggest syringe makers has ramped up production because of the huge demand for Covid vaccines. 

Rajiv Nath, who heads India's largest syringe factory, says it is now making around 6,000 syringes a minute.

But he says that's still not enough given that the world needs 10 billion syringes to vaccinate just 60% of the population.

He believes co-ordination between the vaccine makers, governments, the World Health Organization and syringe makers will be “very, very critical” going forward.

As with any recipe, you can alter the salt content, or add fresh garlic to it. This is cabbage rolls MY WAY. YOU NEED:1 Organic cabbage (preferably Savoy)1 lb lean ground beef1 lb ground pork1 jar sauerkraut5-6 slices of black forest ham1/4 cup rice1 Litre Caesar Drink (Clamato)1 Small onion (chopped)PaprikaSalt1 or 2 bay leaves Cut out the hard part of the cabbage. I cut a ""square"" shape. Put the cabbage in a pot of hot water that is on low heat. While that is heating, prepare your meat mixture. MEATUse equal parts ground pork and ground beef. Add rice and salt. In a pan, saute the onions until they're translucent. Then add salt and Paprika. How much paprika? I'd say a few dashes. Then add the sauted onions to the meat mixture and mix ROLLTake the leaves out of the pot of water one at a time. Slice off the ""spine"" so it's easier to roll.Pack the meat into one end and roll it. Tuck in the ends  STACKStack the cabbage rolls ""snugly"" in the crock pot, directly on top of black forest ham. Add 1-2 bay leaves. Pour approx 1/3 jar of saerkraut on top. Pour your ceasar mix. It should cover the cabbage rolls. Cook for 4-6 hours as desired. Serve. I like to cool mine and eat them the next day. For some reason, these always taste better the following day once the flavours have marinated. Yep! You're welcome :)"

Business owner Jung Kim said that she was punched in the face by a customer who hurled racial insults at her as she was pummeled. “You little Asian girl,” said Sung Jun Lee, the woman’s son. “That’s what she remembered.” The attack left Kim bloodied and bruised with a broken nose. Kim said the break is so bad that she needs surgery. The trouble started after Kim said she asked Keaundra Young, Daquiesha Williams and three other women to leave her store after they knocked over several wig displays. “They started saying something like some racial words like, ‘Asian people shouldn’t be in the Black market,’” Lee said. “We’re stealing their money.” The video showed the women returning to the store, knocking over the displays again. Young eventually charged at Kim, punching her at least eight times. Lee said the women also scratched his face as he tried to fight them off his mother. Lee said the situation escalated when the pair nearly ran him and his father over with their vehicle in the parking lot. Williams has been charged with assault, while Young has been charged with aggravated assault."

On Thursday, September 23, the victim, Vladimir Zh. Told Lente.ru about this. According to a local publication, the incident took place on September 21. A Muslim woman wearing a hijab came to the reception. “I did not see anything strange in this, I have been working in the city for several years, the patients came in hijab earlier, the procedure is the same for everyone. For examination, I asked her to show her arms, legs, stomach - she had to bare literally 10 centimeters each, ”said Vladimir Zh. According to him, the patient was indignant, saying that she was not supposed to do this, but the doctor replied that the norms were the same for everyone. “Half an hour later, her husband burst into the office with the phrase“ do you like to look at women's tummies? ”He didn't say anything else but started beating me. In my practice, anything happened, they even came with a knife, but no one used it. But this time it didn't come to a conversation ”- summed up the victim."

Boris Johnson revealed the figure a day after pledging that boosters would be offered to all over-18s by 31 December.

Long queues formed at walk-in vaccination sites on Monday, with some people waiting five hours to get jabs.

The PM and the NHS are now appealing for volunteers to help get jabs into arms and run vaccination centres.

It comes as Boris Johnson is set to face his biggest backbench rebellion since the 2019 general election as MPs will vote on new Covid rules for England later.

Rajiv Nath, who heads India's largest syringe factory, says it is now making around 6,000 syringes a minute.

But he says that's still not enough given that the world needs 10 billion syringes to vaccinate just 60% of the population.

He believes co-ordination between the vaccine makers, governments, the World Health Organization and syringe makers will be “very, very critical” going forward.

In the Hindu scriptures, Shambala is said to be Kalki's birthplace, Shambala is a mythical paradise that is constantly talked about in the ancient Hindu scriptures, including the Kalachakra Tantra, and ancient writings such as the Zhang Zhung culture that spread Buddhism.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk,Proof of Interstellar Time Travel In Hinduism,"Interstellar Time travel is a mysterious subject in science and has been the subject of debate for centuries. But many believe it to be infeasible or fantasy, while others disagree. But is time travel really possible? Or is it just fantasy?
In the first part, we'll look at modern science, and In the second part, we'll look at Vedic scriptures.
Time Travel in Hinduism
When studying Hindu scriptures, there is evidence that suggests Interstellar time travel is possible. One such classic example is that King Kakudmi and his daughter Revati traveled to different dimensions and returned to Earth in the future."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P596EkLY_9U,When Did Exactly Mahabharata War Happen?,"According to the evidence from Geology, three different catastrophic events occurred, one near the Caribbean, one in Istanbul, and the last in Dwaraka. According to the survey, these catastrophic events occurred at the same time. The chronology of these exact dates establishes that all the Hindu kings who have ruled Hastinapur since Yudhishthir are the strongest evidence that anyone could understand. Therefore, it is shown that the Mahabharata war took place during 3139 BC. C. C., that is, 5,159 years ago."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYSroF1gZg,How These Three fundamental Qualities Govern The Universe?,"According to the Samkhya philosophy, the entire universe can be divided into two main categories: Prakriti and Purusha also known as Maya or illusion and True Reality respectively. Everything that is changeable, which is not infinite, is part of Maya  Purusha, on the other hand, is the only reality, the only immutable element in the universe: the Self, the soul. Everything within Prakriti, the illusory world, consists of three Gunas. Here Guna’s meaning is qualities. These three qualities are present in all objects to varying degrees, one quality is always more present or more dominant than the others. The three Gunas are Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. The three Gunas are present in everything; food, humans, animate and innate objects."

When one is at a particular intellectual level, only then can he or she start understanding the true message, which Allah Almighty conveyed through words of Quran. In this series we aim to do that.

FOX has ordered THE F WORD, a bold new food variety show from award-winning chef and series host Gordon Ramsay. Based on his hit U.K. series of the same name, each distinctive and fast-paced hour will combine good food and good cooking with Ramsay’s passion, energy and humor into a one-of-a-kind LIVE series. THE F WORD is scheduled to premiere in 2017 on FOX.
 
On THE F WORD, foodie families from across the U.S. will battle it out in an intense, high-stakes cook-off. In addition to impressing Ramsay, each team must win over the hearts and taste buds of the diners, celebrities and VIP guests whom they’re serving.
Throughout each hour-long episode, cooking competition meets variety show as Ramsay chats with surprise guests and VIPs in the dining room, hosts live remotes with people from across the country, and appears weekly in unique field segments with fans, foodies and culinary experts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk,The Chicken and the Egg: Mastering Japan’s Original Comfort Food,"Oyakodon, or chicken and eggs over rice, may be one of Japan’s simplest comfort foods, but done right, it can also be the most satisfying. Tokyo’s Tamahide restaurant has been setting the bar for oyakodon since 1891. Through eight generations of perfecting this gooey, savory dish, Tamahide keeps a strong tradition alive, and owner Konosuke Yamada intends to it pass on to his children. As customers willing to wait two hours for a bowl can tell you, here the chicken and the egg BOTH come first.

Apple cider vinegars is very popular in the world of cooking. It also a favorite in most of the recipes. But How can Apple Cider Vinegar Help You Lose Weight? In this video, we’re going to see: the benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar, and how to use it as a part of the daily diet to get the right results. 

For quite a long time, apple cider vinegar has been used by many people as an effective way of losing excessive weight. This weight loss method is also beneficial for circulatory health. Even children who are obese can use this supplement for excessive weight loss, as it has no side effects. Apple cider vinegar is made from fermentation of apple juice. 
The process of fermentation provides alcoholic apple cider, which is mixed with oxygen to generate acetic acid. The pH of apple cider is very useful for good health.

Apple cider weight loss has many advantages, such as its rich minerals, vitamins and other useful substances. It has almost all the vitamins that are required to maintain a good health, like vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin, A, vitamin P, vitamin B1, B2 and B6.

Drinking Apple cider vinegar can:

* Help control blood sugar.
* It suppresses your excessive appetite
* It helps you burn fat faster
* Help you feel full if you drink it before a meal, causing an appetite suppression affect.
* Vinegar has been shown to prevent fat from building.
* Vinegar has also been shown to affect insulin secretion.
* It helps regulate the pH of your skin and can help with acne and warts.  The pH affect is also, what helps your body to detox and maintain a healthy alkaline pH level

Here is how to Use Apple cider vinegar for Weight Loss

You don't need to drink very much to get its weight loss benefits. Just mix 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar to a cup of water and drink the mixture between one and three times a day, ideally before a meal. Some also suggest drinking it first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach after waking up and then an hour before each meal.

Apple cider vinegar is very acidic, so you need to dilute it to protect your teeth, throat and the lining of your stomach. Don’t drink undiluted ACV.
Apple cider vinegar will not provide you with a quick weight loss. The changes will be gradual, but permanent. Don’t be impatient and allow it some time. Sometimes losing just one pound a month and not re-gaining it afterwards, can be the real success.

How fast you will lose weight, depends on other factors as well, things like your exercise, nutrition, stress and genetic factors. For best and fastest results, you need to combine this natural product with other techniques for losing weight, so the function of vinegar gets supported with lifestyle changes."

We have over 600 muscles in our bodies that help bind us together, hold us up, and help us move. Your muscles also need your constant attention, because the way you treat them on a daily basis determines whether they will wither or grow. Jeffrey Siegel illustrates how a good mix of sleep, nutrition and exercise keep your muscles as big and strong as possible.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YImqb-g0pfo,The BEST Way to Stretch Before a Workout (Don't Make This Common Mistake Again),"**Stretching can either HURT you or HELP you. Don't ruin your workout by warming-up the WRONG way**

CLICK here to Learn Why Stretching WON""T Make You Flexible:
http://www.criticalbench.com/stretching

===

You may be among the vast majority of the population who is misinformed about warming up and stretching before a workout. Whether you mistakenly assumed or were instructed to stretch out as a precursor to your workout, you may have been putting your muscles at greater risk.

Many individuals think that they are moving or using their muscles during the workout so they need to stretch them before moving; however, research indicates that warming up is a necessary first step to protect the muscles and body.

Take a look at these research studies showing the importance of a correct warm-up and it's effects on a workout:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167945716302986
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3849057
http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/14/935
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22067244
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15377965

The importance of warm up exercises can be compared to driving your car in freezing cold weather. It is generally best to allow your car to warm up a bit before revving it up to high speeds. The same principle applies when you work out. You want to physically prepare your body for the demands of a strenuous workout by gradually increasing your body temperature.

Rolland used this idea of architectural design and sculptural for her collection using fabrics like chiffon, organza, and even ostrich feathers to bridge the line between architecture and elegance. Those fabrics appeared soft while pencil skirts and waists cinched with gold circular belts were more structured.  Color combinations that typically clashed suddenly looked like they belonged together and unique tulip shapes in the waist and box shapes in the sleeves provided something architectural and different.  The beauty of it was that when models moved, a 3D effect was created in the clothes. 

By the way, Yasmin Le Bon ended the spectacular Rolland runway wearing a 110 pound silk jersey red dress with metal plates and a 147.5 foot train. She had to have two men walk with her to hold it up.

It's lots of fun and a great tool for self reflection in many ways.  You don't need to marry each man you go on a date with, and you certainly don't need to sleep with him either.

I have learned all about creating boundaries for myself, asking for what I want and communication that has improved my life in more ways than one... smash. that. button if you want this to become a series!

Thumbs up if you would like me to go into more detail on what to do on the first actual date and tips that can make you instantly more attractive!
