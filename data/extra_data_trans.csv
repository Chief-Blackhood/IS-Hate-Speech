https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0MjY_tpG-I,NZ Māori Party calls for a ‘divorce’ from the British Monarchy,"Sky News host Peta Credlin says the New Zealand Māori Party are calling for a “divorce” from the British Monarchy. 
  
Ms Peta Credlin spoke with The Australian’s Jennifer Oriel about the proposal. 
  
“A lot of liberal democracies have come from a Christian base and the British Empire; that’s the reality,” Ms Oriel said. 
  
“If you want a free country, you’d best be sticking with the queen.""","It was yesterday we were celebrating the record breaking Rain Queen. But interestingly, over 9 New Zealand, the Maori Party has other ideas. They've called for a divorce from the British monarchy. Jennifer do you think this is a a serious move now? Adam New Zealand. Well, they cancelled everything haven't and now they're cancelling the queen so happy birthday mum, but I think that the the problem here is the same as as most of the issues in the Council culture campaign. We see that there's a lot of destruction in cancel culture pulling down statues, vandalism, sometimes attacking people who have different beliefs to to the people in in the politically correct left. And the problem with that is there's nothing put in its place. So they they the best piece, sort of spending more time on constructive work. What kind of society do they want to live in? What kind of world do they want to live in? What kind of country will replace the one that has been, you know, has the Queen as head of state, what kind of world do they want to live in? These are the questions that they need to be answering, and if you're not answering those questions, you're not considering the reality. Which is, they have choices. There can be ruled. There are three kinds of regimes in the world at the moment there's a communist regime under, you know. Very militant China. There are Islamist regimes and you can have that kind of world to live under. Or you can choose liberal democracy and a lot of liberal democracies have come from a Christian base and the British Empire. That's the reality. So if you want a free country, you'd best be sticking with the queen. All going, the American. Interestingly John, but that's a Republic."

Air Force drops a massive hint,"Pakistan should start counting its days, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has put his foot on the gas pedal to take back the illegally occupied areas of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Watch the video, to know more.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has finally put his foot on the gas to reclaim the illegally occupied regions of the Pakistan occupied Kashmir or as many know it as be OK, Air Marshall. Amit Dave said that India will soon be coming for POK. He also said that someday India will govern the entire region. Now they should send chills down Pakistan spine because PM Modi is planning a big surprise for India's terror. Sponsoring neighbor. Hi and welcome. This is English the national socio political analysis arm of the TF. I'm sad heart your host, and in this video I will tell you about India's plans in regaining the Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Let's begin Pakistan should start counting his days as Prime Minister. Narendra Modi has put his foot on the gas pedal to take back the illegally occupied areas of Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Reportedly, Air Marshall, Macdev Air Officer, commanding in chief of Western Air Command speaking at the 75th anniversary of Indian troops, began landing, remarked that India will soon be coming for POK. And that someday it will govern the entirety of the region. The high ranking official said all the activities which were carried out by the Indian Air Force and the Army on October 27th of 1947 resulted in ensuring the freedom of this part of Kashmir. I'm sure that someday the Pakistan Occupied Kashmir will also join this part of Kashmir and we will have the whole of Kashmir in years to come. Air Marshall, Amit Dave also added that people in POK were being treated unfairly and that the two parts of Kashmir will soon be joined. Entire Kashmir is 1. The nation is one people on both sides have common attachments today or tomorrow. History will witness that nations come together. We do not have a plan at the moment, but God willing it will always be there because people in Pakistan occupied Kashmir are not being treated very fairly by the Pakistanis. Interestingly, the statements by the Indian Air Force and its top ranking official come at a time when Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited the Kashmir Valley for the very first time since the abrogation. Of Article 370, it is pertinent to note that it is Narendra Modi government's outreach program under which Union ministers are traveling to the region and Amit Shah's visit also comes under the same program. The Indian forces are known for their water tight discipline and unlike the army in our neighborhood, it does not release immature statements to please the masses. Pakistan Army and his top generals routinely sell the false utopia to citizens that they will soon capture Kashmir and in turn India. However the Indian forces always remain tight lipped about their future courses of action. Thus, air Marshall amid dev speaking confidently and with some assuredness about the forces coming for POK, is a surprise and a good one at that too. It also means that the winds of change have started to blow in the Prime Minister's office, and that the government is getting ready for perhaps its biggest rendezvous. As reported by TFI in 2019, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had asserted in the lower House of Parliament after the abrogation of Article 370 that and oxygen are part of Jammu and Kashmir. He thumpingly said we are ready to give our lives for it. Amit Shah had added when I say Jammu and Kashmir. It includes me OK both Indian and J&K constitutions also say that the state is an integral part of India and this gives us the right to form laws for the state which includes POK. And excited now not many know about this, but 24 seats in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly are left vacant for the people of POK shall later reiterated his statement at a news channel event that POK is an integral part of India and the decision regarding his official inclusion as a part of the Union of India will be taken at the right time in the future. A resolution unanimously adopted by the Parliament on February 22 of 1994 affirmed that the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been is and shall be an integral part of India and demanded that Pakistan must vacate the areas of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir which they have occupied through aggression. Contrary to popular belief, is a rather small strip of land where the majority of Kashmiris are located. Gilgit Baltistan, oxide chin and the part ceded by Pakistan to China. Are there other regions that make up the entire state of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir following the signing of the Instrument of Accession with India? But the then ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh, Indian troops landed in the valley on October 27th of 1947. The very next day after Pakistani tribals carried out raids and seized access to the region. As for Gilgit Baltistan, the region landed in Pakistan. Slap courtesy of the betrayal of the British military officer of the Maharaja, while Maharaja was signing the Instrument of Accession. Major Brown sworn to protect the region, revolted and captured kings governor Brigadier guns Arrising. Major Brown then informed his British boss, stationed at Peshawar about his decision to exceed to Pakistan. He defected on N1 and the Pakistani forces occupied Gilgit Baltistan on November. 4. Since then, Gilgit Baltistan has been under Pakistan administrative control, and it's a shame. However, with Air Marshall, Amit Dave reiterating that India wants to govern the entire of Kashmir, it means that other than POK, the forces could be planning to take back Gilgit Baltistan as well. And if the operation is successful, they might also come for oxygen, which was gifted to China by certain Congress statesman. It was for precisely this reason that last year IMD had made a significant move. By adding and Gilgit Baltistan in his weather forecast, I MD has started referring it's metrological subdivision of Jammu and Kashmir as Jammu and Kashmir. Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad, now Muzaffarabad is part of the illegal. While Gilgit Baltistan is also under illegal Pakistani occupation. Moreover, as argued by TFI, ever since Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, Pakistan has got the nod to shift his terrorist launchpads near the Indian border in POK and Gilchrist. And it wants to ramp up its terrorist activities, sensing that the nuisance by Pakistani terror office could pose problems to India's internal security, the government is planning to stay ahead. Of the curve. For taking back the illegally occupied territory of India already has a tried and tested playbook, that of the Indo Pakistani War of 1971. India had assisted East Pakistan in its liberation war from West Pakistan making a new territory of Bangladesh. One of the shortest wars in history, lasting just 13 days. The hostility had ended with the eastern command of the Pakistani military signing the instrument of surrender. India had showcased an excellent harmonious relation of. Office statesmanship and vigilant armed forces and the same needs to be replicated. Once again the Modi government has set the ball rolling and given the astonishing track record this government health in achieving the unthinkable. This proposition seems like a challenge that the dynamic duo of Modi and Amit Shah will be hell bent to overcome."

http://rajshrifood.com/","Hi guys, welcome to Rajshri Food. This is the Bombay chef Varnum and today I bring Mexico into your kitchen. Mexico in the form of bean enchiladas. You cannot trust me. It's a very simple recipe. I'm just breaking it into different components. So the first thing that goes in is some olive oil, so I put in some olive oil. I'm adding in some garlic. Finely crushed garlic. The next thing that goes in is some onion. I'm taking whites of the spring onion. Give it a light stuff. Next goes in some Capsicum. Again, give it a light stuff. Once these onions start sweating, I'm adding in the boiled beans. Now these beans have been boiled with a little bit of salt and water, and I've made sure that the beans have become absolutely fork tender, and that's the way these beans would taste even better. Bagels in the beans, giving it a stir. I'm adding in some salt. Remember, salt is also been added in while boiling, so make sure salt is absolutely in check. Next goes in some sweet paprika and I'm adding in some cumin powder. Give it that stuff. And with the back of the spoon, I'm just mashing half the pain. Well, to adjust the consistency you can also use a potato masher, or you can run half the mixture in a grinder. Now that the entire mixture has come together, half of it has been matched. Half of it has been kept just the way it is, so there you go. The stuffing is ready. We keep this aside and we start making the sauce. Now let's begin with the ranchero sauce, which is actually a tomato based Mexican gravy, a little spicy, a little tangie, a little sweet. But the flavors can be adjusted. So the first thing is I'm going to smoke in some olive oil, and then I'm going to chart the red Peppers. Now that the capsicum is nice and charred, I'm adding in crushed garlic. Next goes in the whites of an onion. A light stuff. And next goes in. Some tomatoes which have been roughly cut along with this, I'm adding in a tablespoon of flour. Next goes in some malt vinegar. Sugar. But then some salt, some cayenne pepper. Parsley. Basil and giving it a light stuff. I'm adding in a little bit of water so that this becomes like a nice tomato Stew, which can later be pureed into a ranchero sauce. Now that the tomatoes have become nice and soft, I'm just going to blend this into a chunky mixture, so I'm just putting the flame off. Now that this is converted into a chunky sauce, I just put the flame on for another two minutes and add in my magic spice, which is Habanero Habanero is going to give the sauce a unique kick, and this is something that is actually imperative to a good ranchero sauce. So now that we have the components ready, let's start making the bean enchiladas. The first thing that we're going to do is take a baked pan. And I'm adding in a little bit of the ranchero sauce right at the bottom, so there it goes. And just making sure it's evenly laid right in the entire band. So once this is done. Now let's start making the enchiladas, so I'm going to take a tortilla disc and I'm going to add in the bean mixture, so before that I'm just going to add in some fresh onion greens. Start this nicely. Now with a spoon, I'm going to add in a few scoops of this mixture right in the center of the tortilla disk. Something like this? Then I'm going to roll it up into a nice little roll. So I'm just going to make a few more like this. Now that these rolls are ready, I'm just going to cut these as per the size of my baking dish or the casserole. So for now I'm cutting these in half and I'm placing this in the baking dish with the seam side down. This goes in. Now that I have set these rolls on the ranchero sauce and now topping it again with some ranchero. I'm adding in a cheese slice to just have a little tighter control on the cheese quantity, so there goes in the cheese. And another slice. Now this goes in the oven at 180 degrees for 10 minutes. Bean enchiladas are ready, the sauce is bubbling. The cheese is just slightly melting. Let's now play this. I'm just scooping in two of these. Fresh parsley springs. And a dash of extra virgin olive oil. Now that the bean enchiladas are ready, do try it at home and do not forget to catch me. 2nd of March onwards on get carried."

Virginia Kruta from The Daily Wire reports, CNN medical expert Dr. Leana Wen said that it might be time to lift mask mandates — not because they don’t work or because the threat has passed, but in order to “preserve public health authority for when it’s needed again.”

#NextNews","We're witnessing a major narrative shift when it comes to COVID and mitigation efforts. Bill Maher's real time recently couple monologues went right after the Liberal establishment and a lot of the rules they've handed down since the beginning. And now we're seeing states Democrat states lifting mandates, despite the fact that Pritzker here in Illinois is clinging out of his mask for dear life. And then we've got CNN. This is really interesting. Their medical expert is now giving a horrifying reason why they believe that mass mandates should end. This is CNN, mind you? OK, so let's get some context here to what is happening before we do. If you're new here, hit the red button down below to subscribe, then tap that notification bell so the first to know when we published new reports. Now, let's analyze what's happening. CNN medical expert recently stated that the masked mandate should end. That normally would be news to celebrate, however, the reason given should actually scare every American Virginia kruta at daily wire reports, CNN medical expert Doctor Leana Wen, who was also. Ahead of Planned Parenthood. Before she went on to be a CNN commentator, she said that it might be time to lift mass mandates because. Well, how are we even allowed to say this? I mean I don't know well she had a reason. Maybe she'll say it in the clip here. Because the threat has passed, but in order to preserve public health, authority to preserve public health, health, authority for when it's needed. Again because people are losing faith. She explained she wasn't saying the idea was good for people to not to stop wearing masks, but that governments needed to ease up and allow people to make decisions for themselves, arguing that people were more likely to accept later restrictions coming from public health authorities if they were first giving back some of their liberty. An autonomy watch start up. You say we can start removing at least some coronavirus restrictions. Now tell us why. Well, I agree with the Colorado with many other local and state jurisdictions that are beginning to lift government mandates, and I think this is the key. I'm not saying that we should be stopping masking, but rather that this needs to shift from a government requirement to an individual decision. The government can't keep on telling our citizens that this is a 5 alarm fire all the time. People are just going to start tuning it out and not pay attention. They'll be desensitized and So what needs to happen is we need to end the state of emergency. And preserve the ability of public health authorities to reinstitute mandates in the future. If we see more and more dangerous variants later. Yeah, I mean she, she's more worried about the authority that they're going to lose in the future because people are not going to listen to them. They're going to tune them out. So let's. Make it about individual decisions. Individual choice before people lose absolute faith and stop listening altogether. I should point out this meme here. I found grand old memes. People are going to be are going to be free to choose to make their own decisions about themselves. That's not a santis, and then the responsibility should shift from a government managed to an individual responsibility CNN. In that interesting well, singing from the same song sheet now. They write that a number of officials have rolled back mass mandates in their states, most notably newly elected Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, Democratic Governor Phil Murphy and John Carney have all announced a plan to remove school masking requirements in a matter of weeks, prompting a response from White House Press Secretary Jin Sakai at Monday's briefing this week. Saki, the chief propagandist at the White House, said that it still recommended that children wear masks in school because that was the most recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But she noted individual schools and localities were at liberty to adopt different policies watch. Check on the mask mandate question in New Jersey in the States and the CDC is still recommending universal masking in schools. That's correct, and that's still remains our recommendation. So are you pleased with the fine with the New Jersey governor's decision? Again, our advice to every school district is to abide by public health guidelines. It continues to be at this point that the CDC is advising that masks can delay reduce transmission. There are also a number of other mitigation measures that we've put in place, but that continues to be. CDC guidance. It's always been up to local school districts to determine how they implement. What does it say then that a governor like Phil Murphy, who's been so closely aligned with the policies of this administration, would get ahead of the medical experts and say, never mind what they say? School districts, you decide. Well, it's always been up to school districts. That's always been our point of view and always been our policy from here and our policy from the federal government is to continue to advise everybody to abide by public health guidelines. Do you think they signaled that? Perhaps the public believes it's time for a change in the federal guidelines? CBC's guide well we certainly understand and have seen in polling that the public is tired of COVID. We understand that. So are we. And there has been some good signs recently where there has been a decrease in hospitalizations around the country. And again we're in constant touch about what it looks like moving forward. But our responsibility as the federal government is to rely on the data and the science that is being analyzed by our public health experts and will continue to rely on that. For what recommendations we're making? So listen to what's being said. Let's give people back a little bit of freedom now so we can ensure the government can oppress all of us later. OK, that mindset should scare all of us. This was the left plan all along. They're openly acknowledging the things they would never say out loud. This is some serious Orwellian stuff. So we think the left is planning next. How afraid should we be? Comment below, we'll see you at the next report for the next news network. I'm Gary Franchi. Thank you for watching that report.

Although they are a religious minority, they are in harmony with Muslims. Sometimes Hindus are the victim of negative politics as well and those victims at times migrate to India. So how are the millions of Hindus in Bangladesh faring today? Our correspondent Lakena Jasmine Soma reports from Bangladesh. Take a look. There are 17 million Hindus living in Bangladesh with a population of about 116 million in general. There is a very cordial relationship between the majority Muslims and the Hindu minority. The position of Hindus in the politics of Bangladesh, in the cabinet or at the higher level of the secretariat is significant, especially after the Awami League LED government came to power in 2008. Various initiatives have been taken to empower the Hindu community in the last one decade. Even a Chief Justice was appointed in this country from the Hindu community. Bangladesh started its journey in 1971 with the dream of building a non communal and secular state. Today, despite all the problems, people of all religions and ethnic groups are celebrating their festivals peacefully. The people of Bangladesh want to move forward by continuing this trend in the years to come. Leon travels to Doc Ishwari Mandir, which has the distinction of being Bangladesh National Temple, a hub of social, cultural as well as religious fervor of the Hindu community. To get a first hand account of people's aspirations. Some country to live in and I don't think there is any kind of communal kind of things in anybody's mind. It was comparatively what I would say harmonious, and I've grown up with a lot of Muslim people around me and it was good when we've never had conflicts regarding religion. Any friends have a Muslim, but they are behavior, not many problematic, so I'm I'm I'm. We are very friendly. Communicate each other. The hopes of Hindu community in Bangladesh have risen under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been a vocal advocate of equal rights for minorities. She also scrapped a controversial law to dispel complexities over ownership of properties by the members of the minority community. There is always ups and downs in one line. I will say this present government. This Pro liberation government. They are more comparatively more minority friendly that is, quote UN quote is the main thing, so that is the main stigma. This is the positive. Contrary to this reality of Hindu Muslim harmony in Bangladesh. There is also a negative image. The Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Maha Jot says that in the first six months of 2020, 592 minorities were tortured in the country. It damages one or more individuals, families, institutions and temples, especially when the national parliament election comes, Hindus become victims of political violence. Various statistics show that the trend of being tortured in Bangladesh and consequently moving to India has never stopped. According to the 2011 census, the number of Hindus in 15 districts of Bangladesh has decreased by almost a million in 10 years. Bureau report we on world is 1. Leon is now available in your country.

x","Coming up I'm gonna turbocharge veg in a game changing cottage pie I want a nice large casserole pan on a medium heat so add yourself a couple of tablespoons of nice olive oil and then some Rosemary. 3 Spriggs is all you want. Now we're going to do two things. The first thing is we're going to flavor that oil. Secondly, we're going to make these soft woody herbs crispy and snappy, and we'll sprinkle them over the finished cottage pie and it will blow your mind. After just one minute, remove the Rosemary. Now we can ramp up the root veg by coating them in that lovely flavored oil. Starting with three hacked up carrots and half a Swede, Swede has an amazing sweet, delicious flavor. It adds so much to a nice cottage pie and then half as alarik. Now the celeriac has deep, hearty flavors, especially if you roast it or cook it in this way in flavored oil. It's got a kind of. Celery flavor, it's a bit mushroomy and so many people have never ever tried it. Last veggie two beautiful washed leeks and you get some amazing sweetness from this. What's really brilliant is each one of these veggies tastes very different? And as we cook them, they just get more intense and more delicious. But in the wonderful world of making veggies taste incredible, there's a few little tricks and one of them is Cuming. Just a little pinch of cumin seeds. Give us savouriness and meatiness a depth of flavor that's phenomenal. And here's the thing right when you're clever about how you cook these veggies, just like you would meet, right? When you respect it, you can get comforting big, deep sort of sumptuous flavors that you're gonna love. Ask that cooks for 30 minutes kick off your mash by boiling 1.2 kilos of potatoes in salted water. Now I want to show you an epic gravy to this cottage pie pop. 10 grams of dried porcini mushrooms in a blender with 600 milliliters of boiling water and leave to infuse. Of course, when you dry things like mushrooms, the depth of flavor that you're going to get is amazing. Then add 1 red Onion plus a teaspoon of Marmite or Vegemite. A great cheat to get savory seasoning. That little bit will make all the difference and then 3 tablespoons of tomato puree. Give it away. But the best bit of this gravy is already in the pan. We've got sticky bits galore on the bottom, that's caramelization. And the minute this hits the pan. It will start deglazing the stickybits. That's gonna really give it flavor and making credible gravy. Now. My final ingredient with tin of lentils and the brilliant thing about lentils is they will cook away to nothing. They'll thicken it slightly to make it wonderfully meaty. Loosen with water and let it cook down for 20 minutes. Then mash the spuds with butter, seasoning and milk before topping your cottage pie. So just use a fork to let it rain random chunks of spuds. You wait, this is going to be good whack in the oven for 30 minutes at 190 degrees Celsius or 375 degrees Fahrenheit and that mega gravy will turn this meat free cottage pie into a deep, hearty dinner. Look at that that my friends. Is a beautiful thing and don't forget we had these little crispy bits of Rosemary. Proper delicious food. Absolutely blooming. Or just come on. And really nice serve with some greens, right? Let's have a go. So. That is extraordinary delicious. Wow, no compromise there by giving the same respect to the veggies as you would have cut of meat, it's giving us the most beautiful flavor and absolute classic. What a brilliant way to celebrate vegetables."

#NextNews","Some things are just too much for the Liberals. At MSNBC, wait till you see this. They have a cow. They freak out when they see what Canadian truckers are armed with. Yes, plinko tables, pizza ovens, hot tubs and bounce houses. Before I get into details. If you're new here, hit the red button down below to subscribe, then tap that notification bell so you're the first to know the next time MSNBC staffers hyperventilate. It's always interesting seeing how the mainstream media in the US covers liberal protesters compared to conservative ones. Here's a hint. They don't treat them the same at all. Liberal protests are given carte blanche to do whatever they want, including burn down cities, kill people, looting right while conservative protests are generally called insurrectionist racists, or worse. Brianna Lyman from the Daily Caller has more reports that MSNBC host Katy Tur and parliamentary reporter Ann Bergeron appeared to be concerned that Canadian Truckers has gone so far as to set up pizza ovens in hot tubs as they protest in Ottawa over the restrictions there quote we have heard called a nationwide insurrection. That's what Ur noted that Ottawa officials have warned about the siege in the insurrection. Quote, it sounds like you're talking about close streets in the center of town. There it sounds like it's causing quite a bit of havoc, not just in the city but across the country. Watch the moment we just heard a city official a moment ago, say that that he needed help a police officer. He needed help. I believe it was a. It was more than a police officer. May be a chief and we've heard it called a nationwide insurrection. It sounds like you know you're talking about the closed streets in the center of town. There it sounds like it's causing quite a bit of havoc, not just in that city, but across the country. Yeah, so the clip was just from our police chief here in Ottawa, Peter slowly and he said that the Ottawa police is overwhelmed, that they do not have the resources able to deal with what he is calling a siege in an occupation. And you know, this is not just a protest. Ottawa, like any capital city, is used to a protest. But here you know, right beside me, they set up a plinko table. One of those games you would see on the price is right. They have open fire pits that are burning throughout the downtown. They have villages. Essentially. They build structures on the street to to keep people warm. They have a full set of. I saw some pizza ovens the other day, even in one spot. Organizers had three different saunas and a hot tub set up, and so the big question has been, why isn't Ottawa police enforcing this stronger? They say they just don't have the resources that this situation is too volatile. They have started to get a little bit stronger, but most people are saying this is taken way too long and we are now at a point where all of these trucks have lots of fuel and it's getting too dangerous to do much of anything. It's incredible to hear that they they have saunas setup or pizza oven set up. Just one one more question very quickly. 33 hot dog hot tubs and pizza ovens and. I mean that is the sign of an insurrection. If I've ever seen one, I mean, could you imagine? I mean people cooking food or maybe sitting in a sauna. Wow, that's one heck of a protest. Dangerous, dangerous time we live in now in Canada, right? Give me a break. Now. They stay here. The truckers have been ticketed for honking in the protests as well. Yeah, deadly honking. Several people were arrested over the weekend delivering gas to the truckers. Yes, smuggling gas, apparently, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson declared a state of emergency on Sunday claiming that the protests reflect a serious danger and threat to the safety and security of residents posed by the ongoing demonstrations and highlights the need for support from other jurisdictions and levels of government. While to describe unlawful behavior amongst truckers as excessive noise, use of fireworks, driving through a no truck route, failure to drive in a marked lane, and failure to produce documents according to KTVI. Well dangerous so dangerous. At least you're not burning down the city killing people and looting every single store for city blocks, right? At least maybe the Walmart and Best Buy are still standing. Give me a break. They're probably going shopping there so they can get supplies for their pizza oven. Now the media can't stand that there's actually a peaceful conservative protest. I mean, just look at how they cover the right to life protests. They happen every year in DC. They don't cover it. Now they're trying to malign these peaceful protesters for no reason. So do you support these truckers? Let's see some hands down in the comments. We'll see you in the next report for the next news network. I'm Gary Franchi. Thank you for watching that report. Yes, key to the keto diet. It's been a hot topic in the weight loss community for years. Now, myself and thousands of others have personally experienced weight loss and the health benefits of the keto diet. But there is a little secret we aren't really on the keto diet. We use an amazing new powder. It's called keto powder keto with Gary is a. Powdered form of the most ketogenic mccoil called C. Eight. It helps give you the many benefits of elevated ketones without having to completely follow the rigid guidelines of the keto diet within weeks of taking it, it control my appetite.

#N3","Chief propagandists at the White House, Baghdad. Bob Saki says that Biden still wants 2 year olds to be forced to wear something on their face in school, despite the multiple States and nations who are pushing back and opening wide again. Before I get into this report, if you're new to the next news network, I'm going to welcome you and invite you to subscribe by tapping the red button down below. I don't want you to miss an important report. John Saki is the queen of dodging questions. I don't think she's ever met a question that she doesn't think she can't dodge or circle back to. And she's not very good at it, though she usually stutters or something when trying to talk about it. This time she gave a clear answer, but it wasn't a very good one. Let's go on and see what exactly she was talking about. Christina. Leila has more at the Gateway Pundit reports that White House press Secretary Jen Saki went on the record and confirmed Joe Biden supports schools that abuse toddlers, Delaware and New Jersey are the latest Democrat run states to lift all school mask mandates. The snakes in the liberal press pool are. Angry that governors are ignoring CDC mask guidelines that recommend schools Force 2 year olds to wear masks when asked about New Jersey's decision to lift the school of Mask mandate, Jen Psaki said. It remains Biden's recommendation recommendation that schools forced 2 year olds to wear masks wash. Going back on the mask mandate question in New Jersey and other states, the CDC is still recommending universal masking in schools. That's correct, and that still remains our recommendation. So are you pleased with the fine with the New Jersey governor's decision? Again, our advice to every school district is to abide by public health guidelines. It continues to be at this point that the CDC is advising that masks can delay reduce transmission. There are also a number of other mitigation measures that we've put in place, but that continues to be CDC guidance. It's always been up to local school districts to determine how they implement. What does it say then that a governor like Bill Murphy, who's been so closely aligned with the policies of this administration, would get ahead of the medical experts and say, never mind what they say? School districts, you decide. Well, it's always been up to school districts. That's always been our point of view and always been our policy from here and our policy from the federal government is to continue to advise everybody to abide by public health guidelines. Do you think it's a signal that perhaps the public believes it's time for a change in the federal guidelines? The CDC's guide. Well, we certainly understand and have seen in polling that the public is tired of COVID. We understand that. So are we. And there has been some good signs recently where there has been a decrease in hospitalizations around the country. And again, we're in constant touch about what it looks like moving forward. But our responsibility as the federal government is to rely on the data on the science that is being analyzed by our public health experts and will continue to rely on that. For what recommendations we're making? Unless they move the goal posts again. The Democrat Party are now on record supporting masking children and toddlers. Now this photo of Democrat Georgia, Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. Is basically the Democrat Party in a nutshell. There you go. Yes, our kids are being forced to live through mandates that are hurting their ability to learn. They're being left behind and it's horrible. This will be remembered as a lost generation in education and the Democrat powers in our government only do the bidding of the unions. Do you think our children should have to follow Bidens mandates? Let me know in the comments below. We'll see you at the next report for the next news network. I'm Gary Franchi. Thank you for watching that report. Yes, we're only just discovering the anti-aging power of collagen myself and thousands of others. For example, have already experienced these powers first hand. But there is a secret I don't take.

Take away a very straightforward, easy Malaysian Curry. We're going to make a Curry paste. The most exciting thing about this space is that you can make it the start of the week. Use a bit of it and just keep it in the fridge. It's there ready like butter. OK, Dave, I want you to feel the ginger Gordon. I want to cut the Chili's in half. Charlie, lemongrass and shallots. What we do with these ingredients. Not going to chop them all. We're just going to blend them into a paste, **** everything in a blender, add turmeric and blitz. Then add a drizzle of ground oil and blitz again. And that should paycheck little smile that in there. Oh well, get it all nice and hot yeah and watch a little bit in there and start cooking that out. OK, now once we start cooking off this paste then we slice the onions, put the onions in OK. Look at the color of that. Now no, that's the little magic ingredient in there. So this is what it should be like. At weekend you guys cook. You know that? Yeah, how's it feel to be cooking? I'm actually really enjoying it. Really superb. How are they doing those onions? Sweating down nicely. Sweat down nicely. Yeah, see the way it's all starting to breakdown. Yep, that's ready now for the chicken, so don't worry about burning your little fingers on there like that. Look down and start sweating the chicken down so you just have to keep them on the Boulevard rather than the reason I keep on the bone. Is that just cooking? I don't want chicken drying out coconut milk in please? OK, thank you. Then add a tin of coconut milk followed by some stock. Spices and soy sauce. Now, one thing I haven't seen in here is anything sort of slightly healthy, so the car is going to be finished with some green beans. Alright, OK, we're gonna finish it with green beans, but hey, you can finish it with spinach. You can put broccoli in there, put cauliflower in there, but potatoes in there at the end. But you've got to start eating a little bit. ******* healthier. How could you compare that in your fridge? Standing next to that ******* roll of furry sticky, stinky ******* ham. I'm embarrassed about that. I would be ******* embarrassed. I was embarrassed at the beginning about that. This has made me even more embarrassed. Justin. How's it going? There we go? Oh awesome, that sounds amazing, yeah? So it's not on #59 I can tell I'm living with that we'll go for a beer. Good. To help you. Delicious for me. The most important message if you guys keep it up. No, no, not at all. I'm not gonna have a ******* pot belly bigger than my ******* pig. Nice to see you around the table. Yeah guys speaking with favor and stay around the table. Yeah, let's stay off the ******* telephone ordering **** yeah yeah. Seriously guys, let's do this more often. Who needs take away when you got that? Beautiful."

Natasha's Kitchen
PO Box 161
Meridian, ID 83680
USA","Hi everyone, it's Natasha of natashaskitchen.com and today I am sharing our secrets for the best homemade cheeseburgers. We partnered with beef, it's what's for dinner on behalf of the beef checkoff, to show you how to make the ultimate juicy burger. Before we get started, I want to share a great beef resource with you. So say you have some ground beef in the refrigerator and you don't know what to make for dinner. Well, beef, it's what's for dinner came up with a new tool called Chuck knows beef. It can be accessed through Chuck knows beef.com through your Google Home or Amazon Echo Alexa ask Chuck knows beef for ground beef recipes. Here are some recipes to tempt your taste buds. One beef spaghetti pilot 2. Greek style beef and cheese ravioli 3 beef and vegetable fried rice Chuck knows beef is a smart resource on all things beef. But before we get to the beef it's important with burgers to have all your toppings and sauces and buns ready so that when those burgers come off, the grilled juicy and so delicious everything is ready and you can enjoy them hot. So we're going to do the toppings right now. You'll need half a head of green leaf lettuce and cut that into pieces that will fit the bun. Now cut one large tomato into eight thin slices. You'll need about two slices per burger. Thinly slice half of a red onion and we love red onions for burgers because they are more mild in flavor and not overpowering. When you take a bite. We love this thick sliced medium cheddar cheese to make the cheeseburgers extra cheesy when you go to the grocery store. There are so many options for buns, but today we are using a soft potato bun generously butter the cut sides of all of your buns. You can use softened or melted butter. We will be toasting the buns later to ensure they don't get soggy. Now let's make the secret sauces for these burgers and I'm going to share with you all of our favorite combinations. The first is mayonnaise mixed with a teaspoon of yellow. Mustard, the second is mayonnaise, mixed with Dijon mustard. Each of these have really good flavors. The 3rd is a simple fry sauce, which is Mayo and ketchup, and the 4th is my favorite with Mayo and barbecue sauce. These are so easy to whip up and really fun to serve all of them at a party. Once your toppings are prepared, Preheat your grill to medium and last but not least, we will make the patties the very best. Burgers are made with 8020 ground Chuck beef. The 20% fat content is perfect to ensure a juicy burger. And if you have a meat grinder and grind your own Chuck, that's even better. Divide the beef into 4 equal pieces. Shape each Patty to be about 1 inch wider than your burger bun. Since they do shrink a little on the grill. And try not to overwork the meat. Once your grill is preheated, season the patties generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Salt changes the structure of proteins and toughens burgers. So do not salt the ground beef until you are ready to grill. And season more than you think, since some of that seasoning will stick to the grill. And last but not least, make a little well in the center of each Patty, that little well will prevent the Patty from puffing up too much in the center. And it's a good clue for letting you know when the burger is ready to be flipped. Place the patties onto the hot grill grill for about 3 to 5 minutes per side and it really depends on how hot your grill is to get them just right, use a thermometer to check the internal temperature. Alexa ask Chuck knows beef how long until burgers are done. Ground beef should be cooked to a safe and savory 160 degrees Fahrenheit. You can see the juices accumulating and we have a good sear so we can flip the burgers. Cover and cook until the internal temperature of the beef registers at 160 degrees Fahrenheit. These are perfect. The cheese is melty and the buns are toasted. Beef is just a delicious, nutritious and high quality protein and there is no other protein like beef for making the best burgers. All right, it is party time and I want to get to building these burgers because I like my burgers hot and juicy. So we'll start with our toasted buttery bun. And then you get to pick your sauce. And my very favorite one is this barbecue one. So that's exactly what we're going to use. And the trick is to be generous. Nobody likes a dry burger. So put on a lot of stuff. We'll call it secret sauce, except there's no secret here. The secret is, it's easy. Alright, that looks good. And one thing I forgot to mention earlier is I love Pickles on my burgers, so I'll put that on the bottom bun. I love that little salty, crunchy, tangy bite. It makes them a little more restaurant style. OK now lettuce and I love a lot of lettuce, so we're going to layer this. That looks good and then two giant slices of tomato. All right, it already looks amazing and we haven't even gotten to the beef OK and then some fresh red onion. But it adds a nice vibrant pop of color and flavor. OK, now the best part the beef. OK, while the cheese is melty and it's warm and juicy. Da da da. Yum. Look at that. And I'm feeling good right now 'cause I get to do this taste test. Wow, OK. Here we go. It's like as big as my head. Look at that. OK, here we go. I'm a little intimidated right now, OK? I love how the natural flavor of the beef really shines in this recipe. WOW, tender juicy, so flavorful. Ho my beef. It's what's for dinner, literally. I mean, look inside of this burger. It is so juicy. You need napkins with this. And then just just indulge. It is so good. I hope you guys enjoy this recipe. If you did give us a great big thumbs up below. Make sure to subscribe to our channel and we'll see you next time.

#N3","If you needed proof that demons walk among us, look no further than the video we're about to play for you right here before I show it to you. For now, here, hit the red button down below to subscribe and tap that notification bells are the first to know when the latest news is published. This has to be one of the strangest videos from the border that we've ever seen here. At next news, a human smuggler growls like an animal, like a demon. After being arrested by Border Patrol agents. As bizarre as it seems, there might be a reason for this crazy behavior. Let's dig in, shall we? Christina Leila at the Gateway Pundit reports and a woman arrested for human smuggling and in Carrizo Springs, Texas last week growled at Border Patrol agents as they detained her. It's been reported that the smugglers are coached and told to act crazy if they get arrested so that they can go for an insanity defense watch. OK. What's your feeling? Now put your feet in so we can close the doors. OK. Are you going to close the door and stay right there before we move? Hey hey, calm down, calm down, calm down. Backed up backup. On an. Get your feedback in there. Get your foot back in there, ma'am, we're gonna have to Taser. You're not gonna like that. Take your feedback in. Bro. We're gonna have to. There is different in the different view. Unbelievable. They report that Border Patrol agents encountered nearly 2,000,000 illegal aliens in 2021. Thanks to Joe Biden's immigration policies quote large smuggling operations are abandoning migrants in dangerous situations at an alarming rate. In fiscal 2021, the Border Patrol rescued 12,877 migrants in the southwest border regions, compared to around 5000 in previous years. Last week, the Border Patrol rescued 25 undocumented migrants who have been left in a locked. Trailer with no way to escape according to the hill. Joe Biden's open border policies are deadly. 55 people died and more than 100 injured after a tractor trailer smuggling migrants from Guatemala, Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Honduras crashed into a bridge and flipped over in December. That truck was smuggling about 250 migrants when it crashed into a bridge in southern Mexico and flipped over last March. An SUV with about two dozen people crammed in it that was involved in a horrific crash with a tractor trailer in Holtville, California, killed over a dozen people. It was part of a cross border smuggling operation, according to sources within Customs and Border Patrol. Now this woman clearly unleashing her demons pretending to be crazy. That's right, but pretending to be crazy to get out of jail is not anything new. The mob used it all the time for their bosses. But to watch someone act like an animal, a demon on video is just setting up a defense later on. If you think this is kind of crazy, remember someone in California had murder charges reduced because of the. Winky defense. Do you think the smuggler is pretending to be crazy? Do you think it will work? Comment below. We'll see you in the next report for the next news network. I'm Gary Franchi. Thank you for watching that report. Now let's talk about some crypto news.

He's a ranking member of the House Budget Committee. Congressman Smith. Good morning. Your reaction to Biden's kind of dismissal of Lester Holt and all the Americans who were hurting who are seeing their wages fall when adjusted for inflation. The President needs to come to to to outstate America to real America to experience what everyday Americans facing whenever they go the grocery store to to put food on their table clothes on their backs or gasoline in their cars. The check engine light is on and flashing. And Biden's economy. We as Americans are facing the highest spike in prices in 40 years. We've surpassed 30 true $30 trillion in debt. Businesses have a chronic worker shortage. And then of course, the supply chain crisis has nowhere to an end, and it's all the result of Biden's economy. Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat telling the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve to quote do something on inflation. This is the White House is said to be asking Congress to pass more federal covertly funding. Is it really COVID relief? It's just spending Manchin, the senator writing this quote only in Washington DC. Do people seem to think that spending trillions more of taxpayers money? Will cure our problems, let alone inflation. Congressman your reaction to that. You absolutely cannot spend your way out of inflation, only only Joe Biden could spend $2 trillion on COVID and as a nation were less prepared, it's insane. It's probably because the original $2 trillion COVID package, less than 9% went towards COVID spending. But you know what? They spent more money like. $2,000,000 to plant trees in Syracuse, or $16 million for a golf course in Palm Beach. Give me a break they. They actually moved to $2 billion of COVID money that was supposed to go towards testing to house illegals at the southern border. It's unacceptable. Brian Jump in, yeah, congressman, forget about any more money appropriated for this. You already have hundreds of billions of dollars that have yet to be spent from the previous rounds of so called COVID relief. That's going to flow into the economy this year. The problem is, we're already set up for higher inflation going into this year. Really, the only thing that helps us out of it is if in a radical way businesses open up workers, go back to work at a faster rate and people get out and spend money on services, not just goods congressman but the president is so far behind on this. He is behind people in his own party who are getting it. He won't get it. He won't provide leadership and as a result it looks like we're going to open up too slowly. Congressman, is there anything you can do from your perch? To push him and push the country to open up supply and really start to get this under control. We have to continue to push like you said, the President has been a day late and a dollar short in every action. There's more than a half a trillion dollars of money that's still out there from the original COVID packages that have not been spent where inflation is right now, it's seven and a half percent. It's the highest in 40 years. But I'm really concerned under the policies of this administration that we're going to see double digits this year. If he does not stop the spending spree and does not address the supply chain crisis. We have real issues facing Americans. That's what we need to focus on. Unfortunately, this administration is focused on the most woke elitist policies and not those policies that directly affect working class Americans. Christian get in. Hey Mr. Smith, what's the GOP willing to do? You mentioned a $30 trillion deficit little less than that if you take out intergovernmental debt, but it's still way higher than than you know, in an entire year's GDP we spent, we had $3 trillion deficits in 2021 and we still have trillion dollar deficits. As far as the eye can see. You know the Tea Party was kicked off in 2010 by a trillion dollars in excess spending a generation earlier. Rosborough had an insurgency. Seems like this is one time where the public realizes. Government spending leads to something bad inflation, so you know the conventional wisdom would be don't propose a balanced budget that would give the Democrats something to attack, but I don't know. Maybe the maybe the GOP ought to do that for a change. You know last year was the first year in 11 years that we had no spending caps. We have to look at something to get our fiscal house in order. Last year alone, Congress, the House of Representatives passed more than seven and a half trillion dollars in new spending seven and a half trillion dollars of new spending it. It's unacceptable. Most Americans cannot comprehend what a trillion dollars is. A trillion bucks is. Imagine spending $1,000,000. Every day since Jesus Christ was born, you wouldn't even still spend a trillion bucks. That's how bad it is. Congressman. Thank you so much for being here. Congressman Jason Smith."

The government has laid special emphasis on encouraging people to get fully vaccinated. But the numbers reveal that millions who are eligible for their second dose have not come back for it.

#India #COVID19 #vaccination","Well in India the government is working hard to meet its target of vaccinating every adult in the country by the end of the year. That means getting everyone vaccinated with two doses. But data shows that millions of people have not returned for their second jobs, which is critical to combating COVID. Here's DWS, Nimisha Judge Wah with this story. Raj Bala knows everyone in her village. This especially comes in handy for her as a public health worker. Every day she walks through the village calling out peoples names who haven't taken the coronavirus vaccine yet. Pressing them to come to the village centre. Many here don't keep note of when they are due for their second dose. So she gives them a stern reminder on their doorstep. But for some it hasn't worked. 23 year old Tanya says she's too busy with housework and her infant daughter. Button for the probing. She admits that she's scared of getting a fever and body aches again. The nurse is more sympathetic to Tonya's mother's reasons. I can't walk from here to there. They help me up even to go to the bathroom. How will I go? I can't breathe very well either. Raj Bala promises to return to the house to give the elderly woman her second dose. The challenges Raj Bala faces are not unique. The Indian government found in October that over 100 million people were overdue for the 2nd dose. She has heard every reason for skipping full vaccination. Worry about fevers and apathy. Fueled by low case numbers are among the most common. The nurse has found her way around it when the carrot doesn't work, she says. The stick does. People have been told that they cannot access their pensions banks or their children schools if they aren't fully vaccinated. We've told the shops distributing food rations that they should only dispense them to those with their second shot. These unofficial mandates are reportedly used across the country. As health workers are pressed to meet a tight and ambitious deadline. India is to vaccinate its entire adult population by the end of this year. With the emergence of the Omicron variant, the government is now emphasizing on overcoming second dose hesitancy. Say we are all experts here. Say that complete vaccinations will be crucial to fighting off a third wave and building towards herd immunity against COVID-19. Whenever there's a new mutant which comes up, there's always a sort of a threat which looms around that. Other cases might go up and there will be a wave. Given what we've seen in the past with the. Devastation that the 2nd wave did in India. Lots of people lost their lives. We need to be very, very very vigilant and aggressive with vaccination. Radula says she's aggressive for a reason. She lost her younger brother in India second wave earlier this year. Her appeal to fellow villagers through both pleas and threats is to prevent a similar tragedy in their homes by getting the vaccine."

The Magh Mela festival, which includes bathing in the Ganges river, is one of the holiest pilgrimages in the Hindu faither. Last year's festival was described as a COVID-19 'superspreader' event. How are pilgrims and the authorities dealing with the Omicron variant, which is driving massive case surges across India?

#India #MaghMela #Covid19","2 Northern India now where 10s of thousands of Hindu pilgrims have gathered for a festival that includes bathing in the Ganges river. That's despite a huge jump in COVID-19 infections. A look now at how pilgrims and the authorities are dealing with the AMACAN variant, which is driving the surge. 10s of thousands of people come together to take the holy dip under the watchful eye of police. In some places authorities have sent up drones to sprinkle holy water on devotees. So they don't come too close to one another. But not everyone is listening to the authorities. Yeah, below people are standing here on the banks of the river and roaming around without any masks. Nobody is following the guidelines. Announcements are being made to urge people to wear masks. What can the government do? Nobody is following the rules. Cleaning it. India has recently had a massive surge in coronavirus cases fueled by the Omicron variant from an average of 8000 new cases a day in November to well over 200,000 now. Some devotees are unfazed. Aren't you scared of the coronavirus? I'm not scared of it. Why not? I believe it's a disease from the past and nothing else. Dozens of police and cleaning staff at the festival have already tested positive for the virus. Critics say the government has allowed the festival to go ahead despite the health risks. Out of fear of offending its Hindu voter base. They can bhagwan say we are praying to the gods that coronavirus will end and that we become free of this pandemic and we can resume our lives like before. Those prayers will be desperately needed to keep this festival from becoming another Super spreader event. Correspondent Nimisha Jaiswal now joins me from Delhi Nimisha. It sounds like the government has decided that the political risk of offending Hindu voters by shutting down or limiting the festival is worse than the health risk of allowing a potential super spreader event. Well, Michael, that is what many critics believe may be driving the decision of the state government to allow for this festival to continue in the state of Uttar Pradesh, which is going to be going to elections very soon. And this comes at a time when the neighboring state of Uttarakhand actually banned a holy dip during an auspicious day in the city of Haridwar which was the site of what turned out to be another similar Super Spreader event last year during India second wave. Now of course, local authorities insist that they're doing. Everything possible to allow for people to attend the festival while sticking by COVID protocols. There is wide testing. There's thermal screening. They booties are required to bring vaccination certificates and recent tests as well, but of course as we can see from the visuals, this is very hard to enforce. There are free masks being distributed, but many are choosing not to wear them. So nimisha, what is the government doing to curb the spread of the amacan variant? Will all restrictions right now Michael are being made by the state governments themselves. Many have shut down restaurants, gyms, public transport and put restrictions on marketplaces as well as workplaces. Major cities like Delhi and Mumbai which are seen sharp spikes have also installed night curfews as well as weekend cookies which are going on right now. Schools have been closed down in both these cities, but yet numbers continue to rise. Delhi has last reported a positive ITI rate of 30%. Which means that three of 10 people being tested in Delhi right now are turning out positive. Thank you very much. That's a DW correspondent Nimisha Jaiswal in Delhi."

That chant was then followed by a more pointed one at Smith, Warner, and Cameron Bancroft. The group of fans chants referring to the teary apologies from Smith, Warner, and Bancroft, they said, “Cry on the telly, we saw you cry on the telly.”","There's the Boeing. But the worst thing is doing it on the bus at the end of each day is play. Just the abuse. By the end of it, decide to laugh in the face of it. That takes immense courage. Saying that, it's just all part of trying to trying to embrace it. We just sort of just went with it. People were everywhere on the street. That's just how Edgbaston was. It was really. It was really. It was a really aggressive play. They're all growing me, no such children. I think everyone handled it pretty well. Yeah. And it seemed like that the whole way home there was just people just hurling abuse at the bus. It was. It was actually brilliant. Some of the things we were looking at off the bus.

Pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday, smashing windows and clashing with police as demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. in opposition to the certification by Congress of Joe Biden's presidential victory.

Debates over the certification of electoral votes of Arizona were taking place in both the House of Representatives and Senate when both were called into recess amid security concerns.

People could be seen on video storming through various hallways of the Capitol buildings, including both the House and Senate chambers, which appeared empty when people were seen inside. 

According to reports, a woman was also shot inside the building. It is not known what led to the shooting. Police later confirmed the woman had died.

The virus wave has unleashed a wave of prejudice against Indians in Britain. The government declared some South Asian-heavy areas in Britain 'red zones' after early reports of a concentration of the virus in these areas. But it soon found that the virus is not confined just to Indian areas. Watch the video to know more.

Crux BTS: https://bit.ly/3oCjbQE","There can be a lot in the name when you name a virus. Indian, and particularly if you're in Indian outside of India. In Britain, this new mutation of the virus that the World Health Organization has only just renamed Delta is being spoken of. Still as the Indian variant and that has unleashed a wave of prejudice against anyone. Seen as Indian. Actually with the Indian variant, I think it's safer to get the to get vaccinated as soon as possible. So that's why I've come here today. It's a shame that the virus was named as Indian variant. I think it's real shame because it is causing a lot of unhappiness. Lot of confusion amongst people but also the rightist people the nationalist people are using it as an excuse to bring. Xenophobia and racism into it. Just about every Indian looking person seems to be experiencing these attitudes somewhere or other somehow or other. Even if many don't like to admit it, it is quite obvious that amongst general population there is a fear of Indian people. So if there are Indian people walking on the street, they will walk a little bit further away from Indians. And when I say Indians, I mean all South Asians. Weather is Bangladeshis or Pakistanis or she Lankan we all look same. The government at first declared some Indian concentration areas for red zones. After cases surfaced there. But it found soon enough that the virus is not confined to these areas or of course to Indians. Everywhere is not just Indian areas. And the problem is not the Indians. Problem is the virus for God sake. This virus is very different. It spreads very quickly, much faster than the previous strains of the virus is. So it can be any individual or it can be any particular group of people that are spreading. The virus is spreading everywhere is spreading fast. But there is a. Crucial difference between the delta variant in India and the same variant in Britain. Fortunately, I think we are very lucky in this country that vaccination has progressed quite a lot and that's why we don't see the impact of the virus as it happened in India. India and Indians will be blamed if the lifting of the lockdown due on June the 21st gets delayed. The prevalence of the virus will double as the fault of an Indian neighbour been in this country for long time. The majority of the English or UK population are very sensible people. Of course, like any country, there are people who are extreme nationalist and they take advantage of such situations. I hope that the sense will prevail in this country. I think the government here has been sensible and will remain sensible and hopefully. There may be occasional incidences, but in general the blame game will not be there against Indians. Indian variant is now the Delta variant is not a change that many people and many in the media have taken up in a hurry. In any case, a lot of people given this wave of prejudice will simply translate delta to mean Indian and to an Indian that can mean being avoided. Well like the plague."

More reports: http://www.dw.com/en/program/focus-on-europe/s-101185-9798","679 cent OK. Their quest for safety took them to this refugee hostel in Dresden. The 30 men were on the road for months. They're from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. Danielle Molitor helps them get settled. The head of the shelter wants them to feel comfortable. Smash Boss might enjoy this. I don't want to give it up or do without it. I could do without the harassment. That would be nice if that were absent from the start. Racist thugs and Neo Nazis have been gathering outside the building since the refugees moved in. Danielle films their gatherings. Mulitas says they're trying to intimidate them. He's received death threats himself. Spider hobby shouldn't help. I've had two. I've been told to hang myself or they'd like to lynch me and that they'll get me eventually. Asthma. They're also threatening him on social media if you keep on talking like that. It says one day you'll be whisked off in a dark car and never seen again. The city of Dresden has commissioned security guards to protect the hostel. The shelter has already been attacked several times. It's been pelted with stones, bottles and stink bombs. Many people who live in the neighboring buildings don't want the refugees around. One has come to complain he wants to remain anonymous. Daniel Molito listens to what he has to say. Do you find those in the English French now English have national pride. Ours was broken when our grandfathers lost a war and now we're the wimps we have to take in all these people. Now. Molly talk keeps his cool, no matter how racist the statements get, he says dialogue is the only way to overcome racism. Let's lower the aggression level and focus on what really matters. Then we can make the best of it. The racist thugs show up outside like they do almost every day. Yaya Nasri has been in Germany for two months. He's keeping an eye on the other side of the street. He's afraid of the men out there. German people in this year and other people is really crazy. There's a look in this one, this one. What is this? Abdul Habib's money says the thugs aren't a problem compared to the threats he faced in Afghanistan. It left I thought that is very bad. I gonna kill my Talibans. I skipped out. I came to Germany. Now I don't know right now Germany. And then added guys better than Taliban thought like calendar molliter wants these people fleeing war to experience peace and he wants peace for his hotel in Dresden today. There having a party to finally relax in spite of the resistance they experience daily. This neighbor wants to complain. She says the refugees were sitting on a flat roof and that will wreck the roofing. Yes, wrecking the roofing is a problem that shouldn't happen. But she also says she's getting used to the foreigners and is getting acquainted with them little by little. Come on, Tim. We're surprised because they're relatively decent to others. And as if by Edna's message. People unknown. Security guards have to patrol to protect the party. But everyone still tries to have a good time. I'm 80 and he's 18. We've gotten that far. Molitor's enjoying the party too, despite the intimidation. When I look outside and this is the time when they usually show up to protest us. And there's no one there, right? That's our first triumph, so we'll keep going. Thank you. Carrying on refusing to be intimidated and standing firm against racism, it's a start. But everyone knows that tomorrow the Neo Nazis could well be back."

Let's bring in the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump, Mr. President, thank you so much for joining Fox and Friends weekend. Well, thank you. It's an honor and we have a lot of problems in this country. But it's an honor to be with you. Well, we're grateful to have you, Sir. Well, let's start with with the headline. We've had all morning long, you know what's happening in Russia, what's happening in Ukraine? The White House right now is saying an attack could happen at any time on your assessment. Where are we and and how did we get here? Well, first of all, it's shocking because this should have never happened. That should have never happened. It would not have happened and how we got here is the when they watched. Afghanistan, and they watched the most incompetent withdrawal in the history of probably any army, let alone just us. They saw that and President Xi and President Putin watch what happens with China versus but with Taiwan. But they watched that and they said. What's going on? They don't know what they're doing, and all of a sudden I think they got a lot more ambitious. I think Putin really wanted to negotiate for a period of time. I think when he watched Afghanistan when he watched that unbelievably bad withdrawal incompetent where they took the military out first where they left $85 billion worth of equipment behind for the Taliban to have. And this talent to use. And then of course, the death, the death that happened when they watched all of that. I think they got emboldened. President Trump Joe Biden is scheduled to be on a call today with Vladimir Putin. What do you think he can say? What should he say if you were in office today? What would you say to Vladimir Putin? Well, I I wouldn't be in this position because we're in a very bad position right now and it would have. As I said, it would never have happened. I know him very well, got along with him very well. I stopped his pipeline, I sanctioned them more than anybody ever sanctioned them. Nobody was ever tougher on Russia but I got along with Putin very well. We respected each other. I think you have a whole different ball game right now. This is just an exercise. He's not going to tell him anything and I don't think Putin at this point going to be listening. It's going to be very interesting to see what he does in terms of the the depth, what he will he take a small piece. Yeah, when Biden originally said that he's going in, everybody was like did he just say that nobody could believe it, but he said it and it was almost like a card. Ukraine went crazy when he when he saw that when they heard that the president but now the phone call I I think is perfunctory. I don't think much is going to come out of it. Yes, Sir. Republicans have introduced a bill that would block aid to Ukraine until our southern border is secure. The thinking is why would we be worried about a border in Europe when there is a disaster happening right here at home? Do you think that those two issues should be linked? Well, I certainly understand how people feel. We had the strongest border we've ever had our southern border. We were three weeks away from finishing the wall after going through 2 1/2 years of lawsuits with the Democrats and winning them all. We were two and a half three weeks away from think of it finishing the wall, which is largely frankly finished anyway. It's a tremendous help. We had the best numbers in the history of our country on the southern border. Very little was coming in. Very few people were coming in other than coming in legally. We had the lowest. With drug numbers, the best drug numbers in the last 32 years and they were getting much better rapidly and all of a sudden. This guy takes over and the border is open that we have millions of people. I think it's 10 million. They say 3,000,000. But people coming in countries all over the world are releasing their prisoners into our country. Would like a dumping ground so I can certainly understand how people feel when they say, you know, let's try and tie one to the other. You know we fight for other people's borders but we don't fight for our own border. We had the strongest, the most secure border we've ever had. At the South and in Mexico is was great to me. They helped us have gave us 28,000 soldiers free of charge, because otherwise we would have measured no tariffs. All of their cars and things coming in and we got along great with Mexico. We had the Mexico stay in Mexico policy. Now it's called stay in the United States. Whoever you are, it's just come on in. No. It's it's a very terrible thing and I I must tell you I do understand how they feel. When we're fighting for other countries, but we're not fighting for our own. Yeah Mr. President, not only we fighting for our own, we're facilitating that transportation with secret flights in the middle of the night. Things you've heard about as well, but I wanna go to our other border if we can. Mr. President, and the idea of of truckers and the trucker freedom convoy that's happening there, not just in Ottawa but now on trade routes along the Canadian border? You've heard what you know, who you call them Justin from Canada. What Justin Trudeau has said about them? He's characterized them as as as racist as as bigots. But their message has been clear from the beginning, Mr. President, the list of their demands has been terminate. Vaccine passports, terminate, vaccine mandates and stop the divisive rhetoric they've been straight forward. They want freedom. What's your message to both the freedom Convoy and Justin Trudeau? People all over the world are watching and they have respect for what they're doing. They're tired of being pushed around by incompetent people being told what to do. Being forced with the mandates, the mandate should have not happened. I mean, I'm very proud of warp speed. Everybody is giving us credit. Nobody thought it was possible to do what we did, and that includes therapeutics. By the way, we generated the various therapeutics that works so well. But what we did with warp speed was great, but the mandates are very, very bad. Very very bad, and I think there's a lot of respect. For what they're doing, I see they have Trump signs all over the place and I'm. I'm proud that they do, but that's what happens. You can push people so far, and our country is a tinderbox too. Don't kid yourself. And there are plenty of our country up there right now, folks. The When you look at what's happening when you look at what's happening in Canada, our country, I think is far more of a tinderbox than Canada. President Trump were watching blue states begin the process of loosening restrictions across the country. In my one chance to interview in the past, President Trump, I asked you about Doctor Fauci. You were at the front end on so many things as we panicked as a nation. You talked about balancing the shutdowns against our economy and I asked you at that time about Doctor Fauci and the way the public viewed him and you were beginning at that time to express some skepticism. I'm curious and I'm not trying to give you the answer ahead of time, but I'm curious if you look back on the past two years, some of which was under your watch. When it comes to COVID, what would you have done? What would you do differently if put in the same position with with perfect hindsight? What, if anything, would you do differently? Well, we haven't been given credit, but we're starting to get credit. Warp speed was phenomenal. I closed up the country to China. I closed up the country to Europe. That was incredible and I filled the shelves. I filled up the covers of the states which they were unable to do themselves. You had some very confident governors and had some very incompetent governors. But you know, I I went around with the cupboards were bare and they were as far as fouchy and that was a big thing. The ventilators that. All of the equipment and all of the things that we're able to get from goggles to clothing and the plastics and we we we did an amazing job. Got no credit for it, but everything is stocked and right now the whole country is stocked for something like this. We, the country and this is long before I get there was not prepared fouchy however was not a big factor with me. He is a big factor now because Biden chose to make such but he was not a big factor with me. He said he didn't want to close to. As you know very strongly as we talked about this, he didn't want to close up to China, which was heavily infected. He didn't want to close up to Europe, which was heavily infected. Four months later, he said that President Trump made a great decision and saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives, 'cause I wasn't really a single vote. I had 21 people in a room, and none of them wanted to close it down, but I did because I saw what was happening in China and in Europe, found she did not. Players bigger role with me played actually a pretty light role and if you also notice often times when he would say something, I do the opposite, which tended to be pretty good. You know he came out against masks and then he became a radical masker. He was a radical, you know where four if you could, but at the very beginning if you look back early on he was against masks. I've been he. He had some very different views but he was not a big factor with me. I didn't get to see him too much. I didn't deal with him too. But I made my own decisions and they were great decisions and I left the state run. So whether it's Florida, Texas, South Dakota, if you if you take a look at some of the states to South Carolina, they did a terrific job. The governor did a terrific job, but I let the states run and make those decisions. And frankly, the Republican governors did a far better job than the Democrat governors, but found she was not a big factor as far as. I was concerned he became a very big factor once Biden came in and then it's almost like he couldn't make a move without asking fouchy well, Mr. President. Over the past week, something very interesting has happened. Several Democratic governors have dropped mask mandates, or at least pulled back on mask mandates. And there's this clip that's going viral. It took place at a Las Vegas school children. So excited that they don't have to wear their masks to school. The next day. Take a listen to the what that sounded like. Watch this. Starting tomorrow, we don't. Ask Lenny. You know, I think that would put a smile on everybody's face, but just juxtaposed that to what President Biden said about easing mask restrictions, he said. It's premature. The CDC also said that now is not the time if now is not the time. When is. Well, first of all that's adorable. It should have happened a long time ago and everybody says that the mask for the new variant, at least, is virtually ineffective. I mean, totally ineffective, so I don't know what they're doing and why they're doing it, but they've come out and said that the mask has almost no impact, especially on the new variant, and I just don't. It's inconceivable what's going on. But a lot of the states are opening up, and I think politically it would be unacceptable. It's just not gonna be able to hang out too much longer. It's ridiculous, but you know that clip is so beautiful to watch, but it just happened a long time ago."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4MzDc_57AU,"India slays Pak at UNSC; Says 'most terror attacks have origins, one way or other, in Pakistan'","India has strongly hit back at Pakistan after Islamabad’s envoy to the UN Munir Akram raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during an UNSC Open Debate on ‘Protection of civilians in armed conflict. India calling out Pakistan said that J&K was, is and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India. Furthermore India slammed Pakistan for harbouring 26/11 Mumbai attack perpetrators in their country.

#India #UN #Pakistan #Kashmir","I'm constrained to take the floor again only because the representative of Pakistan. Chose to sully this August council through his pavlovi and and frivolous remarks against my country. While his statement deserves our collective contempt, it is important for me to set the record straight. This is not the first time the representative of Pakistan has misused platforms provided by the UN to propagate false and malicious propaganda against my country, and seeking in vain to divert the world's attention from the sad, sad state of his country where terrorists enjoy free pass while the lives of ordinary people, especially those belonging to the minorities, are turned upside down. Madam President Member States are well aware that Pakistan has an established history of harboring, aiding and actively supporting terrorists. This is a country that has been globally recognized as a sponsor of terrorism, and holds the ignoble record of hosting the largest number of terrorists prescribed by the Security Council. So much so that most of the terrorist attacks around the world today have their origin in some form or the other in Pakistan. His Prime Minister and his foreign minister have been called out for being supporters of terrorists, including Osama bin Laden. But they continued to carry on down the same path and deterred.

The biggest threat to civilians comes from terrorists as we mentioned earlier, the perpetrators of the heinous terror attack in Mumbai in 2008 continue to enjoy patronage of the state which she represents. Madam President let me be categorical about India's position. The entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh where are and will always be an integral and linear inalienable part of India irrespective of what the representative of Pakistan believes or covets. This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan and we call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation. India desires normal, neighborly relations with all countries, including Pakistan. And is committed to address addressing outstanding issues, if any bilaterally and peacefully in accordance with the Simla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration. However, any meaningful dialogue can only be held in an atmosphere free of terror, hostility and violence. The onus is on Pakistan to create such a conducive atmosphere. Building India will continue to take firm and decisive steps to respond to cross border terrorism. Thank you."

Canada has already done so, but Global Affairs says nearly 800 registered Canadians are still there. 
 
Canada’s diplomatic staff has been relocated to a temporary office in Lviv, Ukraine after operations at the Canadian embassy in Kyiv were suspended, according to Minister of Foreign Affairs Mélanie Joly.
 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered support to Ukraine’s president in a phone call today, but as Jennifer Johnson reports, some are urging him to do more.

#GlobalNews #UkraineRussiaStandoff #UkraineBorder","U.S. intelligence reports Russia has 80% of its forces ready to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine. More than 100,000 Russian troops are amassed along Ukraine's border, and the rest are on route. Missiles and other military equipment are in place to we're in the window when a Russian invasion could start at any time. If President Putin so decides. That includes in the coming days, U.S. President Joe Biden held a high stakes call with Russian President Vladimir Putin Saturday, urging him to stand down. the US Embassy is being evacuated. Only core diplomatic staff will remain. American citizens are being told to leave the country to Biden is warning Putin not to harm any Americans. I'm hoping that if in fact he's foolish enough to go in, he's smart enough not to, in fact, do anything that would negatively impact on American citizens. U.S. soldiers helping to train Ukraine's army have also reportedly left the country, but an additional 3000 American troops are heading to Poland, joining 2000. Others already deployed to Eastern Europe. These are not soldiers who are being sent to go fight Russia in Ukraine. They're going to defend NATO territory. Putin is trying to stop Ukraine from joining NATO, giving an international military protection. The Canadian government is also urging its citizens to leave Ukraine, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, which represents roughly 1. Point 4,000,000 Canadians of Ukrainian heritage wants the Trudeau government to punish Russia immediately. We think that it's time to do some sanctions today, tomorrow, the next week, so that Putin understands that we're serious about this and he can face some consequences if there is an invasion. the US and its allies are promising punishing economic sanctions against Putin and his billionaire backers blocking financial transactions around the world for now. Putin denies he plans an attack which experts say would have devastating effects. There would be a. Very bad humanitarian crisis and loss of life. Several world leaders have offered to negotiate a diplomatic solution to the situation, but Putin has rebuffed those attempts. Now attends world watches and waits for what could be the greatest security crisis between Russia and the West. Since the Cold War. Jennifer Johnson Global news Washington."

#masterchef #masterchefuk #howtocook","For today's lunch, Gilly has designed a starter inspired by dim sum and based around the local favorite roast duck. To serve it pink like European style, yeah most of the deck I've seen has been cooked through, yeah, but then I you know at the restaurant yesterday you know a lot of the meat there was served pink, you know, is that kind of East meets West. To accompany the duck, chili is making a hoisin sauce from black bean paste. Fusion cooking and potsticker dumplings, potsticker cried on one side, so crispy on one side and then steamed on the top so soft on top. Filled with duck meat. There's 90 minutes until the VIP guests arrive. Now four really stepped up the map, keeping their own personality on the plates, but at the same time, the influences of Hong Kong would be able to see through every single dish John. If they get this right, it could be magical. Gilleys duck breasts have been cooked on the crown. I'm going to take the breast off and then time fry it at the end and she's come feed the leg meat to make a filling for her dumplings. Technique and once you got it, it's OK. But until that point it can be a bit messy. Getting their next one will be better. For the starter is pan fried duck with hoisin sauce. The Chinese they would like the duck a little bit more cooked Western cuisine. It would be more pink. Potsticker dumpling well I'm DJ. Anger. Take my support how I go? Jelly your face. Burn. Julie has just burnt the complete batch of pots out there then. I'm not sure she's gonna have the time to do another batch. What can we do? It doesn't matter, you can help me. Also, what can what can I do now? Do you want these in circles? Yeah, and then you can help me. So I've got loads to do. Cheers. We've got a few minutes, so we're gonna try and get something together. You're fine. Is everything else ready Julie? Besides that, everything is just the pot stickers. It's going right. OK Julie, I can help. Cheers. Don't burn them. Lovely color. I like that a lot. You weren't presenting dishes like this a month ago. Look at that. Yeah service please. Chili has served pan fried roast duck breast with spring onion puree, potsticker dumplings filled with comfy duck leg, packed choy and mushrooms. Pickle cucumber chive oil and a hoisin sauce. This is literally one mistake. You just take your eye off something. I was cutting the duck and then they just weren't on the bottom. Like the duck, it looked quite. Pink for me, but the skin is very crispy. The hoisin sauce is actually quite nice. The flavor inside is powerful, so I think the balance is there. The Spring Onion. Is very smooth in terms of flavor. It's quite balanced. I think it's quite well done. I wanted to congratulate you guys for your efforts. It was really, really spectacular. I think there were some dishes kind of very high restaurant level, so you guys should be very proud of yourself. So congratulations. What an amazing experience. We bought our four to this incredible city of Hong Kong and they have immersed themselves in it. What will that do's them as cooks from here on in?"

He's a member of the House Judiciary Committee in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Congressman, thanks for being with us this morning. You've heard the news. What's your reaction with? Well, President Trump was right. Remember back in 2017? Well when when President Trump said they were spying on me in the press and all the Democrats said no, they weren't. And then in 2019 then Attorney General Bill Barr said spying took place at the FBI on President Trump's campaign and everyone said no, no, no. Well, now we know for sure. Now we know 100% John Durhams Revelation germs filing here. Yep, there was spying going on and it was worse than we thought. 'cause they were spying on the sitting president of the United States. And it goes right to the Clinton campaign. So God bless John Derman is investigation has taken a long time. But we're getting to now what we all suspected. The only thing we didn't understand was it was worse than we thought. Congressman, just as a quick follow up here. I think everyone as they watch this wonders. Where will this go? Where will accountability lead us who will be held accountable? I got to know a little bit earlier in the show and I want to run this by you. I don't know if this is directly within your knowledge but within federal crimes there's a five year statute of limitations. We're talking about stuff now from 2016. Seventeen are we already looking at something that has expired in terms of accountability, at least within the justice system? Look, I I don't know, only John Durham knows that. I do know that some of these filings that he's done on Zussman and Danchenko were running up close to that five year statute of limitations and. And we do know this John Durham is going right back to the start. Understand the indictment against Zussman wasn't about Zussman lying to John Durham in his investigative team. It was about the original lies, the lies that took place in 2016 when they started this whole concerted effort to go after a presidential campaign. That that is what is so frightening here. You had the government working with the Clinton campaign. To go after the Republican Party's nominee for president to spy on that campaign, we've never seen anything like this in history. So President Trump's statement yesterday, I think, is right on target. This is truly unprecedented. Truly something that has never happened in the history of our great country. And then when you couple it with the context, the broader context of a few years ago, it was the Democrats using the IRS to target conservatives. Then it was this issue five years ago with them going after President Trump campaign. And now we know just four months ago. The Department of Justice has set up this threat tag label and they are putting that threat tag that label on moms and dads showing up at school board meeting. So when you view it in context, it's even more frightening. Sure is congressman. You mentioned the way the media has characterized this, of course, from the beginning they they denied, not just denied it, but pursued the official narrative of those peddling this to the FBI and to the media. We just want to remind our viewers with a bit of a flashback. Here's how the media and Democrats characterized the Durham probe. Watch this. The biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign. They spied on my campaign. There's no real evidence of that. Of course there is. It's all over the place, Leslie. Space Spider, my campaign, and they got called Donald Trump and William Barr promised that Durham would expose huge corruption, but he hasn't done that is apparently an ongoing concerted Republican and Pro Trump project. To try to turn the investigation of the Russia scandal into some kind of scandal itself. Oh no. OK wait till the Doom report comes out and and then nothing happens and they just move on to the next conspiracy theory. It is never going to end. And guess what? People who want to believe that BS are going to believe it. So congressman, yet again we go to that word, misinformation. So it was conspiracy theories and misinformation, until it's proven not to be, yeah. Well, the conspiracy theory in the misinformation came from Adam Schiff the Democrats in the mainstream press. Remember what Schiff said? There is more than circumstantial evidence that President Trump worked with the Russians. That was false, completely false. The media reported it. It's proven to be false, but I tell you what, there is certainly now more than circumstantial evidence that the Democrats and the FBI and the Clinton campaign spied on President Trump's campaign. So yeah, the the country sees it. It seems like everything they call us for. On misinformation and quote conspiracy theory actually turns out to be true, and they're the ones peddling the false narratives all the time. Yeah, I mean I have to tell you Congressman, I first of all, I was really surprised to hear that these indictments came out that this investigation was still going. I kind of thought maybe it would not. I mean, that's how much of a loss. So did Don Lemon. Yeah, John Lemon thought the same thing but but I mean, I think all of us wonder, you know who's going to be held accountable? I mean, you saw those three guys, but how far up do you think this can go? Because I don't, I mean, the American people need to regain their trust in government. This is third world stuff this. As you said, it's like Watergate, but this is weaponizing government and our intelligence agencies and working with big tech. I mean this is really big stuff. Yeah, no, and again I I think it's important to view all this in context. You think about what the Democrats have done. The Democrats just this year. The Democrats have closed the capital, allow proxy voting kick Republicans off committee won't let Republicans for the first time in American history serve on a Select Committee. They're trying to end the Electoral College trying to end the filibuster, trying to pack the court, trying to let noncitizens vote. The January 6th Committee has altered evidence and lied to the American people about it. And now we find out, oh, by the way, the Democrats Democrat Campaign Committee of Hillary Clinton. Was spying on the sitting president of the United States. You view it all in context. Let's hope people are held accountable. I know when former director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe was was was director, he he made sure that certain documents were made available to Durham about that. That the top people in the intelligence division under under the under President Obama. So we'll see where Brennan or McCabe or comedy or any of these guys. We'll see what happens. I don't know. Only John Durham knows, and obviously he is being persistent. He is being methodical about this entire investigation. We'll see where it all shakes out you you do get the sense, congressman. It's going somewhere the way that Durham is conducting this in the quiet and by the way, this revelation wasn't one that he put out there, right? It wasn't, it was in a small filing over a conflict of visions in a filing. So it seems like this could be headed somewhere. This investigation does have a an end point. Our Democrats nervous right now are the people who are, you know, involved in this conspiracy. Do you fully believe that they are nervous at this point, that they're worried that they might be held accountable? I mean, again, I don't know what I what I do suspect is how did? How did Jim Baker, the top lawyer at the FBI, the chief counsel at the FBI, when Zussman is hanging him? This information on Alpha Bank. And all this, supposing a coordination between Trump and these folks in Russia, how did Jim Baker not know Zussman was with Perkins Kui and Zussman was representing, not? How did he not know that he wasn't representing the Clinton campaign? I think he had to know that. So I mean, I don't know for sure, but it seems to me that that makes makes makes sense to me. So we'll again see where this investigation goes. Maybe he would want plausible tonight. Deniability real quick. Inside this filing it names tech executive number one tech company number one. In your experience, do we eventually learn who those people are? I I assume so, but again, I'm I. I think Mr Durham is gonna move through this in a in a in a methodical way, as as evidenced by the fact that now what been three years. But again, the American people deserve the truth. We wanna know that what, what exactly happened and we wanna make sure that this kind of stuff never happens again and that the government quits quits weaponizing the the the the things they have to go after American citizens that's true, thank you, Congressman. Hold on real quick. Total change of gears. You're from Ohio. Who do you like today in the big game, you bet. Well, who do you think Joe Boro in the Bengals for goodness sake? Of course we like that. Yeah he was gonna say LA that's what he was gonna do. Thank you Sir. He would not have won the next election. Thanks, Congressman, thank you got it. I'm Steve doocy.

#N3","Delusional Jen Psaki ignores Biden's inflation failures and tries to blame high meat prices on big meat. Thanks for watching next news network. I'm Ivory Hecker filling in from my channel search Ivory Hecker on YouTube before I get to this report. If you are new to next news, allow me to welcome you to subscribe by tapping that red button down below. Biden sinking poll numbers have the White House looking to blame everyone but themselves for the high inflation we are all experiencing. Look no further than Jen Psaki trying to blame me. Companies for higher meat prices instead of rampant government spending that most economists say is causing it. Sadly, people in the White House are just as close clueless as Biden is John Hanson from the political insider reports on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki repeated her claim that meat companies, specifically the conglomerate of big meat, are to blame for increasing meat prices. Amid the inflation, that has only gained steam, beef prices specifically are up 20% compared to a year ago. Saki placed the blame squarely on big meat. Saki made her remarks during the Daily White House press briefing. Take a listen. Tyson Foods stock went up very high yesterday. I think its highest in about two years on the back of record profits on rising meat prices, partially at prices rising meat prices. So how does that pose good challenge that your administration and efforts to address competition in that industry. Well, just four large conglomerates control the majority of the market for beef, pork and poultry products and the data shows. And I think they're record profits or evidence of this that there have been increases in meat prices. Well, the companies have generated recent record profits. And that's a good example of it, and I would just note just if you look at historical precedent here. 50 years ago, ranchers got over $0.60 for every dollar of family spent on beef. Today they get about 39 cents. 50 years ago, hog farmers got 40 to $0.60 for each dollar they spent today. It's about $0.19, and the big companies are still making major profits. It certainly shouldn't work that way. And as the president said, many times capitalism without competition isn't capitalism, it's exploitation, and we have continued concern about the lack of competition in these industries. Right? Wow, well in December, Saki said the inflation was due to quote corporate greed. Take a listen. There are several progressive groups and lawmakers who are increasingly vocal Ising. The idea that inflation, high inflation is being driven by corporate greed by including companies with high profits, some of whom have met at the White House with the President in recent months. Does the President endorsed that idea? Does he think the corporate greed is the big driver of inflation right now? I think that the President thinks the way people across the country, American Families Digest inflation is by price increases and if you look at industry to industry, it's a little different. So for example. The president, the Secretary of Agriculture have both spoken to what we've seen as the greed of meat conglomerates. That is, an area where people go to the grocery store and they're trying to buy a pound of meat, £2.00 of meat, £10 of meat. It is. The prices are higher, that is in his view, and the view of our Secretary of Agriculture because of you could call it corporate greed short. You could call it jacking up prices during a pandemic. There are other areas where we've seen increases because of supply chain. Issues and we're seeing those increases around the world as it relates to gas prices, oil supply, and things along those lines. So I would say there's some areas where we have seen corporations benefit profit from the pandemic, and and certainly the President would agree with that component. I I don't know the full context of all of their remarks. Saki's comments are a common refrain from the left in that all societal ills are invariably caused by quote, greed or capitalism. Never mind that the federal government has widely ramped up spending during the pandemic, or that the Federal Reserve continues to pump the economy. Biden and his team never take responsibility for their actions on creating this insanely high inflation. Blame someone else for high meat and food prices. Do that for high gas prices as well. People are struggling to pay bills every month, and Biden's team has the nerve to say this is the best economy ever. Who are they kidding? Our economy is collapsing and they are too delusional to see it. Do you agree? Comment below. Subscribe for updates. If you like what we're doing here, give us a thumbs up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZvplPk_peQ,What is the role of Nato in the Russia-Ukraine crisis? - BBC News,"As tensions grow in Eastern Europe, the role of Nato is crucial in our understanding of Russia’s troop build-up near the border with Ukraine, and the West’s reaction to it.

The BBC's Ros Atkins explains.

#Russia #Ukraine #BBCNews","Russia is amassing troops close to the border of Ukraine. It's carrying out military exercises with Belarus, and President Biden has this message if Russia makes a choice to further invade Ukraine, we are jointly ready and all of NATO is ready. NATO is a Western military alliance. The president says it's ready and Russia is focused on it too. So email me the NATO member countries continue to send a large amount of modern weapons to Ukraine to contribute to the modernization of the Ukrainian military. NATO members are flying in what they call lethal aid to Ukraine across Eastern Europe. NATO is bolstering its defenses. These are British forces on the Poland, Belarus border and Russian concerns about NATO and Eastern Europe are not new. We will also have to look about those missile installations in in Romania and Poland or anywhere. On NATO, Russia is looking to the future and the past. It wants NATO to promise that Ukraine will never join and it wants NATO to withdraw its military deployments of recent years from Eastern Europe. There's no chance of either demand being met and to understand why we need to go back to the aftermath of the Second World War. NATO is set up in 1949 by 12 countries. Their mission was to secure peace in Europe to promote cooperation among its members and to guard their freedom in reality. This meant countering the growing power of the Soviet Union, and at the heart of NATO strategy to do this was and is Article 5. It says an attack on one member is considered an attack on all of them. The idea is collective defence, and now with 30 members, NATO continues to state its purpose. Together we are 50% of the world's military might and economic might. So as long as we stand together in NATO North American Europe, we are all safe. In recent years though, NATO. Purpose has been questioned. Donald Trump said the US might leave Emmanuel Mccrone said NATO was brain dead. There are also questions of commitment. Some NATO members are behind on NATO's military spending targets. And then there's Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 attacks. NATO triggered it's Article 5 NATO members supported America's attack on al Qaeda and the Taliban. 20 years later, the US chose to leave Afghanistan unilaterally with NATO members left to follow suit. For this and for other reasons too, as the BBC's catcher Adler notes, the longevity of the current show of unity between Western allies isn't guaranteed. Now, whether Russia sees that as a chance, we can't know some argue this crisis has galvanized the NATO alliance, but what is clear is that NATO's expansion has angered Vladimir Putin. We won't move one inch towards the east. They told us in the 1990s and what happened they deceived us. They brazenly tricked us. That claim is disputed. NATO's expansion, though, is not the countries here in purple joined before 1997. Since then, the 14 in Yellow had their request to join, accepted. Many of them are former Soviet states. Five share a border with Russia. Moscow sees all of this as a major threat to its security. Any opposed the continuation of NATO's open border policy and further movement towards our borders is exactly what threatens us. NATO is not a development institution, it is an instrument of confrontation. It's quite obvious that it's expansion poses a threat to US. Russia doesn't see NATO as defensive, it sees it as an extension of American power. It sees its very existence as a reduction of Russian power and Ukraine finds itself right in the middle of Russian efforts. To resist that it shares borders with Russia and the European Union, and while it's not a NATO member, it's what NATO calls a partner country. That means it could join in the future. And Russia is using its military to make it clear that that mustn't happen, which brings the EU to this conclusion. We are leaving. To my understanding. The most dangerous moment for the security in Europe after the end of the Cold War. And in this dangerous moment Russia sees NATO aggression. NATO sees only defense. What we all see is NATO and Russia playing their part in a global power struggle where China is coming and America's superpower is being put to the test. In a recent essay, Tom Mctague wrote in the Atlantic that moment when we in the West, or bathe contentedly under the American son, has gone in that context, he argues, Putin then is a modern man reacting to the modern world using modern methods in an attempt to make something new. NATO stands in the way of the new world that Putin would like. That's why whatever the rights and wrongs the causes of this crisis and the outcome of it both connect to NATO."

Brazil is far right, President has decided to go ahead with the visit to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Bolsonaro's visit comes amid heightened tensions between the United States and Russia over the ongoing Ukraine crisis. The visit, which Bolsonaro claims is about building trade relations between Brazil and Russia, has sparked fears of intensifying tensions. In an already worsening conflict, Bolsonaro is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to discuss various issues concerning both the countries Bolton. Arrows combined the trip with an official visit to Hungary, where he will meet fellow far right leader, Viktor Orban. Critics say Bolsonaro's visit to Moscow comes with terrible timing.

Whether you are a fan of Masterchef, Junior Masterchef, Masterchef the Professionals or Celebrity Masterchef, you're in the right place.","So. Whose dish should we taste first? Maybe I'll pick up. Ordinary person like me who gets a chance to cook for Marco. That's a big achievement and getting it tasted is a double achievement for me. Wow, I like the look of it. What is it? Cream pepper, chicken, but flaky paratha and potato crisps. This is a very simple dish, but this is quite close to my heart. Why I always do this this when I'm not having a good day or something and it's easy and it's flavorful and it's full of fat, so I like it. I like the idea of a dish that you make for yourself when you're not having a great day, that's that's beautiful. Should we taste it? Nidhi in 35 years have been in this industry. I've never seen a dish look like that. Taste so good. It's delicious. The combination of chicken fat and that black pepper, which is beautifully balanced and that little squeeze of lemon sensation. The crisps a little bit of snow. Well done. Get it nailed, the brief and the brief was simplicity. Tasty, yummy. That's what more can we say. Definitely have to have a run after that, that's for sure. Yeah. Looking for a legend, not everybody gets a chance. Only I can say is that. Must that done something too good in life?"

It's not raw fish, I was like did somebody somebody like sashimi or something? Howard bring that dish up. Even without tasting it, you know immediately it's raw. It won't even separate. I'm just amazed. This kind of is what ****** us off and these kind of dishes are what sends you home. I'm supposed to eat this really. You know, watching you cook. This was just a let down. We're going to go from 11 down to 10 and this is what you bring. It's the most important this your life guys. You see this. This is. Just got real. This is not good. Holy, I'm going home today. Stop. You gotta be kidding me. Plan this is like a buffet gone bad. Go back to your station. I'm not tasting this crap. You guys have to at this point in the competition, you need to be listening to what we're telling you about what we're producing because. This is ridiculous. Jennifer. At this I have to make a point of because this is not even about cooking about technique. This is a complete disaster. This lamb is raw, it's completely wrong. You can't. You take this thing and you cut it in half. It would be dangerous to serve a piece of lamb like this to a judge. This is raw raw. Do you see this wrong? What what are you thinking? What are you thinking about trying to serve us? Raw food? We're here to judge this thing. We're watching you cook. We're not idiots. You know, if it were me, this is not a elimination round. I would send you home now. This is a serious cooking competition with a serious prize. Don't come in here and waste our time because he will throw you out of this competition if you do something as stupid, it's to serve as raw, unsanitary food. Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, you don't have to eat it really, you don't. I'm a judge here, so why don't you let me figure out what I have to do and what I don't have to do? I know how to do my job.

Guest Host Jennifer Lawrence Surprises People on Hollywood Blvd.
https://youtu.be/CeKMHBOU6Jk","I'm excited to be hosting a talk show on Hollywood Blvd. I've always dreamed of working 3 Doors Down from a wetzel's pretzels. But I have to admit I'm a little on edge after I saw this KTLA news report from right outside this fairy theater. It's the case of the $25,000 herpes sore, and it could happen to you. For the record, I've never had to pay for herpes, and if I did, it would kill me 'cause I'm cheap and a hypochondriac. Despite the threat of high priced herpes, I wanted to mingle with some of the locals. While I was here in Hollywood. So I came up with a simple game. I ran up to people on the street and asked them to name 5 movies. I've been in simple. If you have low enough self-esteem, the point was to put them on the spot and humiliate myself. And guess what both happened. Can you please no no. Who is the Jennifer Lawrence? Touch with you in front of me I can't. Can you name 5 Jennifer Lawrence movies? Oh gosh. Please lady, for the love of God. I know, I know, I know, I I. I'm thinking no, no, no, you did you see that movie? No, no, I didn't see it. Do you know who Jennifer Lawrence is? This is the worst day of my life for Lawrence. Hey hey, what's up? What's up? Do you smoke weed sometimes? Yeah yeah. When you smoke weed do you ever watch Jennifer Lawrence movies? No cool. Can you name 5 Jennifer Lawrence movies? 5 Jennifer Lawrence movies. No. Who is that? Right, Jennifer Aniston is way better than Jennifer Lawrence. Do you agree, yeah. Prettier, funnier yeah yeah, better movies yeah yeah yeah yeah overall yeah great I'm Jennifer Lawrence. Can you name 5 Jennifer Lawrence movies? Gosh, the one we got the woman who's one word? Kind of like happy. 1.1 word joy yes. American Hustle. Larger. Hungry, hungry hungry. I was in one of those, definitely. The blue you were like the blue yeah yeah yeah and Avengers excellent yeah yeah there's a space wine. Yeah there was a space one the hot guy yeah it's the coldest season of the year.

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","Special counsel John Durham dropping a bombshell that could lead right back to Hillary Clinton. A court filing alleges multiple Clinton campaign staffers hired a technology company to quote infiltrate servers at Trump Tower and then later the actual White House in order to try to establish a link from Donald Trump to Russia and breaking this afternoon, sources telling Fox News that Durham's probe has accelerated with more people cooperating and coming before a grand jury. Republicans say it is proof they've been right all along and that heads should start. Rolling this is what's so egregious and so wrong about it. I mean you you think about they spied on a presidential campaign that's as wrong as it gets. But then we found out from this filing that they actually spied on this sitting president, which is even worse. I would expect there to be, frankly, quite a few more indictments. I think this conspiracy, and I do think there was a criminal conspiracy. Is is broad and deep and after endless coverage of the Russia investigation, the media seems to be silent on this particular development and the way they cover the German investigation in the past is drawing even more scrutiny. The biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign. They spied on my campaign. No real evidence of that. Of course, there is no over the place. Leslie Spider my campaign, and they got called Donald Trump and William Barr promised that Durham would expose huge corruption, but he hasn't done that is apparently an ongoing concerted Republican and Pro Trump project. To try to turn the investigation of the Russia scandal into some kind of scandal itself. Oh no. OK wait till the Doomer report comes out and and then nothing happens and they just move on to the next conspiracy theory. I could just keep watching that montage, but we still take it around the table. Judge what about this development that Fox News is reporting that there is additional cooperation that's happening. Which is why this is speed up a little bit. Well, that makes sense in a situation like this. I think you know everyone who is a potential defendant knows who they are. In these cases, and they are probably recognizing that they've got into the guts of this look. This was an attempt to frame a presidential candidate and the President of the United States to frame him as being a Russian operative, a Putin puppet, and if you recall, the damage here is unbelievable. We've never seen anything like this, and America was torn for four years. We were at each other's throats because Hillary Clinton her campaign hired people to try to. Or make a connection between the server and the Trump Tower and one at a Russian bank that's connected to Putin. I mean, this is outrageous. And you know this woman who's always smiling and and you know is like you know I'm I'm the Donald Trump is evil and I am the great salvation. The truth is she's been through more criminal quasi criminal activities, from erasing 33,000 emails that many of them classified saying she never had a classified email on her laptop. For her iPhone, when that's when she was the Secretary of State and she's got all of these problems and now they're getting to the guts of it. And I think by trying to frame the President of the United States, every American should be furious. And every potential defendant out there knows that they're coming for you. And does that include? I would assume Hillary Clinton Harold, who is going to be one of the speakers at the New York State Democratic Convention and has flirted with the idea of running again. This seems to lead right back up to her door. In 2016, she put out a tweet saying oh why I look at this. There seems to be a connection here, but it seems like they were fabricating the connection in the 1st place to drive news coverage. If these allegations by Mr. Durham turn out to be true, the ones that have been leveled against, I believe these two lawyers and maybe even a third lawyer. You have to let the chips fall where they may fall. I'm a rule of law person, and I believe the Constitution, all our rule of law derives from that. I'd be careful to before we go so far, so link her to this and I've heard some people inflate the rhetoric and said, you know, quite between Watergate and here. But remember, President Nixon approved and actively engaged in a coverup. If that is proven, judge or for anybody around the table. Anybody watching? Mrs. Clinton will have a lot to answer for before we go there and make that leap with her. I think what we have on the table alone is is disturbing, so you're saying it's Obama who's behind this. I'm saying did the three, the two or three lawyers that Mr. Durham has leveled these charges with and said they went out and perhaps hired someone to infiltrate. Then candidate Trump servers that should disturb any American. Any of us who believe in the rule of law and any believe that politics should be litigated on the up and up. If that is proven again let the chips fall where they may. You know one of the reasons they figured this out. Greg is because lawyers Bill for their time and when you go back through the billing records you find out that they were all billing it to the Trump Hillary campaign. Amazing, this is worse than January six 911 Watergate Hindenburg combined. That's what CNN would say if this in fact were Trump and not Hillary. In this case, they are focusing instead on Joe Rogan, claiming that his use of the N word was another January 6th. This is another illustration of the news. Spigot, like when with Mueller the the the the legacy media can turn that spigot up full. It just blasted 24/7. Then the Hunter laptop turn the spigot off. Everybody is like what happened. Where'd it go? Biden wins an election you don't hear about Hunter Biden. Then Trump flushes paper down the toilet spigot comes up and it's hits you in the face. And now you got this collusion. You got real authentic Russian collusion hunt. This is all about Hillary, and the spigot goes off. This is something that you know. We see this every day. You saw it look they're cute it also. They blame you for the things that they do, so it is like you know you're you're putting kids in danger while they don't wear the masks, they accuse you of racism while saying that you know the toxicity. Toxicity of whiteness is everywhere, and in this case they created a hoax when in fact they were behind the hoax, creating a different hoax. Yeah, in order to drive new news coverage, yes. But then everybody would follow. Interestingly, that Mark Elias is this attorney that everyone should pay attention to democratic Marc? Elias, perhaps? You know Democrats are even mad at him because of screwing up the Arizona case. So when you hear cooperation, it sort of means to me that some people just don't wanna go to jail. So they started talking. I think Hillary should be banished from polite society. I'm not comparing her to OJ because, you know, we have no proof that she ever murdered anybody. But I would like to see Hillary treated the way OJ is. You know, he's not really welcome places. He's kind of a pariah right now. She is a certified political criminal. Her husband has been me too D. Then figured to be on Epstein's island and you know the foundation was, you know that's just like a washed up money laundering operation. This is what happened. She paid people to hack into Trump's computers and frame him for being a Russian traitor. That would be like paying someone to break into Trump Tower 2:00 o'clock in the morning. Plan a bunch of guns and drugs and Russian documents, and then call the FBI and said, hey guys, I gotta tip. Once you go raid the tower, that's the same thing. And we now know too that this was happening as far back as 2014. The CIA knew crooked was trying to frame them. They briefed Obama that Hillary was gonna frame him. They briefed the FBI that this was a frame job. So Mueller was just a clean up operation to tee up the impeachment and it failed so. It's not. I think you know Greg was being facetious, I think, but when you look at January 6th and then you look at this, what did more damage? I mean, think about how many people's lives were destroyed, how it divided the country, how it made us question, our democracy question, the election, and our institutions. It ruined multiple Thanksgivings for me personally, and you know, I think we need to get to the bottom of it. As they say, Greg, Big if true, yes, big. Know who else worked you who worked on the Watergate? Committee remember Hillary herself. That's right, right full circle as they say, and a lot of people want Hillary investigated, not just Republicans and Democrats. Yeah, not just independents, Democrats. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJVrEHWCzU,Inside Angelina Jolie's Current Relationship With Her Brother,"Siblings Angelina Jolie and James Haven Voight have never lacked for sparks in their relationship. Whether it was kissing each other at an Oscars afterparty in 2000, living under the same roof in the early 2010's, or seeming to be borderline estranged at the time of this video, you can always depend on this relationship being eventful and emotionally loaded. Having lost their mother, Marcheline Bertrand, to cancer, and endured a rollercoaster relationship with their father, Jon Voight, there sure are plenty of reasons for Haven and Jolie to lean on each other when the times get tough. But just how far they leaned remains a matter of speculation. Here's the truth about Angelina Jolie's relationship with her brother.

Jolie knows how to get people talking, but remember when she kissed her brother on the mouth or going deep on the bond between Angelina and James Haven. Speaking with the Daily Mail in 2007, James Haven revealed just how difficult his father actor Jon Voight had been to deal with, recalling that when he was 13 and Angelina was 11. You're tasked with confronting him about alimony. He said there were times when our dad was awesomely good with us, but he would look more to our faults than to our strengths. So when the pair lost their mother, Marceline, but ran to cancer in 2007, their bond only strengthened Haven said I couldn't stop crying. Fortunately, I was with Angie when we heard I go to Angie for advice and won't do anything without her because we were so close as children Haven and Jolie became so close, in fact, that the actor tattooed the letter. H on her wrist. In honor of her brother when she married Brad Pitt back in 2014, Jolie told People I also wore a little flower ring that was my mom's and Jamie Warren Angel pin from her jewelry box. Julie and Jon Voight have a complicated relationship, and in 2002 she appeared to cut ties with him completely. At the time, she told Access Hollywood it's not healthy for me to be around my father. I will only say that like every child, James and I would have loved to have had. A warm and loving relationship with our dad in 2007, Haven told the Daily Mail that he had pulled away from their dad too, but everything changed. Two years later, when Haven became a born again Christian as he rebuilt his relationship with Voight, he encouraged his sister to do the same. According to Eve, she resisted initially, but with a push from Haven and then husband Pitt, Jolie eventually forgave her dad by February 2010. E spotted Jolie Pitt and their six kids sightseeing in Venice. With none other than their previously estranged grandfather, as one source told the outlet, the visit actually went really well, and Angie thrilled he got on really well with all her kids for giving. John is a huge step. It was the year 2000 and a 24 year old Jolie had just won the best supporting actress Oscar for Girl interrupted when she made a surprising declaration of love on stage, stating I am so in love with my brother. You are the strongest, most amazing man. I've ever known and I love you. Then the siblings shared a kiss on the lips at the Vanity Fair after party, immediately sparking a media frenzy. But while many found the whole thing a little strange, Julie explained via the New York Post, James and I were each other. Everything always, and we've been best friends. Meanwhile, a family friend told Radar Online that there was meaning behind the smooch, revealing the day. Angelina kissed Jamie at the Oscars. It was the first day their mother, Marceline. Was treated for cancer. They left the hospital together and got ready together. It was meant to be here we are. They only ever had each other after Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in 2016, her brother quickly swooped in to offer support, moving into his sister's rented Malibu home to help look after her children, Haven became their full-time. Many with Grazia noting it was his job to be there. If any of the kids woke up during the night and to deal with the other nannies if they had any issues. He was virtually running the household. I'm not alone managing everything, but Haven strong bond with his nieces and nephews was nothing new according to Daily Mail, which previously spotted him taking the kids on outings to the park. But the good vibes appeared to take a nosedive in 2017 when Jolie seemingly fired her brother from the gig. With outlets reporting that Haven was allegedly working under toxic conditions, a source for new idea, claimed James insists. Angelina ruined his life. And since they went from being best friends to enemies overnight, she sacked him from being her head nanny and they've barely spoken since. So what was really going on behind the scenes? It's unclear at what moment Jolie seemingly unbreakable bond with her brother began to disintegrate, but one inside her alleged to the Daily Mail in January 2021, Angelina and James are widely believed to have drifted apart some years ago. According to the outlet, it's unclear what transpired between the siblings who had previously. Last over each other nonstop, the source further claimed he does his thing. She does hers, and while they may be cordial from a distance, you certainly don't see or hear of them being together. It's sad and the situation doesn't look like it's changing anytime soon. Following his mysterious falling out with Julie Haven stepped out of the spotlight and pretty much disappeared. He wasn't spotted until January 2021, when the Daily Mail reported that he was living with his longtime girlfriend, Ashley Rayne. At her home in Canoga Park, CA. It's unclear what Haven has been doing for work since the abrupt end of his gig as many, but as the outlet noted, he's allegedly entitled to 10% of his sisters earnings thanks to a deal struck by their late mother. But even if the rumors are true, Haven doesn't appear to be living the high life. According to one eyewitness, his current living situation is less than desirable, but maybe that's just compared to his sister. Check out one of our newest videos right here.

Kevin Finds ""The Fountain Of Youth"" Through Face Yoga With KOKO | Shark Tank Global
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCREgA-BmOocJ9Is_bZV6aJQ","Next up is what the entrepreneur believes is like a fountain of youth. Wow, great offer. Hi sharks, my name is Coco. I am asking 200,000 for 20% of the company. In this day and age, appearance is everything. Sharks, what if I told you could look 10 years younger without any plastic surgery or injection? I have found the fountain of youth because I am. 61 years old. Believable, seriously, I hate you. I'm 40 years old. I was like what about five bids right there? Oh my God, my business is face yoga, face yoga. It's a really great natural solution to regain your youthful at Terrance. We wake up sleeping muscle in the face to lift up your face and relax those overacting muscle for wrinkle reduction. So Kevin let's see your face as you look great. But if you do face yoga exercises, you can look like this. Right? This is great, but you feel don't do any exercise. You can look like this just in a couple. That's brutal, there is no way I'm going to look like that. That didn't happen. I'm serious, I know I'm a face yoga expert, so would you like to come up here so that I can make you look 10 years younger? Yeah, sure, some exercises together. OK, thank you. Please stand here. Thank you to prevent or reduce double chin up and then stretch your neck. Then stick out your chin to the ceiling like. How do you feeling and then? You look like a seal. You literally look like a seal. I feel younger. Last one, let's lift up the corners of the mouth a little bit higher, smile and then stick out your tongue. Dad, this is not so easy. Show me Coco dishes not easy. Thank you Coco question. Yes, how many hours a day do you do this in general three to five minutes per day only? Because once you learn how to do those exercises you can do when you're driving, walking, dog, walking on computer. It's easy to continue Coco. How many students do you have? I have taught more than 200 people. I trust $200. Girl one hour session but Coco I'm confused it takes 5 minutes So what are you doing with the other 55 minutes? Here's how to do some specific exercises in detail, like the training seminar. Yes, it's personalized in Japan. Face exercise has been very, very popular over a decade, so there are many schools, teachers, lots of things going on Coco. How are you acquiring your customers? One of my exciting revenue stream is licensing the method to other instructors. Have you done that already or I have two instructors next to me, but I would like to really scale more. Are you making any money? According to you? This is $1,000,000 idea right? Yes, my lifetime sales is only 17,000. But with my instructor we can do more bigger business if you think about the beauty market photos. Funeral facelift necklift $14 billion market in the world. So you think you're going to compete with that head on? Yes, in Japan how popular is face yoga in Japan? More than 800 instructors face yoga instructors. It's a big business. It's a big business. How big is it in dollars in Japan? I believe 10s of 1,000,000 in Japan but in Japanese population is 1/3 of Americans. So we can be bigger too. I have another cosmetic business from Japan which currently make a half million annual sales and so that's how you're living. Yes, you have one business doing half $1,000,000. You have the other business doing $17,000. Shouldn't you maybe be focusing on the business that's making you money? That's a good question, but I. Oh, I'm entrepreneur. I always love doing something new and this is really my passion as well. That cosmetics business is for actually senior market like 60s Seventies, 80s, more mature audience like you got because that hero product is soap. To eliminate aging, body order, body odor, body odor associated with Asian, I want to know what your next business is watching #3 if I give you 200,000. Do I get a piece of the ageing body odor business too? So it's a separate compact separate business? Coco let me just say you're amazing. Anybody who can get $17,000 from people for face stretching. You deserve a lot of credit. There's no easy way to say this, but it's just not a fit for me. I'm out Coco. Thank you. Go go go. I admire your energy second to none you came bouncing through that but I can't wrap my head around unfortunately I'm out. You are remarkably entertaining, truly. I firmly believe that you'd be hugely successful if you did a comedy routine. But on this business I'm out. Coco, I think that in the American market people like things fast. I think that in the American culture I don't think people will spend all that time a day doing it for their face. I think they'd go get fillers and boom, it's over. No natural way affordable than those. I get it. I get it, but I just don't see this working well for me. I'm sorry I'm up. Thank you look, I did the exercises. I feel about 20 minutes younger. What I love about Shark Tank is I learned something every day every day and I've learned about the aging old people odor. That's a real science, Coco. You're you're wonderful energy. I love it. But this face yoga thing is really hard to make money off it. It's just you're not worth $1,000,000. I'm just trying to be pragmatic about it. I'm out Coco. Thank you very much for congratulations. Flap. I hate to see her go. She's back of that dress. That's crazy. It's not addressing. I will be laughing at them when I become very very successful. And if they come to me at that time, oh Google. Please teach me some exercise. No, I will not teach them any exercise so please leave with your saggy face."

Wow, we've grown from 0 to $750,000 in annual recurring revenue. What's your own personal background? My dad came to the states from South Korea to study engineering. My mom worked at Dunkin' Donuts to support him and I was born and then they went back to South Korea for a job. When I was 14, I decided to come to the states by myself to study at a boarding school in Portland, OR, but I went to Duke for my undergrad where I double majored in economics and Chinese and my first job out of college was an investment banking. One day I had a business idea that I wanted to pursue, so I quit that job. And that's how I started my previous startup. What was it? It was a software business called Lock it. And what happened to that company? So we sold the company a few years ago after selling the company, I went to Stanford Business School and it was there. I started working on simple hang on.

So how many people are doing the subscription service over 5000 subscribers as of today? Do you have a main competitor? Yeah, there are meditation apps out there, and in fact This is why I started the business. Because most of the apps out there only have one teacher and it's all that his or her voice and after a while you start to tune out. So you're creating a collection of vast amount and that's your differentiate. We're a marketplace for teachers and students where where you profitable where you losing money in the first year? We've been losing money even now because profitability is not our main component. When would you expect to be profitable? They're nice, so we're expected to be doing over $5 million next year. How much money did you raise? We've raised about $2.8 million what? Wow? 2.8 million? Yeah, for what percentage round was at $12 million valuation cap. We use convertible notes. How much of the two point 8,000,000 is left? We have most of it in the bank today. We have about over 2.3. Why do you need the 600,000 from us? For I'm here because I think that you guys can add so much value to us. So where you know if you think we can add so much value? Why are you valuing our contributions as the exact same? As any other investor in this note. Because that note was from many months before, when we had much less revenue, we didn't even have half of our team."

Zee News Apps : https://bit.ly/ZeeNewsApps","The drumbeats of war are getting louder in Ukraine. America says invasion is imminent. Russia could strike any moment, but the European partners are more skeptical. They're still betting on diplomacy. It's just like last week the crisis is taking dual tracks, diplomacy and deterrence. Let's talk about diplomacy first on Saturday, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin had more complaints, Biden had more warnings. In the end, there was no breakthrough. The next day, Biden dial Ukraine, president, followed the mere zelenski he briefed him on the Putin phone call. What happened next is interesting. Kiev says Dolinsky invited Biden to Ukraine. Sort of like a morale booster. Washington, though made no mention of this invite. They completely ignored it and you can understand why the United States is drumming up panic there, Media says. Russia will invade this Wednesday. The White House says it's just a matter of time. Said before we are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time. Should Vladimir Putin decide to order it? I will not comment on the details of our intelligence information, but I do want to be clear it could begin during the Olympics. Why has America turned alarmist? Maybe they haven't. Maybe this is all part of Western propaganda. Pressurized Putin to show his hand. Whatever the reason, panic is now spreading around a dozen nations are asking their citizens to leave Ukraine. This includes Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, Australia and Japan Airlines are also avoiding Ukraine, Dutch, Dutch, carrier, KLM has canceled flights to Kiev. Germany's Lufthansa is considering the same. And these are not good signs for Ukraine. Foreigners fleeing your country flights, avoiding your airspace. All of this usually means only one thing. War is imminent, but Ukraine wants to keep the morale high. They're not buying America's panic, which is why Vilenski invited Biden to Kiev. It would have sent a strong message to Putin instead. Another Western leader landed in Kiev today and let me add, not a popular one. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. His reluctance to take on Russia has enraged Ukrainians. He's refused to send military aid. He's non committal on canceling Nord Stream 2 the gas pipeline. So this visit was always going to be tough. Scholes had to prove himself to two groups to his western partners and to the Ukrainian people. Their anger was perfectly summed up by this tweet. It was written by Ukraine's envoy to Germany. The title is perfect German hypocrisy. He says. Berlin exports goods worth 366 million euros to Russia, but they have given 0 military aid for Ukraine. Unless you count the helmets. How does Scholes plan to change this dynamic with the same broken record sanctions? Services North Wendy Clark. Suzanne Clark. It's necessary to be clear to say clearly that in the case of military aggression against Ukraine that endangers its territorial integrity and sovereignty will result in hard reactions and sanctions that we have carefully prepared and that we can put into effect immediately together with our allies in Europe and NATO. Nope. With allies like Germany, you have no option but to prepare for war, and that's what Ukraine is doing. President Zelensky has reiterated his bid to join the NATO. He says it is the only way Ukraine can secure itself. Germany, on the other hand, wants talks. Chancellor Schultz says he's willing to discuss European security with Vladimir Putin. That's where he's heading next to Moscow on Sunday. A new shipment of military aid arrived in Kiev. Guess what's inside those boxes. Stinger antiaircraft missiles. It's an insurgent staple. You can take out enemy jets with precision. Stingers have changed the tide in many wars. The best example is Afghanistan, a country many Ukrainians talk about. Nowadays. They think the situations are similar. In Afghanistan, the army outnumbered the Taliban. The army had better weapons than the Taliban. Same in Ukraine. Russia has more soldiers. Russia has better weapons, but if the disorganized Taliban could beat the US backed army, surely Ukraine's army can beat the Russians. That's what people in Kiev say, they're bullish. But it's a tall ask frankly, across the border, the Russian war machine continues to mobilize in Belarus. The military drills are expanding Russian and Belarus in fighter jets were patrolling the skies down below. Tanks conducted firing drills. So ground and air covered. What about the waters that's happening further South Russian warships have already reached Crimea on Sunday. A Russian submarine also arrived put together around 30. Russian vessels are parked in the Black Sea, enough for a full scale naval blockade. Despite all of this buildup, all this posturing Russia continues to deny any plan to invade, so Kiev is asking for clarity. And they have triggered a special European Security pact. It's called the OSC. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia has also signed this pact. It's a signatory. The OSC has a special clause on clarity. Suppose a European country is moving its troops or conducting military drills. Other nations can demand answers. Basically they can ask them what are you up to. And Ukraine has now triggered this clothes. They want a meeting with Russia within 48 hours, but Moscow has refused to attend. This conflict is not just playing out in Ukraine, by the way. It's also playing out in the at the United Nations. It's playing out at the Olympics. It will also play out at the Munich Security Conference this week they call it Davos for defense. It's being held since 1963, but this year Russia is not participating at the Olympics. All the controversies about this athlete. Russian figure skater Camille Valeeva. Before the games began, she submitted her samples for testing, but the results came out only on the 8th of February after she had completed her event. It turned out that she had failed the dope test. A Court of Arbitration was hastily put together and valley Eva. Was cleared to compete. Why wasn't she disqualified? Because she's a minor. the United States has expressed disappointment over the verdict. They're planning legal action themselves now on the face of it, this is a totally unrelated incident. A military buildup near Ukraine and a doping scandal in Beijing. But that's how cold wars work, you see. There's no fighting on the ground, so the rivalry has to play out somewhere. It plays out in culture in politics, sports, movies. Even if the standoff is resolved, the animosity between the West and Russia is here to stay. We on is now available in your country.

Think in the last. Maybe six months, eight months. There has been a growing sense of despondency, I would say. I mean when I sit at home and talk to Kiran, you know Kiran and I? Have lived all our lives in India for the first time. Kiran says, should we move out of India now that's a disastrous and very big statement for Kiran to make to me. She feels for her child. She feels for, you know, with this. Atmosphere around us will be. She feels scared to open the newspapers every day. So that that does indicate that there is a sense of growing disquiet. It's a sense of growing despondency apart from alarm. There's one one. Part of it is alarm, there's another part you feel. Depressed, you know you feel low, you feel you know why this is happening. So that sense does exist in me to be quite honest."

It was a coordinated plan to intimidate India. British ships were target India's western Coast Americans would make a dash in the Bay of Bengal to counter this multidimensional threat. New Delhi sent out an SOS call. It urged global powers for support and there was only one country that listened. The Soviet Union.

They encircled American and British warships, stopped them from entering India's territorial waters, and prevented a direct clash between India and the US. UK combined. Moscow was a reliable partner for New Delhi when no one else was, as Washington consistently ignored India's concerns and sided with Pakistan. Today. The story from 1971 maybe a little more than a fond memory, but its geopolitical underpinning still remain intact. Yes, there have been some minor hiccups and interruptions, but Moscow remains one of India's most dependable partners and this week this partnership will enter its next phase. Hello and welcome to Gravitas Plus ample kishar mouse pad. On the 6th of December, India will receive a rather special guest. The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin. The visit is important. It's symbolism cannot be downplayed. This is the second time President Putin is stepping out of Russia this year. The first was in June to meet you as President Biden in Geneva, and since then he skipped visits to the G20. The climate summit in Glasgow and rescheduled his tour of China. He will now come to India first. This indicates Russia's abiding interest in its relationship with India, a relationship that has withstood the test of time and geopolitical churns. It helps to begin with history. It's hard to put a date, but India and Russia have known each other for centuries all the way back to the 4th century. Russia used to be a transit trade route between Europe and India. Indian merchants would frequently visit Moscow. Ashkan and Saint Petersburg Russian travelers would visit Indian cities, document the culture and people in their tails. In the 18th century Russia last training, Empress Catherine the Great published the first Russian translation of the Bhagavad Gita in the 19th century, Russian Tsar Paul, the first planned to invade British India to weaken the British Empire. Bizarre was assassinated. The plan was cancelled. Now for most of modern history relations between India and Russia remain tepid even after the creation of the Soviet Union in 1922, and this is largely because Stalin did not think very highly of India or should I say, the leaders of India. Independence movement, he thought of them as quote UN quote running dogs of imperialism. As tools of British and capitalist forces, he considered Mahatma Gandhi and Evil Nehru as agents of Counter revolutionary forces. A staunch Communist revolutionary stallion viewed their fight for independence as a conspiracy of the bourgeoisie aimed at keeping monopoly capitalism alive. So in 1947, when India became independent, Stalin reacted with open hostility, something he maintained till his death in 1953. India Russia relations remained cold until then. The ice broke in 1955 under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. He visited India that year and laid the foundation of an economic partnership and for the next six years, Russia embarked on what they called E Allen Isation, a process which brought India closer to Russia. Moscow upheld Indian sovereignty in Kashmir also over Goa, which used to be a Portuguese enclave. Around the same time a rift emerged between China and Russia, the Chinese began viewing the Soviets with suspicion. They regarded Khrushchev's policies as a revisionist version of communism. Mall decided to disengage with Moscow. So it came as no surprise that in 1962 when India went to war with China, the Soviet Union maintained neutrality and by doing so it exceeded expectations. It was never meant to meet. Moscow's refusal to back China was extremely significant. India began placing more trust in Russia. In 1970, when India conducted its first nuclear test, Washington was critical. It lectured India. In contrast, Moscow stressed on the peaceful nature of the test. And in their responded in kind when the world slammed Moscow over its involvement in Hungary and the Czech Republic. India remained quiet even after the Soviet Union disintegrated. Bilateral ties did not suffer. Yes, there were some ups and downs, but at the end of the day, the logic of geopolitics prevailed. Today it manifests itself in every sphere. Take economy, for instance, bilateral trade between India and Russia stands at $8.1 billion in and exports amount to $2.6 billion. Russian imports are at 5.48 billion by 2025. They plan to take bilateral trade to $25 billion. In politics, both India and Russia collaborate at platforms like the UN, G20, BRICS and SCO. In fact, it's often said that Russia brought India into the SCO, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, in a bid to counter China. Then we come to defence. India is the second largest market for the Russian defense industry. Russia accounts for 68% of India's military hardware import followed by the United States and Israel. The Indo Russian Intergovernmental Commission is one of the largest and most comprehensive governmental mechanisms that India has with any country. Almost every department from the Government of India attends it. India's foreign secretary recently stated that without Russian spare parts, our ships won't sail and our planes won't fly together. India and Russia have launched several joint military programs. Programs to develop state of the art weapons like the Brahmos, cruise missile, the so-called fighter jet, the illusion transport aircraft and the car move twin engine helicopters. India has also purchased and leased all kinds of military hardware from Russia, like the T 90s, Bhishma battletank, the Akula 2 nuclear submarine, the INS Vikramaditya and how could we not mention the S 400 triumph? The biggest bone of contention right now between India and the USY is that you see in 2018, India struck a $5.5 billion. Deal with Russia to buy the S 400 air defense system. The first unit is expected to be operational by the end of the year. What is the S 401 of the most advanced and potent air defense systems in the world? It has the potential of repelling almost all sorts of aerial attacks. India needs the S 400 in order to protect itself from the growing threats from China and Pakistan. So why is the US upset? Well, multiple reasons. One, the US wants India to end its reliance on Russian weapons. More importantly, in 2017, the US Congress passed a law called Catsa Countering America's adversaries through Sanctions Act. Gatza the aim of this law was to counter American adversaries like Iran, Russia and North Korea. Also to sanction the countries who deal with them. In 2020 the US imposed sanctions on Turkey. Its longstanding NATO ally, because Turkey bought the S 400 from Russia. In January this year, a US Congressional report warned that if India buys the S 400, it will be sanctioned 2. And despite the pressure, India went ahead with the deal. Reports say India will get a waiver on Catsa A1 time exception. Now these are just reports. The fact is that the US cannot afford to sanction a strategic partner and a major market like India. The S 400 deal is expected to feature in the talks between Prime Minister Modi and President Putin. Here's another subject. They cannot miss China. You see, Russia's perception of in relationship with China is changing. Moscow may not admit it, but there's a growing asymmetry in its ties with Beijing. At the same time, Russia's economic dependence of China is the highest ever. China is increasingly gaining an upper hand over Russia. It is overshadowing Russian investments in Central Asia. It is diluting Moscow's economic and military institutions diminishing its importance as the most potent communist force. Simply put, Russia's dominance is beginning to erode in the face of China's growing belligerence. And it is aware of this weakening position, but has decided to deal with it rather carefully with ice cream diplomacy, even the circumstances compel Russia to do so. China remains its best bet in countering the US, so picking a fight with Beijing does not help. As for India, Russia suspects that India could move closer to the US orbit into the US orbit, especially after the formation of the quad. Which it perceives as a threat to its own interests. Simply put, Russia sees itself in a state of siege. China is growing ambitions and America's ever expanding alliances are challenging Moscow. At a time like this, Russia wants to reassure itself if it can still regard India as a friend and not just as a defense customer. So when Vladimir Putin comes to New Delhi, his aim will be. Not just to sustain the traditional ties, but further deepen bilateral partnership draw the nations together and choke out a path for a shared future."

Gathered in Lahore and the situation very quickly turned violent. Alright, so this is what the scene was when members of the Terry Kalabat party, which has now been banned officially in Pakistan. It can't fight elections, it can't win any seats. And Members of this party they took over the streets in the city of Lahore and there are also reports that there was a car that tried to ram through the security offices, resulting in death at least about three people so far. And many others have been wounded. And also there were clashes between members of Derek in the Back Pakistan Party and the forces which led to further injuries to many people who are taking part in the protests. The police resorted to firing teargas in defence. But the TLP officials alleged that the security forces resorted to heavy handed means in dealing with they described as peaceful protesters. With violent clashes, have come after negotiations between the authorities and the band group broke down. The protestors gathered to demand two things first. Firstly, the release of Saad Hussain Rizvi, who happens to be the leader of the TLP group, and secondly the expulsion of the French ambassador over cartoons that depict Prophet Mohammed in a very poor lied. The protester and the demonstrators accused the sitting Prime Minister Imran Khan. For his bullying tactics with the protesters Lisbon towards the protesters had to say. I thought about you. For money. We we got it. Yeah. Try again. Carrie, I mean. But the main route from and to Lahore and Islamabad have been blocked with shipping containers to prevent the demonstrators from leaving. Authorities have even suspended cellular service, but the TLP party has warned of a Plan B if the authorities were to stop them from entering into the capital city. Terry KBK Pakistan Chiefs address we remember was arrested in the month of April. Earlier this year he was first detained for a period of three months and then again under the Anti Terror Act, the 27 year. Bold leader, who is a very vocal supporter of many controversial laws, including the blasphemy law, was detained further by the Pakistan Security forces. Now more protests that could turn violent are expected later in the day today, because if a federal review board is scheduled to take up the government reference against him. Now remember, just seven months ago there were similar clashes that had broken out across Pakistan. Many people gathered to protest. Or were a series of cartoons that depicted Prophet Muhammad in very poor light, so the cartoons that depicted the prophet with a turban with a bomb tide to it that were published in France and at least about 5 policemen and three actors were killed in the protests that took place in Pakistan, at least about 1000 people were injured. But the caricatures were published in the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo last year. The articles included pieces on far right governments and other religions as well, and these people in Pakistan who are protesting are demanding for the immediate expulsion of the French ambassador from Pakistan and also a boycott of all French made goods in Pakistan.

So the United Kingdom has raised alarm over Poland security situation naturally. The reason I'm here is because Poland is absolutely critical to our collective European security and the lesson of the last 100 years is that when Poland is threatened with instability or aggression on the borders of Poland, then we are all threatened. The Kremlin has constantly maintained that it has no plans to invade the foreign minister. Sergey Lavrov says that it is the West which is seeking to provoke the conflict. But the West has posed appointment question to Moscow. Why has it amassed its military surrounding Ukraine? Prime Minister Johnson noted that there will be bloodshed and disaster if Russia chooses to invade Ukraine.

They don't think it's right. One of the most common arguments you hear is how do I explain this to my kids? And it's a good question. At the very least, it's a fair question. You wonder if children are sophisticated enough to wrap their head around something like this. So we went out on the street today to ask kids what they think and what they know. And here they are. Kids share their thoughts on same sex marriage. Could you tell me what gay marriage is? One two men and two women get married. So is it when four people get married, no. Could you tell us what gay marriage is? I know nothing about that yet. You don't know anything about it. Why would anyone want to get married? Because they love each other and they just feel a connection. Do you think it's a good thing? Yeah, do you know what makes somebody gay? I got broken leg. When should two people get married? Afternoon. That's a good time to get married. Do you know what marriage is? What is it? Husband and wife get married. So what do you think gay marriage is? Will I get married in a girl and a girl get married? Oh you're right, do you think that's very hard to understand? For some kids, but not for you, not really. Do you think anybody should be able to get married? If you're old enough. Very wise do you want to get married? Yes, when. One on 30. Everyone want to get married. Because they're pregnant. Could you tell us what gay marriage is? Dumb. Where boy marries another boy. OK, and could it be when a girl meets or marries another girl? No just love boy meeting another boy. Wow what would it be called if a girl married another girl? Lesbianism. Anybody should be able to get married if they want to. Yes, how come? Well, because if they want to, they should be able to. Would you want to get married? Really. How come? Because when you get married, the other person is entitled entitled to any money on the other person has social financial issue for you, yeah? He's crystal is conservative. Hi, I'm Jimmy Kimmel. Thanks for watching if you'd like to see more, click below to subscribe to our YouTube channel. And if not, do nothing at all."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooyrmqanNrE,Why Hollywood Can't Stand Tom Cruise,"For a time, Tom Cruise was arguably the most recognizable and loved leading man in Hollywood. He starred in some of the most memorable movies of the '80s and '90s, including Risky Business, Top Gun, and the Mission: Impossible franchise. But over the years, Cruise’s star power and relationship with the public has taken a hit. He isn't the go-to leading man in Hollywood anymore but is now often the butt of jokes and viral video fails.

Is it all just jealousy or is the blame really on Cruise and his behavior? This is why Hollywood can't stand Tom Cruise anymore.

Read Full Article: http://www.nickiswift.com/34655/tom-cruise-became-hated-hollywood/","Over the course of more than 35 years, Tom Cruise has the fall from a teen heartthrob to one of the most powerful and polarizing figures in Hollywood. He flew straight into the hearts of women everywhere. His maverick in Top Gun, and he won the male vote as Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible building a reputation as one of the film industry's genuine mega stars. But somewhere along the way, the love Cruise had grown accustomed to began to fade, and the public's perception of him changed drastically. Once the man that every guy wanted to be and every girl wanted to be with the name Tom Cruise has since come to mean something completely different. Cruise control as variety reports, cruises. Reboot of the Mummy is the latest of his films to be negatively impacted by his controlling interference according to insiders, Cruise revamped the entire script and heavily influenced the direction, editing and even marketing of the film, which produced a relatively dismal $32 million domestic opening weekend. International returns have been better, though insiders filled out the film will recoup its combined production and marketing costs, and the mummy wasn't the first film tainted by cruises. Obsessive meddling. According to actor R Lee Ermey. Collaborator and friend of the late director Stanley Kubrick. The failure of eyes wide Shut was also due to the stars ego tripping army told Radar Online that Kubrick was disgusted with it and that the critics were going to have him for lunch. He said. Cruise and Kidman have their way with him, exactly the words he used. Fewer fangirls, telling women what they can and can't wear is one way to lose the female demographic. But telling them how to give birth is a different kind of insult entirely. When Katie Holmes is pregnant, Cruz was forced to address rumors that he was demanding his wife give birth in complete silence. A practice Scientologist believe prevents permanent. Kick scars caused by negativity at birth. According to ABC News, crews was even rumored to have had a special pacifier made to keep homes quiet during delivery, though the A Lister insisted the church is silent. Birth method isn't as strict as many believe. It wasn't the first time crew stuck his nose into the childbirth debate. He made headlines in 2005 when he openly criticized Brooke Shields for taking medication to manage postpartum depression. Shields responded by saying Tom should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who were experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them. Cruises 3rd and final strike came on his alleged onset. Infidelity was exposed rumors that Scientology bigwigs encouraged Cruise to cheat on his first wife, Mimi Rogers with second wife, Nicole Kidman on the set of days of Thunder were reportedly confirmed by former senior church executive Marty Rathbun, who set up the scheme. It just shows you how twisted and corrupted Scientology is. No studio love cruises behavior off Screen eventually began to affect his career in 2006. Paramount Pictures ended its 14 year working relationship with the actor, fearing his erratic actions. Going to negatively impact receipts for the upcoming Mission Impossible three. Apparently it wasn't just the actors affiliation with Scientology that had the studio's wedding cruises bizarre appearance on Oprah led many to question his sanity. Paramount CEO Sumner Redstone was quoted by CNN saying as much as we like him personally, we thought it was wrong to renew his deal. His recent conduct had not been acceptable to paramount total power, despite naming Cruise as one of 2016 most overpaid actors. Forbes Magazine is well aware of the influence Cruz holds. Cleaning him the most powerful actor more than once, he topped the list in 2006 after war of the world cleaned up at the box office and again in 2012 after Mission Impossible Ghost protocol brought the franchise back from the brink. While most studios strive to tap the biggest names in showbiz, when stars call the shots themselves, it becomes a problem. Cruises reputation now precedes him, but the actors had better luck cracking the increasingly lucrative Asian market. Japan crush on Cruise exploded into a full on affair after the release of 2003 is the last samurai with the country declaring October 10th. National Holiday Tom Cruise Day conversion scheme. Devoting one's life to a faith created by a science fiction writer is a personal choice, but recruiting other a list lives into the fold. Sounds a little like propaganda, former high ranking Scientologist garrymore heck told the Daily Mail that Cruz had an unhealthy obsession with David Beckham and viewed the British soccer star as the ideal convert. That conversation never came to pass, but it allegedly wasn't for a lack of trying on cruises part. According to a 2015 report in an attempt to lure Beckham to Scientology headquarters, Cruise ordered Sea Org members to build the soccer field. It was all for nothing as Beckham and wife Victoria reportedly pulled a no show. Unpopular vote does Cruise really deserve to be hated in Hollywood and beyond. Some say all this negativity boils down to a simple case of jumping on the bandwagon. For every fan that harbors a genuine hate for them. And there's another who will avoid his movies based solely on the sway of public opinion. Still, the old saying there's no such thing as bad publicity rings. True gossip has followed Cruz his entire life, yet his star power has continued to prevail despite his questionable beliefs and erratic outbursts, Cruz remains in high demand, reaffirming his position as one of the industry's top leading men.

https://youtu.be/kRh1zXFKC_o","Alright, now it's time for something I don't know if this will be educational, but the president is overseas. He's visiting Belgium, England, Scotland and then his pal Putin in Finland. It's a big trip with many important ramifications. It's imperative that America has strong relationships with and knowledge about people in other lands, and that responsibility extends to all of us, not just the president.

How about a country in Africa? I know South Africa is over here somewhere, no, no it's down here. Yeah South can you name any country on this map? Yeah Africa, that's a continent. Oh God can you name any countries in Africa? God no. Who knows. Stuff like that. Can you name any country on this map? From Africa, that's a continent. Oh premium or isolate or something. Any country. Entire map. This is so horrible. Where's America? I would say this big one, but I'm probably wrong. Can you name any country on this map? Oh my gosh. Should I be taught this in school? I would hope so. South America continent. Oh my God. Having a country in South America. Yeah, Honduras is. Here, here, here, here, here, somewhere here. Can you name any country in Europe? Is this one Europe? No, this one no. Can you name a single country in Africa? Was this Africa? No? Again, not just America? No idea. Could you name a country in South America? OK, this is South America. Yes. Can you name a country in it? No, I can't. Did you go to high school? Yes. Did you go to college? Yeah, that's a sad part. Peanuts, Chile, Bolivia.

So congratulations, thank you. Congratulations to you is what I say. Thank you. So rough, alright? So you so congratulations on the wedding. It was a huge wedding. We saw pictures all of us because it was like the royal wedding or something y'all were. How long did the wedding last? How many ceremonies did you have? Well it was just three days 1 Indian ceremony and one. Western Christian ceremony and one day of prayer rituals which we have in the Hindu in the Hindu wedding. But it was not like usually Indian weddings are like 1000 people. At least we had only 200 which was mostly family with both of both of us had giant families right? What do you mean? It's usually 1000. Why wasn't 1000 then? Because I think we just wanted to keep it super intimate about just family. Super intimate, just 200 people for an Indian family and an Indian wedding for sure. That's like less. My mother was so upset with me the whole time. It was like I need to have another party for the 150,000 people that I know. How can I not invite my jeweler? How can I not invite like my hairdresser? I would say wow yeah, 'cause you have to figure out that cutoff point, especially once you get to 200 that then it's literally you might as well invite the hairdresser in the jeweler. I mean, right? Not when you have 100 people in your family. Yeah, like my dad side my mom side like their brothers, sisters, cousins, kids. It's like a whole thing, right? So there's a lot of people I have known.

How long ago did you meet? Were you a fan of the Jonas Brothers? I actually didn't know much about. I mean nobody, everyone knew the Jonas brother, right? I just didn't know the music. I didn't like. I just I knew some of the songs, but I really didn't know much about them. In fact, Nick and I both didn't know much about each other, so we did a show and tell. After we got we started dating. Where like we showed each other our works from when we were. Younger, the embarrassing stuff. Like the horrible things. Yeah, it was great. That's how we got to know each other careers.

He said that he was confident that Russian citizens would support the decision through this move. Putin has brushed off Western warnings and threats of sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized 2 breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent on Monday and ordered the Russian army to launch what Moscow called a peacekeeping operation in the area. The moves further up the ante in a crisis. The West fears could unleash a major war in a lengthy televised address, a visibly angry Putin described Ukraine as an integral part of Russia's history, calling eastern Ukraine ancient Russian land and said he was confident the Russian people. Would support his decision. We demand from those who captured and hold the power in Kiev to immediately end the combat activities. Otherwise all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime, ruling the territory of Ukraine. Putin told Russia's Defense Ministry to deploy troops into the two breakaway regions. To quote keep the peace in a decree issued shortly after he announced recognition for Russia backed separatists there. Moscow action may well torpedo a last minute bid for a summit with. As President Joe Biden aimed at preventing a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the White House on Monday said Biden strongly condemned Putin's decree while leaders in Britain, Germany, France, the United States and the EU all vowed to impose swift sanctions on Russia in response to Putin's actions. Doctor Qadir Opatija Goda is an international affairs expert and a fellow at Australia India Institute. He joins us live from Melbourne for more insights into the developments in Ukraine. Welcome to we own doctor. I think that. Now the Kremlin has overtime insisted that Putin has no plans to invade Ukraine, yet Russia wants to declare Ukraine's two breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent territories. Isn't this meddling by Russia or Ukraine? A pause for concern? Well, I think it's you know it's it's a global flashpoint where we're closer to a global nuclear conflict than we have been in since the Cold War. So it's definitely a a crisis issue, but I think it's it's something that's been building up for for some time, and I think you know, Russia has got a number of strategic interests that drive its agenda, including trying to make sure that. Ukraine can never be used as a base for NATO missiles that could reach Moscow in such a short period of time that it's significantly weakens Russia's defence capability. I think he's also trying to. I think President Putin is also trying to send a message to smaller states in the region that if you ally with the West or NATO, you'll be left on your own and facing serious consequences. Whereas if you taken a neutral or pro Russian position, you'll be protected. So I think, yeah, there's a. There's a number of issues at play here and including as was mentioned, domestic politics in terms of his speech. I think that speech really was speaking to the Russian people. It was drenched in historical references and and culture and. I think it was also aimed at global audiences in terms of painting that the Russian perspective of the situation, and I think, just just as Chinese President Xi sees himself as the leader to reverse China's historical humiliation during colonialism. I think President Putin sees himself as the Russian leader to reverse what he sees as the humiliation after the Soviet Union collapsed. Right defying Western threats of sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian troops into two Moscow Bucks rebel regions. As peacekeepers are these signs of what's to come and what do you think is the message that Putin is trying to put across with the troops deployment and the continuous military drills? Yes, well, I think the the message is really, you know, he's targeting several audiences here. He's got the, you know, the domestic audience which he wants to show that he's sort of, you know, rejuvenating a proud Russia for regional countries. He's trying to really show that. You know that there are severe costs for countries that get closer to to NATO and the West, and he's also trying to to show the the West in the United States that you know there, there's a new Russia and it's going to throw its weight around and create its own strategic sphere of influence. Doctor Kalira in your own view. Do you think diplomacy is working or will work in the long run? Well, I think it's very difficult for diplomacy to to work in this situation. I think you've got two sort of diametrically opposed viewpoints between Russia and the West. You know, Russia wants. You know one of its its red lines is to reverse is to stop NATO expansion and and hopefully in its view to try and reverse that. And that's one of, you know, a key point that the West won't budget on either. And I think that you know, having met having met with China, President Putin is is more boosted in terms of his his confidence to be able to resist Western sanctions because, you know, China, he's got China there to act as sort of an economic shield or a buffer. And I think so. It's it's very doubtful that diplomatic efforts can can move this this forward or resolve this issue. Several countries, including India, have called. Or restrained from all sides over the Ukraine crisis to solve or to solve the matter, even as they aren't citizens to leave Ukraine. Is there a likelihood of Putin ever compromising or cooling down on the matter? Well, I think that I think for in terms of his his you know domestic audience, he would have to show us some real wins against the West if he was to to to back down in any way. Without that, I don't see it happening, and I think this this long speech was an indication of of a a very sort of determined resolve to push this quite far. So yeah, I think it's very difficult. I think that countries like India have a role to play potentially as well as as sort of neutral third parties, which I think you know in India could really could really play an important role if it stepped up. Finally, Doctor Kadira, if indeed Russia does invade Ukraine and a conflict emerges, what would be the ramifications to countries in the European bloc, the US, and perhaps countries in the quad? Yeah, so I think in terms of the European bloc it'll be very difficult for them. They have a big reliance on gas from from Russia. They have trade ties with Russia and I think there would be a lot of discussion and debate within Europe on on how to deal with that because there are very views and then we've got obviously the United States with President Biden trying to project a strong image. Facing some unpopularity at home and and yeah, countries in the quad. I think India in particular will face some interesting diplomatic challenges in the sense of trying to to walk that fine line of neutrality. And I think here we've seen the Modi government really continuing an Indian foreign policy tradition which is trying to to not take sides and and to maintain friendships with all sides. But I think this will be increasingly difficult. You've seen, I think you know in the past you've seen the United States have a lot of respect for India as a partner and including, you know, allowing India to maintain its Indian independent foreign policy and its relationships with countries like Iran. Because the United States sees how important India is in relation to China. But now where we see China and Russia forming somewhat of a bloc, you might see a different a different level of of diplomatic pressure from the United States for India to to take a position.

We have my colleague Ghazali who will get us more details on this, but before that let's just we have money Steveley who put out a tweet in regard to the situation in Chandigarh. As far as the residents who have been battling it out without water, electricity for days now since midnight of Monday. Well, love my colleagues. Ali joins us. Ghazali, schools, colleges, hospitals all bearing the brunt of this strike. Yeah, so then UT Palm and Union comprising around 1000 electricity employees. They have began a 72 hours from Monday night protesting against the privatization of the UP electricity. Now this is my call was intimated to the district administration or the UK. Big deal. I've been. Dundee Garcetti has been in Underdark. The traffic lights not working and every other sector beat the industry health education. People working from home. They're all facing the heat. The water supply has been hit even in hospitals in major hospitals, the surgeries had to be postponed in some hospitals. The vaccine, the vaccine in stock has been removed from there. So the administration is trying to negotiate with the the Power Department employees Union and even the High Court has taken a supermoto cognizant the the first Chandigarh administration is evoked the ESN at the Senchal Services Maintenance Act which prohibits the employees to go for a strike for the next couple of six months or something, but that hasn't resolved the situation as of now though the administration has also put out helpline numbers for water supply for power connection, but most parts of the city are still reeling under this power crisis."

But I want to stay informed the fear that some idiot could press a button and start a World War is very much still there. He gets all his news from Russian state television, which continually broadcasts Kremlin propaganda. Ukraine has always been a traitorous country. Always. They've always betrayed everyone. NATO does whatever it wants there. Oh, like believes the United States and NATO are provoking war in Ukraine. It's just business only business. They're doing everything to ensure this war business continues and water the Russian military buildup on Ukraine's borders, worrying the international community. The other way is no. I'm not aware of it. They don't show that to us, but it's on Russian land. It's our country and we can do what we want. In central Moscow, this opinion is widely shared. I know for sure that we have never taken any aggressive actions, never. Russia is only defending itself. The fault lies with Ukrainian politicians. Bladimir Putin is doing what he can to help out. Why does the US want to stir up war indirectly? Ukraine is essentially a cash cow steeped in blood. According to independent opinion polling organization lavada, only 4% of Russians say that their country is responsible for the crisis, 50% blamed the US and 16% blame Ukraine. Installing a conflict switch right? It's a very simplistic view of the conflict. There's us. And then there's the enemy. Since we've been talking about it for a long time, everyone is now tired of it. People don't want to go into the details. They are satisfied with the little they've had. After successfully weaponizing national media, the Russian government can feel confidence that public opinion is firmly on its side. In this critical phase of an unpredictable conflict."

Zee News Apps : https://bit.ly/ZeeNewsApps","What comes to your mind when I say North Korea? This man. All these nuclear weapons, do you know? North Korea is called the hermit Kingdom. It is the world's most isolated country, the world's most secretive country. North Korea is pitch dark. If you look at it from space, it is short of electricity short of food and money. You aren't allowed to use the Internet or keep a pet travel outside the country, make international calls. Wear blue denims, take a hot shower at home or even use contraception. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is anything but a democracy. It's a confused mix of Confucianism, Communism, dictatorship, tyranny, dynasty and lost promises. How did North Korea end up this way? Hello and welcome to gravitas Sample Key Shimao Paideia. In this episode we look at the profile of a rogue state. The year is 2021. Let's rewind to 1945, the Second World War had just come to an end. After decades of Japanese protectionism, the fate of the Korean Peninsula was left at the mercy of the Soviets and the Americans. They divided Korea into two zones, the north and the South along the 38th parallel. The South was pro United States. The north was influenced by the Soviet Union. They installed a Communist guerrilla leader named Kim Ilseng. As a premier of North Korea. He's the force of the four Kims we will talk about. In this episode, Kim Ilseng original name was Kim Sung Joo. He was born in Korea, trained in China, had fought the Japanese, reportedly also lived in Russia. He was now back in Korea with a new name, Kim Ilseng, meaning Kim become the son. Although what he actually became was a dictator three years after assuming power, Kim Ilseng invaded the South. War broke out. It lasted three years in July 1953, and Armistice was signed. After the war, Kimmel soon declared the ideology of Juche, meaning self reliance. The state assumed all controls over property and economy. North Korea invested heavily in mining, built its military. The country's economy boomed, but it's soon hit stagnation. N Koreans began slipping into poverty, cut to 1994. Kim Ilseng died of a heart attack and with him died. The promise of Juche or self reliance. Enter the second Kim Kim Jong Ill the sun. Of Kim Ilseng, he instituted a new policy. Songun changqi meaning military first. The ordinary citizens became all the more neglected and isolated in the mid 1990s. North Korea was struck by a famine at least 2 1/2 to 3 million people died. The country desperately needed international aid, but Kim Jong ills policies were bent on closing all doors despite signing the nuclear non Proliferation Treaty. Kim Jong Ill March towards his nuclear dreams in the year 2006, North Korea carried out its first underground nuclear test. Five years later, Kim Jong-il died he too. Of a heart attack, enter the third. Kim Kim Jong Un. He was just 27. He secured his position by executing his uncle and poisoning his half brother at a Malaysian airport, also silencing at least 300 odd top military leaders in his country. Kim wasted no time in accelerating North Korea's nuclear program between 2016 and 2017, he conducted 3 nuclear tests, including a hydrogen bomb and 30 short and long missile launches, including an intercontinental missile launch. 3 dictators and 74 years of rule by the Kim dynasty. Later this is where North Korea stands internationally isolated. North Korea has been sanctioned by the United Nations by the United States, South Korea, the European Union, Japan and Australia. This country is starving. It has a population of 25 million at least 10 million of these people are malnourished. This is according to the UN World Food Program. Most families in North Korea can manage only two meals a day. Many live on corn. The pandemic has worsened the situation. North Korea relies on. China, for almost all of its external trade. In January 2020, Pyongyang sealed its borders between June and September, the country was hit by severe flood. By August, North Korea reduced imports from China by almost 75% in October. North Korea said the Wuhan virus can spread through migratory birds, animals, snow and even the yellow dust blowing into the country from China. As we speak, North Korea does not have enough food to feed its people. Kim Jong-un has banned all emergency aid no one dares to contest Kim's policies North Korea hero worships its supreme leader. People shed tears at the glimpse of Kim Jong-un. The sycophancy has paved the way for some really absurd policies. North Koreans were recently forced to give up their pet dogs so that they can be used for restaurant meat. North Koreans have been told to produce 200 pounds of human. When you're a day to fertilize the soil and revitalize the country's economy. And I'm not joking. In 2020, Kim Jong Un issued a ban on pet ownership. He called it a quote UN quote tainted trend by bourgeois ideology. There is a world of difference between the life of an ordinary North Korean and the exorbitant lifestyle of its dictator. Kim spent $33,000 on American alcohol and more than $95,000 in German wine in 2016. The caviar he eats is imported from Iran. His coffee is flown in from Brazil while his people starve to death. Kim eat steaks of Kobe beef buys Christian Dior for his wife, spends upwards of three and a half $1,000,000 in lingerie. For his pleasure Squad owns an $8 million yacht, a fleet of over 100 cars. I wonder where he drives them. North Korea has 25,554 kilometers of roads, but only 724 kilometers are paved. Parents are banned from naming their children, Kim Jong-un. Only 14 hairstyles have been approved for North Korean women. Men are not allowed to grow their hair longer than 5 centimeters. This country has no parallels in today's world. A lot of what North Korea is today has to do with its obsession with the US. Do you know North Koreans refer to Americans as big noses? Kim Jong Ill wanted to avenge the Korean War. The Kim dynasty believes the only way to ensure history does not repeat itself is by building fear. Hence the nuclear program nukes are also Pyongyang's way of negotiating with the world. The recent examples include the Singapore and Vietnam Summit between Kim Jong Un and former U.S. President Donald Trump. the US wanted the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang asked for sanctions to be lifted. For once the world thought this was the beginning of a thaw. And then in May 2019, North Korea resumed its short range ballistic missile test in June 2020. North Korea marked the 2nd anniversary of the Singapore Summit by declaring that it is bolstering its nuclear deterrence. There was no looking back on the 21st of March 2021. North Korea fired off 2 cruise missiles. Four days later it fired 2 short range ballistic missiles, a type which violates UN Security Council sanctions. But for how long can North Korea continue this way? The pandemic was a golden opportunity for Pyongyang to reconnect with the world. All it had to do was accept humanitarian shipments. But Kim Jong Un had other plans. Do you know before taking every important decision, Kim rides a White Horse to Mount Pick 2? This is North Korea's tallest peak, also an active volcano. Mount Peak two is believed to be the birth place of Kim Jong Ill. The mountain also served as a military base for the first Kim, so every time you see a photo like this, you should know there's something cooking. North Korea is caught in a time warp, but the world doesn't really know what this country looks like. As we speak factory output in North Korea has fallen to its lowest level since Kim took power in 2011. The price of staples like sugar, has quadrupled the future looks worse. This is Kim Yo Jong the fourth game of our story. She is Kim Jong-un sister. She was once called the Evanka of North Korea. This is after she led the North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic. Turns out he's more unpredictable than her brother after returning from South Korea, she began issuing threats to Seoul. She recently warned you as President Joe Biden to quote UN quote, not cause a stink if it wants to sleep in peace for the coming. For years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step. That's what she said of the US. A couple of days ago she called the South Korean leader a parrot Kim. Yo Jong became the new face of the Kim dynasty when rumors of Kim Jong-un's illness slash death emerged. Is she the future dictator of the Hermit Kingdom? In all probability, the 4th game two seems bent on driving North Korea further away from civilization and globalization."

Zee News Apps : https://bit.ly/ZeeNewsApps","NATO strategy is clear. They do not want Ukraine versus Russia. They want Russia versus the rest of the world. And this was always the Western attitude. You're either with us or against us, and we've seen glimpses of this attitude first during the quad meeting in Melbourne. And again last week at the Munich Security Conference, India Foreign Minister station car was also in attendance there. During every panel discussion, every talk he was asked just one question. What are you doing about Russia? If Europe is helping in the Indo Pacific, why aren't Indo Pacific nations helping out in Europe? That was a question he was asked. Minister Jaishankar had this to say. I don't think the situations in the Indo Pacific and the transatlantic are really analogous, and certainly the the assumption in your question. That somehow there's a tradeoff, and you know one country does this in the Pacific, so it return you do something else. I don't think that's the way international relations work. In fact, if there was a connection by that logic, you would have had a lot of European powers very early, taking very sharp positions in the Indo Pacific, and we didn't see that we haven't seen that since 2009. Is IT security is not just European security? Security is the same everywhere in the Atlantic and the Pacific in Africa the factors may change, but the principle does not. Until recently the West never cared about the Indo Pacific China could sail wherever they wanted, bully, whoever it wanted. It was only when China's ambitions turned global that the West intervened, and even then they're biased, persisted. I can give you the perfect example. Nuclear submarines India repeatedly requested this technology from the US each time it was rejected. Cut to September 2021, Aug was announced. the US agreed to share nuclear technology with Australia no for India yet for Australia. This was the American attitude. Throughout the last century. So obviously India looked elsewhere and that elsewhere was Russia. Right now, New Delhi biggest worries China. Their piracy in the Indo Pacific, their belligerence in the Himalayas on that Minister Jaishankar was unequivocal. He did not just talk about the physical aggression. He talked about China, debt, diplomacy. The message was pretty simple and clear. Every country can make their own choices, but before that, ask yourself one question. What am I getting into? Every country will look for opportunities and see what it can do. But while doing so, it's in their own interest to be prudent about what they're getting into to do the due diligence we have seen. Now, countries, including in our region, being saddled with large debts. We have seen projects where which are commercially unsustainable airports, whereas aircraft doesn't come harbours, whereas ship doesn't come. So I think people would be justified in. Asking themselves what am I getting into? From Munich, Jaishankar flew to Paris. He held talks with French foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian and the talks covered three major issues. Defense cooperation, the Indo Pacific and Ukraine on Defence India has two projects in mind. One making aircraft engines in India and two jointly developing a nuclear submarine on the Indo Pacific. India has a larger mission. The entire world is focused on Ukraine at the moment every journalist, every intelligence agency and this could be a valuable distraction for China. So New Delhi. Role is to keep Beijing in focus to make sure that the world does not forget about the Indo Pacific. On Tuesday, Jaishankar has the perfect opportunity. The European Union Forum on the Indo Pacific. Every European Foreign Minister will be attending this and Minister Jaishankar is among the speakers. The third issue during the talks was Ukraine. And let me quote from what the joint statement says. The two ministers reiterated their shared commitment to the principles of multilateralism and a rules based order and agreed to coordinate in the UN Security Council on issues of mutual concern. This statement sums up India's policy. New Delhi is not encouraging Russia buildup. It is not condoning an invasion. At the same time, it is not spreading panic. No flight cancellations, no warnings of impending doom. India's policies, practical and peaceful. He use talks to deescalate and be consider the interests of all nations, not just the Western powers. What India is doing is a delicate diplomatic dance and so far it's been working. Russia and the US are not complaining about India's position. Neither are they trying to recruit New Delhi. It gives you an idea about India strategic importance. The question is what does India want to do with that importance? Focus on its neighborhood or take a deeper view of European security.

FAQ 👉 https://bbc.in/2m8ks6v.","In the factories kitchen, chef Maneesha Barrett is giving me the lowdown on getting rice right. OK, so First things first, let's see how you make rice at home. Well, I make it brilliantly because it's different every time, so you never really know what you're going to get. Come on, show me how you do it. That's two people, probably. Buffalo. How long do you think it'll take to cook? I tap it to see if it's ready. It's starting to get soft now, OK, and you know that because you've been tapping it, 'cause the tap tap tap tap tap tap. Can I interest you in a slice of rice maneesha? Thank you. I've never had one before. How is it roar and Muffy at the same time? I mean, it's slightly you know, double. I've given this to people and they've never come back. Chair has four foolproof rules to ensure I never mess up my rice again, so I'm making rice by the absorption method, the absorption method, one measure of rice and double the amount of water by volume. That's crucial. Drying out rice and water in this one to two ratio is rule number one, so let's start off by washing the rice because it's still got a little bit of loose starch. The second rule is to rinse because any starch left on the grains will make them clog together. Give it a good rinse till the water runs. Clear Rule 3. Use the right pan you want to choose a plan that is heavy bottomed and has a tight fitting lid. Why is that important? Because you want to lock the steam in. That's what's going to cook the rice. The rice is going to absorb all the liquid that you put in here, so you don't want any of the steam to escape. Tip it all into the pan and turn up the heat. So the rice has come up to the boil. I'll just give it a little stir. I'll turn the heat right down and put this lid on. The final rule is leave it alone. You don't want to lift the lid. You don't want to peak, you just leave it and let it do its thing. It's very low maintenance. This method it is after 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it stand for another 5 minutes. Then so it's not warwich. Every green is separate. It's all fluffed up. It tastes nutty and sweet and lovely because it's got the aroma. It's got the taste and it's also got texture."

Inside Kim Kardashian's Home Filled With Wonderful Objects | Vogue","Maybe a little creepy, but my dad. It's so cool. I used to work at MCA so it's on his letterhead and it says, Kimberly, I cut your hair on April 11th 1988 and there's my hair. Hey Vogue, it's Kim. We're here in my home once again. A few things have been updated. I've like filled it up with some amazing art and all my favorite things. I can't wait to show you. We're in my family kitchen and everything in my house is really minimal. I find that there's so much chaos out in the world that when I come home I want it to be just really quiet and I want everything to feel calming. It's like I have the playroom filled with clutter bedrooms. One is pink, one is purple, one is blue, one is dinosaurs. It's like each kid can have their. For style and taste in their bedroom and have so much fun but in the main house I really like the calmness and shockingly 4 kids hasn't messed up my cream house. So the first object of my affection is my daughter, North paintings and drawings. She's a really, really good artist and she loves to paint. She did this about two years ago. She does like little paintings for me like this wolf. She did do one of our bearded dragon. Recently North stayed home and had COVID, so this is her drawing that she did in her room. It's a charcoal, maybe that was just her emo mood, so I love seeing like the personality and the moods and everything that she goes through and is feeling. It's really been an amazing hobby of hers. So now we're in the sitting room to my bedroom. It's really cozy. It's like a place where I love to just sit and have tea and write letters to my kids. And I make the most epic baby books for them. So I'm going to show you guys, anyone knows me. They know that I love to scrapbook so that my kids can have the most amazing memories. This is Norris, but I have him for. Each kid I have all of their little hospital details. I've written out, you know, Mom and Dad history, her first Vogue shoot, everyone that visited her, the sonograms. What I ate the whole pregnancy, my first trip to the zoo. We went to Arizona during the Super Bowl time. We went to the Santa Barbara Zoo. I really wanted to archive these memories and it's just it's really really cute. So you know I have. Each kid has their own book. Pictures from all their baby showers to how their birth announcement was, so it's like so interesting you'll see like emojis where such a thing for Saints and I announced him with emojis. Snapchat was such a thing. I guess I'd have to do a tick tock announcement these days and then I write you know these long letters. I write a letter to each one of my kids on their birthday and then I asked this series of questions to each of my kids questions like describe yourself, what are you thankful for? What makes you happy? What makes you sad or? Angry what's important to you like, really fun stuff and it'll just be so fun when they are older you can see why I love to archive all things for my kids. They have the best memories and I'll show you exactly where I got it from. So my mom made this trunk for each of us has every single birthday until I'm 10 years old. Every birthday card that I got from all of my friends and my grandparents and my great grandparents like this is my great grandparents. My grandma, MJ's mom and dad so it's really cool that I just have all of these cards and all of these memories. There's so many things in here like this would always sit on my bed. I had a Bunny room. My mom knitted this. Where is my Minnie mouse. I'm gonna find my mini 'cause Minnie was everything to me. Oh my mom saved my favorite costume. I wore this when I was four years old and I was obsessed with Minnie Mouse. The pictures of me and my mom dressed like Minnie Mouse are so incredibly cute. I still have them. I could sit here all day but I think we should move on to some other things that I really love. I want to take you guys outside. Alright, so now we're in my backyard. It's literally the most amazing place for the kids to really hang out, and the basketball court especially is where the kids love to be. You know, I didn't want your typical basketball court. I don't know if you can see the material of the ground, but it's like spongy and I just wanted it really neutral. All my gym equipment is black, so the cord is black. The basketball hoops are black. With like a cream little box and who patent really know what that part is called, you know I just wanted it to look like it matched my whole house and this is just like when it's summertime in the pools right here and the gym connected to the basketball court. Music blasting and kids are in the pool and me and my sisters are like plunging up and down the basketball court. There's nothing more fun than a good workout day at my house and the other place out here that I really wanted to show you guys is our Meadow up there. So if you go up there, you'll see a huge vegetable garden. So many trees, and so we grow our own fruits and vegetables and we pick them and eat them just from there. We do it together as a family. All of the cousins come over and we have little basket and they just see how you really can like farm and eat it. I love showing you guys all of my domestic things and all of the sentimental things and special things in my home. But as you guys know I'm a working woman so I have to go to work. I have to go to my office. I gotta run but on the way out. I'll show you guys one of my prized possessions. I've always been a car girl. I love cars and I really wanted something different. I wanted my cars to kind of blend in and my house is Gray and I wanted him to kind of match the house. So I did all grey cars instead of my typical matte silver that I used to do. I put out my 3 faves, my Lamborghini Urus, which has this kid on the front of it so it looks a little different in my Rolls Royce is great also. It's a ghost. It has like the cutest little crystal lady and I just think that's so unique. And then my favorite baby ever, ever ever is the Maybach sedan. I love everything about it. I love painting like the emblem Grey. If I were to pick one. That's my baby, right? Thank you guys so much for coming into my home to check out some of my favorite things. They're my objects of affection, but now I've gotta go to work so I'll see you guys soon."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SgXbFjzZGM,Why Hailey and Justin Bieber Are Holding Off on Having Kids,"Hailey Bieber is opening up about her decision to hold off on having kids with her husband, Justin Bieber. The 25-year-old model gets candid about her personal and professional life in 'WSJ. Magazine's Spring Fashion issue, on newsstands Feb. 12.","Patience, patience with myself. I bet you when I have kids I'm going to be like I didn't even know what patients was before that Hailey Bieber is getting candid about when she plans to have kids with her husband Justin. I'm excited the 25 year old model graces the cover of WSJ magazine, spring women fashion issue and inside. She's an open book about her life, specifically when she and her hubby plan to expand their family, Haley tells the mag in part, quote. Everybody always assumes it's. First comes love, then comes marriage. Then comes the baby. Well, what about all the things I want to accomplish in my business. She also says initially it was ingrained in her mind to have kids immediately after getting married, but she had a change of heart quote. I turned 25 and I'm like I'm still super super young. So when does the couple think they'll be ready? Haley says. I think ideally in the next couple of years we would try. But there's a reason they call it try right? You don't know how long that process has. Ever going to take? Definitely no kids this year? That would be a little bit hectic I think. Hopefully with Chris shouting nugget. As for Justin's perspective on the whole kids thing, well, he opened up in his documentary last year. Justin Bieber, our world in 2021. Anyway, we we we start trying. We shall see. And back in 2020, the Ghost singer revealed Ellen DeGeneres how many kids he wants. I think it's up to Haley because it's her body when it comes to the couple's nearly four year long marriage, Haley tells the mag how surprisingly normal things are despite being in the limelight, the New York native says they're just regular people. Quote, I think, given the magnitude of Justin's career, he's a very normal person, and I don't think that always happens. What do you love about Justin? He's really funny. We have a good time together. He's just really sweet. He's a good kid. He's a good heart and I love him. And As for what married life has taught Haley, she says it's an exercise in patience, patience with myself, patience with my partner patients. With. My dog patients just in every aspect of the word."

What’s Changing About Fashion’s Relationship to the Body? | Vogue","One more time without moving forward so much. Look over here. And then this camera. We've been sold alive that we're supposed to all look and exist the same way. I felt like I had to prove myself as a woman and fit into a certain narrative of what that means. People commenting to me in person about my shape. My size after you turn your hips or not the right size. I'm glad. Do you charge? I'm not new anymore and then I would like enough. Now it just sounds so stupid. Every time I say it. Something that really impresses me. About my body is it has its own instinct. I really like my skin. It has warmth and softness and coarse fits and dimpled bits, and I feel like it represents me. How's that? When I started to see women like Salma Hayek and like Jennifer Lopez, my eyes just like opened up 'cause I was like OK they like look way more like me than anything I've ever seen. After having heard that I had stretch marks, my ***** was spices big. But seeing all my baby just love up on me grabbing my side fat. Made me just appreciate my body even more. You know my body has been part of my journey from the very beginning of life until till now, and it's what takes us through. I don't really feel like I'm in an age necessarily. I don't know. I feel ageless. There are a lot of caricatures, what it means to be a man or a woman imposed on trans people. But the body that I was born into is my body and the way that I move through the world is myself. There was strength that I didn't even know that I had. This womanly this is strong for me. It's all those kind of pretty well the body will do you strong. See my muscles and when you see yourself as beautiful, beautiful, so way of stepping into your own power. My body. My body is filled with my body. My body it's sacred to me, you know and it's my own."

Everything You Need to Know About the Miniskirt From the 1960s to Now | Vogue","Although we're living in a time when covering our faces is expected if not required, our legs are another story. Skin is once again in could the resurgence of rising hemlines be a response to pandemic era restrictions? I'm Hamish Bowles Vogue's global editor at large and from the leggy liberation of the 1960s youthquake to the barely there micro skirts from the spring 2022 runways. I'm here to tell you everything you need to know about the mini skirt. When we think about the mini skirt in mainstream contemporary culture and fashion, we might think first of the swinging 60s, but it actually has a far far older history. It appears that many from noblemen in ancient Egypt to the Ladies of Don xinyao favored the revealing wardrobe piece we know and love today in European and American fashion. The long hemlines of women skirts began inching their way up in the early 20th century, and all those scandalized by a bear ankle. We're soon to be rocked by the roaring 1920s and the enormously popular flapper girl era, with Josephine Baker's iconic banana skirt and LA Mode sportive made popular by Coco Chanel and legendary tennis player Suzanne Longclaw and her designer Jean Patou, women's legs were both on display and on the move. Some began speculating that the length of women skirts was somehow intrinsically linked to the booming stock market and thus the hemline index. The theory that hemlines rise in times of economic growth. And fall in times of strife was born, but what goes up must always come down, and the stock market crash of 1929 once again sparked a more conservative approach to women's fashion during the Second World War. Fabric rationing, introduced to prioritize uniforms over fashion, necessarily made skirts skimpier after the war, Christian Dior's New Look brought long full skirts into fashion, and it wasn't until the 1950s that rock and roll and. You dance crazes, spread the need for shorter outfits. Women could groove in more freely. Couture and Hollywood soon followed suit. Whether it was balenciaga's above the knee sack dress, Isalo strippers line for Dior in 1958, or the costumes in science fiction and Space Age films. At the moment everyone got the hint, the miniskirt, and it's official. Monica took over the global fashion stage during what Vogues Deanna Greene and called a Youthquake, and like the 20s before it. The strand of the 60s was influenced by and for a youth culture that was pushing boundaries and exploring sexual identity in a rapidly changing society. Mary Quant, often considered to have invented the miniskirt, although that is up for discussion, was a design leader in the London boutique movement inspired by school girls dresses under short skirts of tap dancers, soon everyone who was anyone couldn't be spotted without one. It was then that Quresh achieved internationally. Claim for his 1964 collection, featuring miniskirts with an oat couture twist while Packer abandoned Emanuel Ungaro. Utilized metal industrial, plastics and synthetics to create ultra modern space age accessories and garments. Not everyone, however, was on board the miniskirt spaceship. Many schools banned students from skirts above the knee. That's to say nothing of the fashion elites disapproval famously, including Coco Chanel. She considered needs a woman, ugliest. Feature, but that didn't stop 39 year old Jacqueline Kennedy from wearing this Valentino dress to her 1968 wedding to Aristotle Onassis. The miniskirt, it seemed, could transcend space time and age. The 1970s saw some rest fight from the Mini mania thanks to the hippie era's long flowing skirts and bell bottoms. But by the 1980s the miniskirt re emerged as the answer for women everywhere. Frilly Ross, Kurtz working girl suits, and the unisex Plaid kilts designed by Jean Paul Gautier in 1984, offered a new versatility to the item, and the craze hardly slowed its role. The Saatchi Bowl printed or monochromatic minis and power suits and Karl Lagerfeld twist on Chanel. Plastic looks of the 1960s reinvigorated the mini for the MTV generation. The early aughts saw the invention of the Mini mini or the micro skirt with the help of these paparazzi obsessed if girls making the low rise highly cropped and often denim version, a touchstone of the era, now almost 20 years later, that miniskirt is back, thanks in part to Mew Mew Spring Summer 2022 collection. What was once a look perpetuated by mainly tall. Thin and young women of the 1960s is now a trend for people of all shapes, ages, and gender identities and whether the miniskirts return is due to nostalgia for decades past or a symbol of future economic growth, we can all agree that perhaps less really is more."

For non fungible tokens on Monday with a range of digital art commemorating what she called iconic moments from her time in office selling for $50 apiece, early trade was brisk with items being snapped up by supporters every six to 10 seconds, according to a tally on our website. Happy Presidents Day tweeted the former First lady as the 10,000 tokens went on sale. Buyers received. One of five designs featuring images including the Trump's aboard the Trump aboard Air Force One or during a visit to Mount Rushmore. Some 10,000 tokens were made available in all, with buyers unaware of the design they would receive until it landed in their cryptocurrency wallet. If they all sell, that would bring in a cool half $1,000,000. The sale marked a new strategy for the First Lady whose most recent activity in the market involved. The high priced auction and questions about who had actually paid for the winning bid. Cryptocurrency sleuths traded an online wallet used to pay. For a $270,000 lot that included artwork and a hat worn by the First lady to an address used to sell the items, suggesting either Trump or the project's creator paid for the bid, the latest venture was announced last week. I'm proud to expand upon my NF platform and am honored to be able to recognize important moments in our nation's history, said Trump. I took I look forward to collaborating with others to offer truly special, authentic parts of U.S. history. Trump provided creative direction for the collection. According to a statement from her office. The collection used uses the. Atlanta blockchain protocol with right wing social network parlor powering the platform, it said.

During the state visit of the French President to the White House in 2018, a watercolor of her wearing it and an EFT of the painting.

#NextNews","Biden asked if he underestimated Putin. Then this morning, Trump ripped him a new one. Before I get to that, if you're new here, hit that red button down below to subscribe, then tap the notification bell so you are the first to know when the latest news is published. Well, just like the rest of the world, Donald Trump is watching what's playing out between Russia and Ukraine, and it's not pretty, especially the part about it appearing to be that Putin is being is playing Joe Biden like a fiddle or maybe a drum. Let's see what Trump had to say. Joha from Gateway Pundit reports. President Trump released 2 short statements this morning about the status of Biden's America in his first statement, President Trump shared quote. Our country has totally lost its self confidence in his second statement, President Trump shared quote. Putin is playing Biden like a drum. It is not a pretty thing to watch. Well, President Trump is unfortunately correct in both statements. Biden is the worst thing for America and the world right now. Yesterday Russia lawmakers gave President Putin permission to use. Military force outside of the country. Several European leaders said earlier in the day that Russian troops have moved into rebel held areas in eastern Ukraine after Putin recognized their independence. Biden said, quote, who in the Lords name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belongs to his neighbors. This is a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from. The International community Biden said that Tuesday as Putin brushed off his threat of sanctions. Take a listen. Who in the Lords name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors? This is a flagrant violation of international law and demands a firm response from the international community over the last few months. We've coordinated closely with our NATO allies and partners in Europe and around the world to prepare that response, we've said all along, and I've told Putin into his face some month, a month or more in the month ago that we would act together. And the moment Russia moved against Ukraine. Russia has now undeniably moved against Ukraine by declaring these independent states. So today I'm announcing the first tranche of sanctions to impose costs on Russia in response to their actions yesterday. And here is Biden back in 2019 claiming Putin doesn't want him to become president. Take a listen. Putin knows if I am president. United States his days of tyranny and trying to intimidate the United States and those in Eastern Europe are over. I'm going to stand up to him. He's a bully, just like the president, and I know he doesn't want me to be president, but to tell you what when I'm president, things are going to change. It's as if Putin is on purpose, calling Biden 2019 bluff. He's not afraid of Joe Biden, and he's showing it notice Putin didn't try this when Trump was POTUS and it's not as the Democrats want us to believe because Trump was somehow on Putin side. Tell us why you think Putin never tried what he's trying now when Trump was president. Comment below. Subscribe for updates. If you like what we're doing here, give us a thumbs up.

But the truth is, most people sadly don't follow the news. So we mashed a bunch of different subjects from the news together into one long and nonsensical question. Today went out in the street. We asked pedestrians. Do you support Russia decision to protect NATO with a blockchain NFT, even though it may cause a World War? Wordle on Nord Stream 2. Which of course makes no sense. But that didn't stop the pundits out on Hollywood Blvd for trying to answer it in the confusing question of the day. With so much happening, let me ask you this. Do you support Russia's decision to protect NATO with the blockchain NFT, even though it may cause a World War Wordell on Nord Stream 2? I do not, you know any type of oppression, just it's just not a good idea. Simple. Follow up for you. Yeah, encanto. Yes and cancel. In terms of Russia and the NFT and NATO and the blockchain. Yeah, and World War Wardell and Nord Stream 2 Encanto. No, do you support Russia's decision to protect NATO with the blockchain and FT even though it may cause a World War Wordell on Nord Stream 2? I really don't support it, but I don't know all the inner workings of it. You know, I'm saying you're a journalist, yeah, so you keep up on what's happening, yeah, I tried to let me ask you this. Do you support Russia's decision to protect NATO with a blockchain NFT, even though it may cause a World War? Wardle on Nord Stream 2. Get to be honest. Yeah, as a journalist as a journalist, I really don't have too much clue about that. I'm afraid I know about entertainment news, unfortunately. So if you want to ask me about Kanye, unfortunately probably know about that. How does Kanye feel about Russia's decision to protect native with a product even though it may cause a World War War lawnmower scheme too? As Kanye, I think he bought. It thinks it's a brilliant idea. You know he doesn't like these godless people. So yeah, I think he's going to be in total support of that. OK, here, let's ask. Let's ask these guys up there. Window washers can I ask you a question? Do you support Russia's decision to protect NATO with a blockchain NFT, even though it may cause a World War world on Nord Stream 2? No. It's a quick follow up in Canto. Did you hear me? Think about it, let me know when you come down. I gotta say that you didn't want to talk about about Bruno, I guess.

The results back then weren't great, so we did it again to see if we're headed in the right direction. We're not Hollywood Blvd and ask pedestrians of the Caucasian variety. Do you have a black friend? This is how it works. We're going to see someone introduce themselves based solely on the introduction. Together we will guess if that person has a black friend, does everyone understand alright, our first pedestrian is. Sorry, what's your name? My name is Ellen hi Ellen.

#masterchef #masterchefaustralia #howtocook","It's Gordon. We want you to cook us a dish. That is worthy of winning the competition. Whoever cooks the best dish today? I bet you guys know what I'm talking about. Gets this. Or should I say the immunity? It's so hot in here, there's baci grills going everywhere. Everyones got ovens on everyone's got stoves on. We're running out of time now and you need a pin so close I can taste it. I am making pistachio and strawberry eclair's. I am a Baker and I'm obsessed issue pastry. I've got my shoe in the oven. I've got my gel setting in the freezer and I've got my cream pat chilling so next step is to temper some chocolate for some garnish. They must have no no to melt chocolate in the microwave. The master Chef Kitchen is really hot. It's going to be really hard to control that temperature. Fingers crossed this works. Need to take this from Justin Oclair to a masterpiece. Amelia, it's your time to shine. This dish totally represents me as a cook. It is understated, but it is technically driven. This is what I love to do. What is that? That is a pistachio and strawberry eclair? Stunning, it's packaged beautifully. It's breathtaking. It is mind-blowing. Can you guys see that? The front cover of a magazine right there. I'll say it straight off the bat. You nailed the eclair. The balance of flavor, the tartness balance with the richness of the the pistachio cream. The cream pat that consistency was just absolutely gorgeous. It's amazing, thanks. Looks like it's absolutely flawless. Round one you right at the top of the pack so you should be so happy with yourself. Hold on. I've never seen a Claire so decorative, but it's a dessert. You know it's the master chef. Winning dessert because the texture inside is difficult to nail and what you've done with the chocolate it's it's textbook. What a way to start this competition because whoever wins season twelve, 2020. Serves two of those truckers because the competition is standing behind you, that right now has put a big target on your back. Well done, amazing. Pretty good, my God, I've never seen any Claire that elevated. And the heat, the kitchen and the tempering, the chocolate and the disc. The run out the cream. Wow, there you go. Well done million. Thank you. Pretty good meals. Amelia, I said it to the judges. I've never seen any Claire like that. That was heart. But it is out that tasted phenomenal. Thank you, Danny. You blew us away with that authenticity. Whatever happens. Stick close to that shrunken husband of yours. Ignore. I made him a try. Where's he from here, right? You brought a feast, something authentic, but in many ways it was unique and true to your personality and we tasted that. You created technical perfection this evening and every pastry chef in Australia will be envious of what you just created because it was incredible. Laura, you know the pressure on your shoulders tonight to perform in front of this? Man, God bless you. It was exceptional and so you should be very proud. I've never seen this man, you know well up or cry except for 25 years. One told him off. So more of that please. Absolutely you 4 didn't just understand the brief you knocked it out of the park, and then you elevated it. If I could give 4 pins out tonight, you four would be wearing them, we can't."

Or his new book is cooking like a master chef and he's here with the perfect fall recipe. Please. Welcome back my buddy chef Graham Elliot. Sir. Good good alright man, let's get into it. What do we make of it? So what I'm going to do is, you know, play on good old classic chicken kung Pao style so you can get some heat. You're gonna get some sweetness, some spice, all that balance. So first thing I'm gonna do is just take my chicken right here. Season it up now just like any other kind of chicken, you could do some buttermilk action. You could code it in corn flakes, cornmeal, whatever you want. These. I'm just going to take just plain straight up right into the oil. The oil. Is at about people have put chicken and cornmeal. Don't understand what chicken is fault what, what is it for? Well, you do. You don't fry chicken in cornmeal. Don't do that. No? Alright. So now for my sauce over here. I've got already some garlic, ginger, some shallot. All this action kind of going right here, right? So? What we're gonna do now is we're going to add a little bit of mirin. No, what Mirren? So that's like a Japanese wine, rice, wine, vinegar people can go fine. Oh come on, everybody's got this in their house yeah yeah, who who all has mirroring in their house? Look at that look at the whole crowd. Alright. 6 White Ladies raised their hand. I didn't want to say that. All the black women did like this. And nobody got no damn mirrorman that house. Alright, so now I've got some already that are kind of crispy. Over here we've done our thing. I'm gonna take my sauce, right? This is already this is finished. This is finished so you're gonna do it. You got your tongue I like do it like I do my chicken like just like do it like I'm at wing stop. So you can. Well, oh. Calm down, calm down, get your chicken. Get your chicken. See how I went and got that. OK let it get on the suit. Alright, so next. I'm going to get this stuff right. This is some green onions, some scallions, some peanuts. OK, right? That's what's gonna give it that beautiful. I'm trying to learn from you now I'm trying to like do your your technique all you gotta do is go to wing stop they do that all day that's why I learn it from that's how you got this big luminum bowls and The thing is when you shift it you gotta go down then come up see I stayed up then I had to come back and catch. Athletic along, it's like a nice sport deal. Yeah it's pretty good man. Alright so I'll move this out of the way just so you can see it so these are the simple little koupal drumsticks now you know where I've never really known how to use that thing in the honey. Yes, you know I how do you so the whole thing right is if you use a spoon just sits there because I don't know like the groove the whole groove so show me how you use it. So I just kind of twirl it in there and then. Crystal frizzles like that, right? So look at look how sassy that is. OK, it looks like Tom Cruise in cocktail. Why do you? I've ended for me. It's just, you know, just A twist. Yeah man, I didn't try to hear him get it back in the bowl. Alright, I like that alright, so the chicken you know it's going to take awhile to fry maybe 12 minutes. Let it keep going OK? Well let's see how it all came together alright. So now you go over here. This is what we got there already glazed crunchy got its thing going on. And then another dish that we did out of the cookbook. It's actually a kabocha squash soup. But here we did pumpkin because it's national Pumpkin Day, so that's what it is in the pumpkin garnish with some pumpkin seed. So very pumpkin centric. It's pretty good right here? Alright good, what is this right here? Add some wine. Oh, I forgot, my wife told me. My wife told me to hold a glass on the stem. When you're on TV, she said, you know, you know, try to look like you've been somewhere. He's really good now. You can also toss them with more spice. Whatever you want, make them different. And I just want to take a second to thank you for helping write the little blurb on the back of the book. Oh yeah, you did you put it on there? I did. You know those meals that just go pile in your mouth? You know the ones that make you leap up and down. That's where Graham brings to the table, baby. He's only a master chef who can help anyone become a rock star in the kitchen, yeah? Bob Graham's new book is called cooking, like a master chef, and it's available now. Thanks chef."

If you see someone choking first ask are you OK? Are you OK? He's not OK. The international sign for choking is this. If there are others around call for help. Help. Well, looks like no ones around so you've got to help stand behind the victim and wrap your arms all the way around his chest. Find his belly button with your pinky finger. Lower. Lower. Now you've got it. Now make a fist and roll your fist up under his rib cage. Then wrap your other hand around the fist and thrust inwards and upwards, but before you thrust, take some time to do your own research. Find out what the other options are. Checked Twitter on Facebook, maybe tick Tock see that's a keen dance. Ask your yoga instructor what she thinks. I mean who is this Heimlich? Anyway? Sounds like a German named me. No offense friend. Say maybe that chunk of meat in your companion's throat was planted there by Bill Gates. What are you doing here? Don't give in to pressure from sheep. Who's to say Heimlich is even a maneuver at all? Maybe it's a hoax. Maybe Big Pharma is behind that. Don't follow the crowd. Do what's right for you. Maybe this horse pace could help. Ooh, it's an herbal Dr with a ponytail. Maybe he's got some advice. Oh that's where he was. Oh hey, you're fixed. Get vaccinated my friends. Dumbbell wow. Trust you bye yeah.

I think a lot of the grooms just wanted an anniversary. They wouldn't easily forget, but we wanted to speak to a couple who's planning to get married today in a very strange thing happened. One of our producers went on a Facebook wedding group and found what I believe is has to be the Holy Grail of two 2222 wedding couples. In fact, they're here in our studio audience tonight. And let's say hello to them right now. I'll explain why. Well I'll let you explain why you are the Holy Grail. What are your first names? Hi Jimmy, my name is 2 millimeter high Jimmy. My name is 2 as well. OK, your names are two, are they spelled differently? Yes yes. How are how is your spelled? My name is THUO K - T U and where did you meet? We met up party through our friend Carmen and did Harmon go like you're. You guys are not gonna believe this. Yeah so during the party she came up to me and she's like hey 2 used to meet my other friend too as well. And then I say OK yeah introduce me and then we'll make 4 jokes right? Sure and then later I know that's that's when we start. So this is a big deal. Not only you guys name too, you're obsessed with this number, correct? Yeah, right two. I don't even know which tool I'm talking to, but it's important it's a lucky number for us. It's a lucky, not well sure, and it's your name. It's your birth name, right? There's not a nickname. No. That's So what date? On what date did you get engaged to be married? So I proposed last year on February 2nd. First, second two, two and so. Then you decided right, then we're gonna get married today, right? On two 2222. Well, I I've planned it before, back in 2017 that after I met her that, you know, that's going to be a good date to get married. Yeah, well, yeah. You almost had to get married in a way, right? You guys were planning to tie the knot in a courthouse in Orange County tonight, but we told you that if you come and you're a special guest, we would give you a wedding party, a nearby hotel and you believe that, right? Well, you shouldn't have because you've been banned to sell this. What's happened? You're not going to get married hotel, we're gonna marry you right now on television. Yes. We star wedding shuffle. How adorable how old? Look at that. They're like twins in a horror movie, so you guys just stand right there. Yes, yes, right there you go. OK, alright, I will begin the ceremony now Are you ready ready? Look into each other's eyes. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here on Taco Tuesday to join two and two. I mean two and two. I don't know which one is which in holy matrimony today. You're beginning a new chapter. Do you have a ring? Yeah, do you have a ring? Do you? A two has a ring. There we go. We have two rings. I would like you now two and two. To put the rings on each other, hold hands for the valves and just agree with me as we go. Do you 2 twos take two another to be your lawfully wedded spouses to have and to hold together today, tomorrow, and in perpetuity? If so, say we, too, we too. 2. Promise to always be too legit to quit, but never too fast or too furious. Do you promise not to sleep in twin beds even though it will be totally on brand? Do you promise never to engage in a threesome because it would be awkward and mathematically asymmetrical? Then by the power vested in me by a sketchy website that also sells diet supplements, I now pronounce you two husband and wife. You may kiss each other. Well, you basically escape so you can see it's a two layer cake with two pock on it. And really, that's not all. What is a wedding without a honeymoon, right? We're sending you 2 to Timbuktu. We don't know anything about Timbuktu. Your family told us where is it that you really want to go to for your honeymoon to Greece degrees? So we are giving you 2 tickets to Greece. Greek yogurt 2% whatever you want to do. Let's 2nd. Anymore. Thanks for watching. If you like that video, click the subscribe button, and if you didn't like it, will you hurt my feelings?"

The truth is that there is no definitive answer, however many have pointed to a food market in Wuhan, China. Wet markets, as they are known, exist globally. These markets sell exotic and wild animals in open-air environments and are particularly popular in China, where the food is seen as cheaper, fresher and may contain special healing benefits. 

How does this relate to the deadly coronavirus COVID-19? 

Viruses that jump from animals to humans become far more dangerous because these diseases have not built up immunity in humans, and we have no vaccine or medication available to fight it. 

Viruses that jump from one animal to another animal and then to a human being even more deadly. 

This is what can happen in these wet markets, where animals are stored in close proximity, with little sanitation or health procedures. 

Ebola likely came from bats, swine flu from pigs, bird flu from birds and the SARS virus from 2003 also came from animals. And although we don’t know how many viruses came from wet markets, it is highly likely according to scientists that these markets have caused serious outbreaks in the past, and may have caused the most recent pandemic in December last year. 

Despite this, instead of closing down these wet markets after the SARS outbreak 20 years ago, or even after the COVID-19 epidemic currently engulfing the world, China has started to reopen its wet markets in Wuhan after lockdown, the ground zero of the virus.

We hear about calories all the time: How many calories are in this cookie? How many are burned by doing 100 jumping jacks, or long-distance running, or fidgeting? But what is a calorie, really? And how many of them do we actually need? Emma Bryce explains how a few different factors should go into determining the recommended amount for each person.

Lesson by Emma Bryce, animation by  Qa'ed Mai.","We hear about calories all the time. How many calories are in this cookie? How many are burned by 100 jumping jacks or long distance running or fidgeting? But what is a calorie really? And how many of them do we actually need? Calories are a way of keeping track of the body's energy budget. A healthy balance occurs when we put in about as much energy as we lose. If we consistently put more energy into our bodies than we burn, the excess will gradually be stored as fat in our cells and will gain weight if we burn off more energy than we replenish, we'll lose weight. So we have to be able to measure the energy we consume and use, and we do so with a unit called the calorie 1 calorie, the kind we measure in food, also called a large calorie, is defined as the amount of energy it would take to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius. Everything we consume has a calorie count, a measure of how much energy the items stores in its chemical bonds. The average pizza slice has 272 calories. There are about 78 in a piece of bread and an apple has about 52. That energy is released during digestion and stored in other molecules that can be broken down to provide energy when the body needs it. It's used in three ways. About 10% enables digestion. About 20% fuels physical activity, and the biggest chunk around 70% supports the basic functions of our organs and tissues. That third usage corresponds to your basal metabolic rate. A number of calories you would need to survive if you weren't eating or moving around. Add in some physical activity and digestion and you arrive at the official guidelines for how many calories the average person requires each day. 2000 for women and 2500 for men. Those estimates are based on factors like average weight, physical activity and muscle mass. So does that mean everyone should shoot for around 2000 calories? Not necessarily if you're doing an energy guzzling activity like cycling the Tour de France, your body could use up to 9000 calories per day. Pregnancy requires slightly more calories than usual, and elderly people typically have a slower metabolic rate. Energy is burned more gradually, so less is needed. Here's something else you should know before you start counting calories. The calorie counts on nutrition labels measure how much energy the food contains, not how much energy you can actually get out of it. Fibrous foods like celery and whole wheat take more energy to digest, so you'd actually wind up with less energy from 100 calorie serving of celery than 100 calorie serving of potato chips. Not to mention the fact that some foods offer nutrients like protein and vitamins while others provide far less nutritional value. Eating too many of those foods could leave you overweight and malnourished. And even with the exact same food, different people might not get the same number of calories variations in things like enzyme levels, gut bacteria, and even intestine length means that every individual's ability to extract energy from food is a little different, so a calorie is a useful energy measure. But to workout exactly how many of them each of us requires, we need to factor in things like exercise, food type, and our body's ability to process. Energy good luck finding all of that on a nutrition label."

(http://vblocks.com/x/BuzzFeedYouTube)","OK, now open up and say ah. What's the best way to respond when you ask us a question while working on my mouth? We understand that there's a lot of things that are in your mouth when we do work, and it's difficult to communicate. I guess. Kind of just be like uh-huh or wink that you agree. I think we just do it naturally. It's a thing that we forget that we're in your mouth. You should not do is basically move your head or grab our arm to tell us to stop. We don't want to hurt you with the with the instruments in your mouth. Do you judge us if we don't brush before an appointment? A lot of people don't brush before. It is pretty obvious. Well, it really doesn't make a difference if you brush right before the appointment. I personally don't judge, but I do give my patients a hard time and I'm like, yeah, I can totally tell that you didn't brush 'cause it's gonna be a bloody scene. Have people done weird things when you were working in their mouth? Yes, I've actually had a patient lick my finger while I was working on them. I couldn't believe it. I was just in there mouth working on them and their tongue lick my finger and then they did it again. They were definitely aware of it because they were looking at me. They were doing it. I just went ahead and just finished the procedure and just hope for it to be over. No, no no, no no you do not share toothbrushes because you can swap bacteria. When you kiss someone. When you share a toothbrush, all those different things you literally are interchanging bodily fluids and saliva and within the saliva is a transfer of that bacteria. A lot of the times we even tell expecting moms or moms who just had a child. Their oral hygiene has to be on point because what ends up happening is if they ride. Oral hygiene is poor. They could transfer though that bacteria to their child. You know when they take the bottle and they test it with their mouth, they can transfer all that. So it's same thing goes for when you're using a toothbrush. Whatever your boyfriend has in his mouth and he has a lot of cavities and you transfer it and you use it, it's going to you. What's the best way to whiten your teeth? Best way to whiten your teeth is to go to your dentist. Let them know that you're interested in doing that and they can get you bleaching trays. There are over the counter products that you can use Crest white strips. It's cheap, it's effective, a lot of people have different results with that, and that's the easiest way to do it. Press HD wide is pretty good. I also like Sensodyne tree way if people have sensitive teeth I would definitely not recommend the people in the mall by the kiosk because what's happening is a lot of people get themselves in some sticky situations and they come to us afterwards. Try to fix that problem if you're going to do any bleaching, do it under the guidance and care of a doctor. What is the weirdest thing you found in between someone teeth, some fish bones? It's kind of weird 'cause you could feel like a little scaled. I've definitely seen some hair and some patients tape, which I thought that was very weird. You always find food in between someone teeth, no matter how hard they push. Shoes can permanently dye your T anything that's going to stain your clothes will stain your teeth so things that are dark like red wine, coffee, tea, spaghetti sauce, things like that, smoking and like that's something that will also stand teeth as well. And that's a little bit more obvious just because of where it is. You can drink with a straw if it's something like an ice coffee or iced tea. And the other thing I recommend is just rinsing with water afterwards. Why does orange juice taste disgusting after brushing your teeth? Toothpaste heilbrun ingredient called sodium lauryl sulfates or SLS, and what that does is it will bind to this week. Collectors that are in your taste buds on your tongue, so it's kind of blocking any type of sweetness that you would have with an orange from reaching your taste buds, so you can't perceive that it's sweet are biting your nails bad for your teeth? Yes, definitely. If it's something that you're doing daily, you definitely will start to see some little indentations in the teeth. Well, when you have a lot of chips on your teeth, the teeth do get weaker when you have weak enamel, it's gonna chip even more, so biting your teeth is gonna make that worse. If you don't have insurance, what's the best way to have your teeth examined? One go to. Local residency program or two. Going to a dental school. Usually what you'll find is they have reduced dental prices and sometimes even if you go to a local private office and you know discuss it with the doctor, they may be able to negotiate some fees with you and work with you to get you on a payment plan. How do you feel about charcoal toothpaste? I wouldn't recommend it because it is very abrasive and it can cause wear and tear to the enamel and that can cause your teeth to be sensitive. Overtime there's really no scientific based evidence on the effectiveness and the safety of charcoal toothpaste that is a trend that that I would say don't follow. Or you can follow it and then come see me. And then I'll professionally whiten your teeth. Would you recommend at home teeth straightening? No, I would definitely recommend that. You only do that under the care and guidance of a dentist in a dental office. It's just like anything else you into your own eye surgery, so why would you wanna straighten your teeth? Sometimes it could be very dangerous if you have a lot of bone loss. There are a lot of cases you know where people come back and they're losing teeth or teeth are shifted in the wrong direction. Teeth are in bone for a reason for protection, so if you're doing that at home on your own without any knowledge of what to do, you could be putting yourself and your teeth at major risk. How often and long should you brush? 2 minutes, 30 seconds in each quadrant of the mouth at least twice a day? Flossing once a day? Should you brush your tongue a yes and why? Because it causes bad breath. You know, and then you end up with this like white coating on top of your tongue and it just doesn't look good if you're not brushing your tongue. It's very easy for bacteria and food. We kind of get trapped in in the top in bacteria causes bad breath, plain and simple. So just remember to brush and floss twice a day and I'll see you in six months."

Americans don't drive up the price by consuming more health care. They don't visit the doctor more than other developed countries:
http://international.commonwealthfund.org/stats/annual_physician_visits/

But the price we pay for that visit - for a procedure - it costs way more:
http://static1.squarespace.com/static/518a3cfee4b0a77d03a62c98/t/57d3ca9529687f1a257e9e26/1473497751062/2015+Comparative+Price+Report+09.09.16.pdf

The price you pay for the same procedure, at the same hospital, may vary enormously depending on what kind of health insurance you have in the US.

That's because of bargaining power. Government programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, can ask for a lower price from health service providers because they have the numbers: the hospital has to comply or else risk losing the business of millions of Americans.

There are dozens of private health insurance providers in the United States and they each need to bargain for prices with hospitals and doctors. The numbers of people private insurances represent are much less than the government programs. That means a higher price when you go to the doctor or fill a prescription.

Uninsured individuals have the least bargaining power. Without any insurance, you will pay the highest price.

Or on Facebook: http://goo.gl/U2g06o","I cannot tell you how obsessed I am with this chart. It shows exactly what is wrong with America's conversation about health care. On one level, you've seen this chart before. It shows health care spending as a share of the economy of a bunch of countries. There's Germany and France and Japan, Canada and oh, there is America. But now I want to add something you haven't seen to this chart. This is how much of that spending in each country is private and how much is public. Here's what's amazing. America's government spending on healthcare on programs like Medicaid and Medicare. In the VA, our versions of socialized medicine. It's about the same size as these other countries. These countries where the government runs the whole healthcare system. And then there's our private spending. It's the private insurance system that makes health care in America so expensive. Conventional wisdom says the government is more expensive than the private sector. It it can't say no, it's corrupt, it's inefficient, it's slow. You want something done right? You give it to the private sector. That is what we here in America all the time. And yet here we are with the biggest private sector spending the most. Why is it free market so bad? At controlling the cost of healthcare in the United States. If you look at the data on physician visits and hospital discharges, you can get rid of 1 theory. Americans don't consume more healthcare than people in these other countries. We don't go to the doctor more than the Germans or the Japanese. In fact, we go to the doctor less. The difference between us and them is that we pay more every time we go to the doctor for everything from an angioplasty to a hip replacement from a C-section to a pain reliever in America, the price for the same procedure at the same hospital. It varies enormously depending on who is footing the bill. The price for someone with public insurance like Medicare or Medicaid is often the lowest price. These groups that cover so many people that the government can demand lower prices than hospitals and doctors, and they get those lower prices. If the doctors and hospitals say you know they lose a ton of business, they lose all those people on Medicare. All those people on Medicaid. But there are hundreds of private insurance companies and they each cover far fewer people than a Medicare or Medicaid, and each one has to negotiate prices with hospitals and doctors on their own. And if you're uninsured. You have even less leverage. Nobody is negotiating on your behalf, so you end up paying the highest price. One study found that most hospitals charge uninsured patients four times as much as Medicare patients. For an ER visit other countries. They don't have this problem. Instead of every private insurance company negotiating with every healthcare provider, there's just this big list. Country, the central government. They go, and they say, if you want to sell to us to all of our people, then here is what you can charge for a check up. Here is what you can charge for an MRI or a prescription for Lipitor, and so then, whether that Bill goes to the heavily regulated. Private insurance companies in Germany or directly to the government like in the UK, each country is telling the doctor or hospital or drug company how much that Bill will be. And because the government controls access to all of the customers, it's an offer that hospitals and doctors and pharmaceutical companies typically can't refuse. I'm going to make him an offer again, refuse in America. The idea is that you'll be a consumer that you'll do what you do when you go to Best Buy and buy a television, but that just doesn't work in health care. It doesn't work in health care because you often come get health care when you're unconscious in an ambulance when you're scared when it's for your spouse or your child, it is a time when you have the least bargaining power. You are not usually capable of saying no. You're not knowledgeable enough to do it. You're not comfortable doing it, or you're not conscious enough to do it. That's why in other countries the government is a person who can say no. Or you can say no, that's too expensive. You're gonna have to lower your price because they do have that power. A new push for single payer healthcare right here in the US. California and others are saying maybe we should adopt the European model. If we decided to create a single payer system with one of these huge prices in the US, there'd be nothing to stop lobbying from hospitals from doctors from drug companies, and those prices would get influenced so we could end up with a single payer system that is expensive even as expensive as our current system. It all depends on how much you negotiate down the prices. And now in America these groups have so much power because they are so rich that it's really hard to get them to bring down the prices. This is the irony of American healthcare. It's so expensive that it's become hard to make it cheaper all that money they make. That becomes political power and years and years and years of overpaying. Those are huge industries now and they have a lot of influence in Congress. Under a single payer system, if we did drive prices down doctors and hospitals, they would be paid less than they are right now. That might mean some of them close or some go out of business or some move. It would be really painful. One person's waste is another person's essential service or local hospital or their income. But then single payer. It's not an all or nothing choice. For instance, if there's a really interesting section of Bernie Sanders Medicare for all bill relays out this interim plan, it's a plan he wants way setting up his new single payer system. And in that plan, he expands Medicare to cover vision and dental. When he opens it to nearly everyone, not just people 65 and older, all kids go on Medicare automatically and most adults can buy in that plan on its own. It wouldn't get American health care spending far down overnight, but it would at least begin to recognize what we already know and what most other countries already do.

Will a fourth COVID vaccine dose being needed to fight the virus? US health regulators are looking closely at this and hinted that a second booster shot might be recommended later this year. Joining us is our Chief health editor, Doctor Partha Nandi Dr. Nandi with our COVID-19 numbers continuing to drop. Why is a fourth dose being discussed? And there's still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to the coronavirus, right? Well, COVID numbers are still looking much better here in the US there couple key things that health officials need to keep a close eye on. 1st are the new variants that could pop up like like Omicron Sub variant BA2. Now BA2 may be spreading slowly in the US fine compared to the original owner crown, but it's become the dominant. It's variant in countries like Denmark and we can't ignore the fact that hospitalizations and deaths in that country have since increased, which is. Not good news. The other key factor we need to watch is our vaccines, vaccination and booster shots really help bring our numbers down when fighting global crown right? But new research has shown that the booster shots can decrease in effectiveness with time. Right now Pfizer studying a fourth dose in older conspecific vaccine for folks aged 18 to 55. We may or may not need this 4th dose, but research will definitely guide the decision which is I think really important to understand. Plus it's important that we're prepared for what may come next. Doc a fourth dose is available already to certain people right now. When might a fourth dose be available to everyone if this goes through? That's right Brian. Back in October, the CDC updated its recommendations. They allowed folks that are moderate to severely immuno compromised, meaning that they have a weakened immune system to get a fourth dose of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. And the reason why is this research showed that these people had a poor response to the initial vaccine series and that increased their risk of severe COVID-19 and even death. As for when a fourth, those might be available for the vessel. General public. I'm hearing that it could be offered in the fall. Also proved right now. You know, I feel a lot of vaccines are working well in booster. Shots are still offering high protection, so once again I stress the importance of getting vaccinated and then boosted. If you have not already done so. And if you haven't been vaccinated, please make sure that you're following all the precautions necessary to save yourself and your community. Dr Nandi is always grateful for you lending us your expertise. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day you too. And if you have a question for the good doctor, you can email him Doctor Nandi ask Doctor nandi.com. Or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter."

#Coronavirus #COVID-19 #Virus

COVID-19 is the short name for the disease known as novel coronavirus disease 2019. Coronaviruses are a large group of similar viruses. Some are known to infect humans, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The one that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. All coronaviruses are named for the crown-like “spikes” that cover their surface, called spike, or “S,” proteins. Inside the virus, genetic material, called RNA, is made up of genes. Genes carry the information to make more copies of the virus. The virus can infect you if it enters your mouth, nose, or lungs. Inside your body, the S protein of the virus locks to a receptor on the surface of one of your cells. This can trigger the virus to enter the cell in a couple of ways. It may cause the virus to fuse with the cell surface, then release its genes into the cell. Or, the cell may pull the virus inside by enclosing it in a sac. Once inside, the virus can fuse to the sac and release its genes. Next, the genes use a structure in your cell, called a ribosome, to make new copies of the virus. The new viruses travel to the surface of the cell. There, they can leave to infect more cells. In the meantime, viral S proteins left on the surface of the infected cell can cause it to fuse with nearby healthy cells, forming a giant cell. This may be another way for the virus to spread between cells. People may be infected with COVID-19 for two to fourteen days before symptoms appear. The three main symptoms of COVID-19 are: a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include: tiredness, body aches, stuffy nose, sore throat, diarrhea and vomiting, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. Most people have a mild illness and can recover at home. Some people who have the virus may not get sick at all or may show no symptoms. But, if you have trouble breathing, or any other symptoms that are severe, call your doctor or the emergency room. They will tell you what to do. For most people who have the virus, the risk for serious illness is thought to be low. People sixty-five years and older may have a higher risk for serious illness. And, people of any age may be at high-risk if they have underlying conditions, such as: chronic lung disease or asthma; serious heart conditions; diabetes; severe obesity; chronic kidney disease, and liver disease. High-risk groups also include people with a weakened immune system, including: those on certain medications, such as corticosteroids;  people in cancer treatment; and those with HIV or AIDS.  Even if you aren’t in a high-risk group, it’s important to practice social distancing, which means keeping at least two meters, or six feet, between you and other people. This helps prevent infections and serious illness in others as well as yourself. For up-to-date information about COVID-19 and other ways to prevent its spread, visit the CDC website.

I'm showing you how to make a protein shake, but not just any protein shake guys, we're gonna be making the best protein shake you're ever going to make in your entire life. Alright, so that might be a little bit of an exaggeration, but this protein shake is a really good guys. It's so good. I've been making it two times a day everyday for the past five days a week. It's been a lot I've been making it so much that I've considered making it three times in a day and after I have it twice in a day. I'm still craving chocolate. I think I'm totally becoming like. Addicted to chocolate. So just an FYI. Warning if you make this thing you might become addicted to it like I've been the past week. Anyways, let's hop over to the kitchen and I'll show you guys how to make this thing alright guys. So the first ingredient you're going to need for your protein shake is milk and I'm going to be going with vanilla unsweetened almond milk at my shake. Just 'cause the macros are awesome on Allman milk, especially the unsweetened kind. This only has 30 calories per cup and also because I'm lactose intolerant so I can't handle. Regular milk, but if you can drink regular milk or you want to use any kind of milk, coconut milk, rice milk, whatever kind of milk you want to use, use it. You do, you just don't use water before you go any further. Guys, I just want to let you know that this recipe is for like a 50 ounce per massive protein shake and I'm sure a lot of guys out there are not going to want to make a shake as big as this. So just cut the recipe in half. Cut the recipe in a third. I guess if you like big shakes this is right up your alley. We are big shake buddies. We are 50 ounce friends. There's something else. I'm sure there's another good catch phrase. If you got one, let me know in the comments below, but just make this work for your macros and kind of your preferences in terms of amount of shake that you like to make. So for my shake I'm going to add 2 cups of vanilla unsweetened almond milk to my blender. You're also going to need a banana guys, one medium sized banana. I highly, highly recommend using a frozen banana. But my problem is is that I eat all of the frozen bananas before I can put them in my protein shake 'cause I have no self control. So if you have self control, freeze your banana and then put in your protein shake. It's just way more delicious. But we're going to be adding one medium sized banana to this protein shake as well. So the next ingredient guys is protein powder. We're making a protein shake. We need protein powder and be adding a scoop of ice appears low carb chocolate protein powder to my protein shake. I love this stuff. I think it's so delicious and the macros are really awesome. But whatever protein powder you go with. Use a scoop or about 30 grams of chocolate protein powder. So at this point guys, I am going to add even more chocolate to my protein shake. I'm gonna be adding about 3 tablespoons of some unsweetened cocoa powder to the shake. I just love a super rich, super chocolaty super caffeinated because there's caffeine in the cocoa powder and I definitely get a boost from it. Shake. And if you don't want as much chockley you don't want as much richness to your protein shake. Just add a little less 'cause you don't have to add as much as I'm doing but just so you guys know. I'll be adding about 15 grams of the unsweetened cocoa powder to my shake today. So at this point guys, what I like to do is add a little liquid sweetener to my protein shake. I like liquid Splenda, but if you want to use liquid stevia you totally could do that or you don't have to use any liquid sweetener at all. You've added extra banana, or maybe your protein powder. Sweet enough where you don't even have to add anything extra. It's going to be sweet enough as it is. I doubt it though, but what I will say is I just like these 0 calorie sweeteners to speed up my protein shake, but I'll be using about a teaspoon of two teaspoons. Of liquid sweetener in my shake today. At this point you can get out some ice and I like my shakes super thick and super creamy so I'll be adding around a cup and a half to two cups of ice to my protein shake. Alright, so once you've got all the ice in the blender, just pop the top on and blend until your protein shake gets super thick. Super Creamy and super smooth guys. Alright guys so we've got that rich creamy consistency to our protein shake and check out how big this protein shake is. 50 ounces we're ready for the final ingredients. Let's add them into our protein shake. And finish this thing off. I know some of you guys are totally going to think I'm weird for this, but the next ingredient I'm adding to the protein shake is going to be some uncooked old fashioned oats and you want to add it in in this step of the process and not in the beginning because you grind up all the oats and the reason why I like to add it in at the end is 'cause it has little texture to the protein shake. I like to eat my protein shakes with a spoon so in every spoonful I get a little bit of the oats like they're not totally ground up. You get some oats and just as this great texture this Odie nutty flavor to your protein shake. Don't knock it until you try it guys and the final ingredient we're adding into the shake guys is going to be some of these lilies. Chocolate chips if you haven't tried this yet, they are amazing guys. They're like 25% less calories than normal chocolate chips. They're sweetened with urethral and stevia. There's no added shipping these, they are amazing all my rescues lately that have had chocolate chips in them, and then these chocolate chips, and I've just been obsessed. So if you haven't had these yet, you want to pick them up, I'll put a link in the video description below for you to grab some, but just like the oatmeal. You want to add your chocolate chips in at the end of making your shake because you don't want to grind up all of the chocolate chip crunchy goodness. You just want to grind up a little bit of it. That way every bite you get a tiny bit of crunchy chocolate chip morsel in that bite, and it's just it's so good. But I'll be adding one serving or about 15 grams of the chocolate chips to my protein shake. And once you've added those ingredients, just pop the top back onto your blender and give it a quick blend. Guys, just until they disappear into the shake itself, shouldn't be anything too long. And then you are. All set and ready to enjoy your shake. Our show damn good. Oh my gosh, you have a brain freeze, brain freeze, brain freeze. Oh it hurts so good. Anyways, guys, that is today's protein shake recipe. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you give this a shot. If you do, do I have chocolate? Do I have like a milk chocolate mustache? If you do let me know how it goes for you in the comments below. If you like today's video, hit the thumbs up button that helps the video a ton guys if you're not subscribed yet. Subscribe macros full recipe in the video description below along with. All the stuff that I used to make the shake today. You can grab all that stuff in the video description. So thank you so much for hanging out with me a little bit today. I'll see you guys in the next video. Cheers to a delicious protein shake."

Now, cases are continuing to rise and the question on everyone's lips is... what now?

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

#BBCNews #Covid","Here in the UK, a new stage of the pandemic began when Boris Johnson said this in July. We'll move away from legal restrictions and allow people to make their own informed decisions about how to manage the virus. The plan was clear. In England, there would be no rules requiring masks, social distancing, ventilation in schools, or vaccine passes for restaurants. Instead, the emphasis was on the UK's vaccine rollout on personal responsibility. On accepting that we must learn to live with the virus three months on. This is how it's going this week. The UK recorded its highest number of daily infections. It's mid July and it's far higher than any of these major European countries and as case numbers rise the UK Government says there isn't a reason to change tack at the moment. It's sticking with what it calls plan. A vaccines are central to that plan, but they're also central to understanding why infections are going up. It starts with the speed of the UK vaccine rollout. It had one of the fastest starts in the world and that start is a factor now. At the start of this year we, I think we're sort of patting ourselves on the back for how fast the UK's rollout of vaccines was going. That's actually, ironically, become a bit of a problem for us now, because what it means is that we have this issue of waning immunity. The point being that immunity wanes over time. Here we see immunity a month after vaccination, and then after several months now waning, immunity can be addressed with booster jabs, but right now millions of eligible people haven't had one. And then there's children in September, the UK decided to vaccinate children aged 12 and over, but many other countries started far sooner and all of this means the government's handling of the vaccine rollout is now under attack. The booster program is stalling with charities describing it as a chaotic failure only around 13% of children have actually been vaccinated. His wall of defense is falling down at just the point that vaccination is waning well, as we're hearing, the government would refute that characterization. But it is true that the rate of vaccinating children, the rate of boosters and waning immunity, are all factors. When we look at the rising case numbers, and that's not all social distancing. And masks are relevant to indoor socialising in the UK. It's pretty much at full tilt. Scotland and Wales recently introduced vaccine passports for some large venues, but in the rest of the UK they're not needed. As for masks were in Scotland, they're legally required in some circumstances. In England, the government doesn't require them, though some local authorities do on public transport. In reality, though, it's patchy go on the underground in London, you'll see lots of people without masks that contrast with say. Germany, where masks are legally required in some places and uses high and the Labour Party thinks there's a lesson here. Is it too much to ask really to ask someone on the crowded bus or tube to wear? Wear a mask? But also why you know forcing people to go back to work or ending any social distancing and ending advice about ventilation? All of these mitigations have been maintained on the continent. Their levels are now a fraction of hours. The data on the impact of mask wearing on the UK right now though. It is far from straightforward. There is of course large scale research showing masked reduced transmission, but as John Burn Murdoch of the FT notes data suggests right now, they're not a major driver of case numbers in a long Twitter thread he posted. If you're encouraging, or at least not discouraging, lots of big crowded indoor mixing, you'll get more transmission masks or no masks, and we know that despite some policy differences across the Four Nations, including some mandatory mask wearing, we're seeing similar COVID patterns. For all of the UK and those patterns are leading some NHS leaders to call for a range of measures to be brought back. They say it's time for the government Plan B. We are saying it is at risk and we need to take measures now. Measures like wearing masks in crowded places, avoiding unnecessary indoor meetings, working from home if you can. The government though doesn't agree with changing tack at this point, but listen to this from Sajid Javid there are many more things that we can all do to help contain the spread of this virus. Like you know, beating outdoors where it's possible and if you can only meet indoors, letting in fresh air like wearing a face covering in crowded enclosed spaces. This advice raised eyebrows as Mr Javid, and his Conservative colleagues don't wear masks in the House of Commons, but that plays into the government's emphasis on personal responsibility on individuals taking their own decisions. The question is whether that approach, along with an emphasis on the vaccine will be enough to keep the virus at a sustainable level for the NHS. Well, here's the rate of hospitalizations in the UK through the pandemic. It's rising, but this is nowhere near the 1st or the 2nd wave of COVID. But there are risks here. Is this probably the first season where we will have significant amounts of COVID circulating as well as flu? People's behaviors have changed. We're mixing more. Winter weather is coming along. Everybody going into enclosed spaces, and if this winter is a bad flu season, it'll make the UK particularly vulnerable to rising COVID hospitalizations and look at this chart. The UK has fewer hospital beds per person than Spain, Italy, France and Germany. Now that lack of capacity is not caused by COVID. That's a far broader discussion about how healthcare works in the UK, but COVID can apply pressure to that capacity, and as we consider these differing analysis of what to do with the UK's current situation, here's a word of caution on being too definitive at the moment, it's not clear whether what we're seeing at the moment will continue to increase as we move towards Christmas, or as some modelers have suggested, actually will peak sometime this month and then start declining. What is more certain is that the UK Government strategy rests almost entirely on vaccines. And that's not what the World Health Organization is recommending. WHI's position is that we can't only rely on vaccination at the moment to suppress the virus. Since July, though, that is almost exactly what England has done. Life in many ways has gone back to normal with the benefits that brings and the rise in cases that brings. And now with the NHS warning that a tough winter is coming, so to a tough decisions for the government, it believes that for now vaccines alone can work. This winter will reveal if that's right."

VIRAT KOHLI ANGRY MOMENTS in CRICKET compilation","239 bit of a blow up during the over. Who's coming in to have a bit of a chat? Real words. In between the over and I think Warner and Carly have had some. Action throughout the series when it comes to a little bit of sledging and Ricky Ponting in there just to try and count it down. It's a moment that Carla needs to stay focused with. Somehow Warner is inflamed the situation, but good on Ricky Ponting. In the end. Paste well deserved blood fly. Deserve it. Is going to get back for two. As you'd expect, he's fired up. That's a terrific handle. His first in Test match, Gregory. Sponsored Aminos talking about the MCG and no love loss between Kohli and Faulkner. Here's a reminder. Oh boy. Wasting. I smashed enough in my life. No point. He's gonna smash you. Is that kind of Indian batsman who loves to give it back to the opposition bowlers of fielders? It is more mature and that's it. Fast asleep back there. That's brilliant. That's brilliant for Virat Kohli. He was just trying to work it in the lakeside again. Turn the face in the back just too early and chips and easy cash to Virat Kohli who's really fired up. And he's unable to talk us through that. Going forward, here are your hearts a chance late? But it is Antonio Pakora who slides in for the challenge, and there we have with familiar, angry face of Virat Kohli who wanted a booking who wanted a penalty there. I recommend to see that again. You see, they both six against half dozen initially and goes down. We have to look at another angle if we could, but referee deems he's got the ball cleanly. And that's where it will end. We are into the final minute of this game. Voting stoppage time but Cal Rahul Raj is off. He found the back of the net tonight. Candyall heart find a late winner here. Can they put one over the All Stars Football Club? They won the previous encounter 4 three last time around. Virat throws it in a chance. To find the cross, but he's been taken down very hard and the flag goes up. The whistle goes and it will be a free kick. OK, but that's on the ground. It hasn't been. In real time it looked up alcoholic, put the ball away Joe, she catches him. I don't know what he was on about. He's got a long test series ahead of him, Miracle he doesn't want any from this is been a long season, gets up that's good to see Abhishek Bachchan once again running right there. To make sure that. Cali is alright and not only is she alright? He wants me to support as we come to a close here at Mumbai, he's going to take the free kick in sales of the right foot seems fine. It goes. At the receiving end, such injury of the referees decision puts it away, and with that it has ended at 90 minutes to to watch an entertainment. What an entertaining game we've had, and so this has been worth talking on because it's been entertaining stuff from both sides. Absolutely rock. It's been a fabulous evening here. The stars have come out to play at the Mumbai Sports Arena at the end Airy Sports Complex and at the final whistle, it's two to the old Stars Football Club and two to the All Hearts. Football club from Virat Kohli. Still unhappy with that last challenge from Antonio Bucoda. It's been a phenomenal night, Antonio Bucoda. One of the goals scorers tonight. Should you serve car? Was the man that opened the scoring in the first half with a fine header? And it's just been a great time tonight that all of us here will remember in Mumbai. Yeah, you opened the scoring in the ninth minute children. Sircar doubled it. Then they all start through Antonio Pecora and the 36th minute blunder that gave you rushing an opening before halftime. And then a wonderful strike in the last 10 minutes. Gayle Rahul securing the equalizer."

What can the World Health Organization do to compel China to come clean about what happened in Wuhan? And if the World Health Organization cannot persuade China to be open and transparent? Who can? Thank you for the question. I may just remind you that The Who doesn't have the power to compel anyone in in this regard or in in in in other regards and in that sense WHO does not have the power to investigate or enter countries without the express permission and cooperation of that country. That is the basis on which the organization is established in its constitution. It's a Member state organization. And in that sense, 194 Member States agree on the rules. So from that perspective, WHO's no powers to compel what we do is we work through cooperation. We work through consensus and that has worked extremely well for WHO in in polio education. In smallpox eradication, in dealing with multiple multiple outbreaks and emergencies that occur every year, we get remarkable cooperation from most vast majority of countries. In engaging in outbreak investigations and outbreak response and emergency response, we will continue to work with all parties, especially in the case of COVID origins. It is very, very important that the world understands what the origins of of SARS Co V2 was. It is important for now. It's important for the future in terms of preventing further pandemics. It is not always easy to determine that for many many other diseases it has taken years. Of study in order to be able to even understand the basics of that. So it is not an easy task and we will continue in the second phase to propose the necessary studies to take our understanding and knowledge to the next level."

Also known as MSG Quacks, Connection between his headache and this common seasoning in American Chinese cuisine. It was just a hunch, but his letter would dramatically change the world's relationship with MSG. Inspiring international panic, biased science and sensationalist journalism for the next 40 years. So what is this mysterious seasoning? Where does it come from? And is it actually bad for you? MSG is a mixture of two common substances, sodium, which is well established as an essential part of our diet and glutamate. A very common amino acid found in numerous plant and animal proteins. Glutamate plays a key role in our digestion, muscle function and immune system around the time of Doctor Kwak's letter, it had been identified as an important part of our brain chemistry. Our body produces enough glutamate. For all these processes, but the molecule is also present in our diet, you can taste its signature savory flavor in foods like mushrooms, cheese, tomatoes and broth. Chasing this rich flavor is what led to MSG's invention in 1908, a Japanese chemist named Doctor Ikeda Kick in. I was trying to isolate the molecule responsible for a unique flavor. He called umami, meaning a pleasant savory taste. Today, umami is recognized as one of the five basic tastes in food science. Each basic taste is produced by unique molecular mechanisms that can't be replicated by combining. Other known tastes. In the case of umami, those mechanisms arise when we cook or ferment certain foods, breaking down their proteins and releasing amino acids like glutamate. But I kinda found a savory shortcut to producing this chemical reaction by isolating high quantities of glutamate from a bowl of noodle broth and combining them with another flavor enhancer like sodium. He created a seasoning that instantly increased the umami of any dish. The result was a major success by the 1930s, MSG was a kitchen staple across most of Asia, and by the mid 20th century it could be found in commercial food production. Worldwide, so when Doctor Kwak's letter was published, the outrage was immediate. Researchers and citizens demanded a scientific inquiry into the popular additive. On one hand, this wasn't unreasonable. The substance hadn't been tested for toxicity and its health impacts were largely unknown. However, it's likely many people weren't responding to a lack of food safety regulation, but rather the letters title Chinese restaurant syndrome. While MSG was commonly used in numerous cuisines, many Americans had longstanding prejudices against Asian eating customs, labeling them as exotic or dangerous. These stigmas fueled racially biased journalism and spread fear that eating at Chinese restaurants could make you sick. This prejudice reporting extended to numerous studies about MSG and umami, the results of which were much less conclusive than the headline suggested. For example, when a 1969 study found that injecting mice with MSG caused severe damage to their retina and brain, some news outlets jumped to proclaim that eating MSG could cause brain damage. Similarly, while some studies reported that excess glutamate could lead to problems like Alzheimer's. These conditions were later found to be caused by internal glutamate imbalances unrelated to the MSG we eat. These headlines weren't just a product of prejudice. Reporters throughout the late 60s and early 70s. Many doctors also considered Chinese restaurant syndrome to be a legitimate ailment. Fortunately, today's MSG researchers no longer see the additive in this discriminatory way. Recent studies have established the vital role glutamate plays in our metabolism, and some researchers even think MSG is a healthier alternative to added fat and sodium. Others are investigating whether regular consumption of MSG could be linked to obesity and it is possible that bingeing MSG produces headaches, chest pains, or heart palpitations for some people. But for most diners, a moderate amount of this savory seasoning seems like a Safeway to make life a little tastier. From restless nights to afternoon sluggishness the food you eat has a pretty big impact on your life. Learn what food is doing to your brain with this video."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIHZZMDp7uI,Why Christian Church Failed in India to Convert Hindus?,"India, Christian Church, Christianity, Bible, Conversion, Hindus, Sikhs

One of the basic concepts in Christianity is the Original Sin. Christians claim that Jesus died for the sins of others. But the entire Crucifixion story of Jesus Christ makes no sense at all. How can we inherit original sin from Adam? Why blame us for something we didn't do? That's not justice, and the Bible agrees: ''Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin'' (Deut. 24:16). So the story of Jesus Christ contradicts the Christian God itself!!!","Not just this, your your position comes from reading the Bible and I have tried to suggest to you that there's no particular reason why you should read the Bible rather than any other holy book which you could get from anywhere around the world. Now we started to talk about Jesus and Jesus is self sacrifice, which you pointed out mirrors that the sacrifice of Abraham's son now. The idea that God could only forgive our sins by having his son tortured to death. As a scapegoat is surely from an objective point of view, a deeply unpleasant idea. If God wanted to forgive us our sins, why didn't he just forgive them? Why did he have to torture? Have his son tortured? That's a very good question. Well, what's your answer, genesis? How does Genesis answer that question? Because Adam was made perfect and what happened through his disobedience. If you like simple test and he lost that perfection for us. For us all as a human race according to Scripture and the need for a Messiah or another perfect being of the same degree of perfection. Could only be the proper ransom for our. Redemption God was in a position to accept any ransom he chose, presumably, why on Earth would he have his son tortured for the sin of somebody who lived? How long before for 4000 years before? If you believe that Adam did because Adam's crumpton Apple? Why would that? Sin reverberate down the ages and have to be redeemed by the torturing of God's own sound. Why didn't God say I forgive you? I forgive you, it's I. It's in my part of it, but no, what he said was my son has to be tortured to death just like Abraham. I don't think that was the way. Well, it's certainly not the way I read it, but I see it God love the world so much that he gave his only begotten son that was a ransom quoting scripture again. But why wouldn't God just forgive us if that's what he wanted to do, he could have done it that way, but he chose being the sort the God that he is allowing for us to have free will. And it wasn't just scrumping an apple, there's more to it than that. Adam was plainly disobedient and. I think he even admits it himself in the fact that he hid from God that particular evening, 'cause there was a a fellowship between man and God every day. So Adam was disobedient and that's in reverberated down. The ages is inherited by all humans. What kind of a doctrine is that inherited by all humans and had to be redeemed by the son of God being tortured to death? What kind of a morality are you propagating there? That's a."

The Daily Show with Trevor Noah airs weeknights at 11/10c on Comedy Central.","I have I have some big news for you. America Muslims are everywhere. But the one place you won't find Muslims is in the image behind me. Hassan Minaj has more. Islamophobia. In case you haven't noticed, it's still a big problem in America. Islam hates us. We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods. We better wake up and smell the falafel now as a Muslim living in the United States, I've learned how to deal with it. I just act super white like a brown Ryan Seacrest. But what about those people who look Muslim but aren't like Sikh American, Waris Ahluwalia? He says he was prevented boarding his flight because of his turban. He refused to remove this cherished symbol of his faith, a turban which as a Sikh he wears everywhere. But for some reason it makes people uncomfortable almost every time I fly back to the USI, get a secondary screening, and it's not just a problem at an airport, it's not just a problem for me on the streets, and I'm always wondering why. Why do I get? Profile I think it's the whole. Yeah, people assume that Sikhs are Muslims, and that's primarily an issue because Sikhs are an independent religion. I know that and I'm sure you know what Americans probably know that too. Don't don't don't sell them short. They know a lot more than you think. What is what a seek a seek seek. I have no idea Sir, I'm gonna make this easy here we go. Which one of these is a Sikh a Sikh? Yes, I seek. That one right there, Jesus Christ, I am showing you a photograph of a bird, binoculars, a child playing hide and go seek and a man in a turban and a beard. Maybe it's the kids playing hide and seek. I'm gonna go with birds. Sir. Wores was right, they don't know. OK, America Sikhs are a standalone religion that started here. There are 30 million of them worldwide, almost a quarter million in America and men wear turbans as a sign of commitment to their faith. But his worse alone in his struggles against bigotry. I've been called ISIS a lot recently, American 2C6 on medically Dengler terrorist. The turbine is what makes us the target exactly, so just take it off. Problem solved. The turbine is part of my religion. It's part of my faith. It represents who I am, what I believe in the values that I hold dear and true. And those values are seek those values are American. That's all great, but I'm just gonna be honest with you. Here's all Americans care about other religions number one. Do you drink beer? #2? Do you eat pork #3? Will you blow it up? That's it. I eat pork. I love bacon. Great, see, now we're making progress, but can we make him even less threatening to white people? Americans love the silver screen. Maybe go to Hollywood getting some movies. I am in movies no, I mean movies that why people watch. I'm in West Anderson movies. OK, those are white movies, really white movies. He's standing next to frigging Jason Schwartzman. And yet he's still an outsider in his own country. I'm an artist. I'm I'm making movies. I'm I'm designing. I'm trying to live my life. I do things just like you, right? And just like everybody else, I got. It seeks. They're just like us. We pay 5 bucks for magazines that show us celebrities doing chores. So what if we showed how Sikhs are also just like us? They get Starbucks. They pumped their own gas. They rock scarves while crossing the street. Some even eat pork really. You eat pork? Yeah no. Or there's an even easier way. Why don't you just go hey? I'm not Muslim, it's just not an option for us to throw another community under the bus, even if it means things are harder for us. We believe it's the right thing to do, like we need to be better than that as Americans and that's what our sick values teach as well. Come on, I'm Muslim, but believe me, I work really hard at blending in a third of my salary goes to New Balance in Patagonia. Come on, I mean, even Barack Obama was like, hey? I'm not a Muslim look, I can't hide it. If I were you I would throw me under the bus so fast. That's not the way I was raised. That's why I wear this turban as a reminder to myself to treat humanity with care and kindness. So that's so I'm I'm not here to point fingers exactly. See it's not about finger pointing. It's more of a hey look over there. It's not a finger thing, it's more of a head thing. Son, you need to lead with love. I like that. Now how do we scare people into believing that I had to show him how easy life on the road could be with a little role play? You're the TSA agent. I'm you great. Hello Sir, may I see your boarding pass? Certainly I am so glad you're here to protect us from Muslims because I am not Muslim. See how easy that was. I am on the plane before you can say hey stop that brown guy I got my carry on up top. We are taking off when you do this. You're part of the problem. But I'm also on the plane. You're also then only thinking about yourself, and that's the American way. So remember seeks, you're living in America, and if you really want to fit in, always lookout for number 1."

About The Daily Show:
Trevor Noah and The Daily Show correspondents tackle the biggest stories in news, politics and pop culture.

The Daily Show with Trevor Noah airs weeknights at 11/10c on Comedy Central.","Donald Trump has assembled a wide range of supporters at the RNC and some of the most vocal evangelicals. Yes, he's a casino owner who's had three different wives, but the conservative Christians know a devout man when they see one. He represents the godly people of the United States of America is always acted like a good Christian. Absolutely yeah. How can you build that kind of empire if you're not praying to God for good things every day? He is the man for this time in history and God will use him and I don't know that he's going to even be aware of how God is going to use him. You like he even knows what his relationship with God is. Absolutely, I think that they seem convinced, but I was still struggling to see how this man reflected the teachings of the good book. What do you think about the idea of loving thy neighbour? You don't want somebody living next door to you. That's going to sneak over and murder you in your sleep. Who's gonna do that? Muslim, but then I saw a man who could convince even the most skeptical of the depth of Trump's faith. We are electing a man in Donald Trump who believe in the name of Jesus Christ. Pastor Mark Burns, shouting. That's the guy I needed to talk to. The man who gave the benediction on the opening night of the RNC. I believe Donald Trump without question loves God. He believes in the one true God. He believes Jesus Christ is his Lord and savior. He believes that marriage is between one man and one woman. He believes that way. What he believes marriage is between one man and one woman who does, Donald Trump believes one marriage between one man and one and one. He also believes younger woman comes along. I don't think marriage is between one man and one Czech 1 Slovenian and one American right? So your point is. This one man, one woman thing. I ran the numbers. They don't check out OK, so he stumbled a few times on his path towards righteousness. But surely he embodies the most basic Christian ideal of helping those in need. Jesus said blessed are the poor, for they will inherit the Kingdom of heaven. He did. Indeed, Donald Trump said I've watched politicians bragging about how poor they are, how poor their parents and grandparents were, and I said to myself if they can stay so poor for so many generations, how smart can they be? They're morons, Donald Trump is not the pastor of the United States of America. He's accepted Jesus Christ as his savior. Is he a seminarian student? Can he execute the scriptures? I don't think so. You know who has run a Bible study? I'll give you a hint. It rhymes with Hillary Clinton. Killing. Yes, runs a Bible study she did when she was First Lady of Arkansas. Well, you know, I can't speak to Hillary Clinton's relationship with God. I know she's really good at pandering after black churches singing. Whatever Amazing Grace song she can come up with for that moment. Do you think Donald Trump knows the words to Amazing Grace? I think it would be more like tremendous grace how fantastic the sound could save a pretty good guy like me. I once was lost. Or you know what? I was never lost. I was born with an impeccable sense of direction when it comes to Trump views on the poor and marriage. Christians are willing to turn the other cheek and attitude they extend to all God's children. Well, almost all. I think that when Hillary Clinton calls Donald Trump a person that does disrespects women. For a woman herself to allow her husband to disrespect her, I think that's horrible. You're holding that to Hillary. What we saw is what we received. So what's worse, Hillary allowing Bill to cheat or Donald Trump cheating? Well I wanna I wanna be clear. I said really loud. You don't want to do anything. Bill is all man, but you're connecting his actions to Hillary. But because he is Hillary Clinton's husband, you're not connecting Donald Trump's actions to Donald Trump. Just like any of us wanna be followed, we fall to us in I see Christians love to forgive and Donald Trump allows them to practice forgiveness and truly biblical proportions. Amen."

Miffed by the diplomats, Imran said that Pakistan is not West's 'slave' while addressing a rally in Pakistan's Punjab province. He hit out at them for pressurising them and not India. Imran has said that Pakistan had supported NATO in the Afghanistan war and suffered the loss. This comes after Pakistan's abstention on the UNGA resolution against Russia.

No such new crisis in Pakistan, though it is grappling with old ones. Terror attacks have not stopped. Neither have anti government protests, nor Pakistan's obsession with India. Life as usual there on Friday pay shower was hit by a suicide bomb attack. 57 people died, 194 were injured on Saturday. Anti government protests were reported in Lahore and Islamabad. Below chapter Vists demonstrated over the disappearance of their friends and family. Then came Sunday, Prime Minister Imran Khan held a roadshow near Multan. Why, perhaps because he felt like it? What did he talk about? Not the attacks and pay shower. Not the protest by Baluchis, but the ongoing war in Ukraine. What's that got to do with Pakistan a lot, says Imran Khan. He says he's under pressure to condemn Russia under pressure, by whom Western countries. Apparently they wanted Pakistan to support a resolution against Russia. This was at the United Nations General Assembly. Reports also say that envoys from 22 Western countries sent a letter seeking Pakistan support. Now, to be clear, it was just a request, not an ultimatum, but Imran Khan has a habit of making a hill out of a mole. It seems. So he made a big fuss about the letter. He said, why don't Western leaders make the same request to India? Listen to what he said. Robin Union ambassador there hot liquor Pakistan ko. GitHub. Rules. Statement there. Major European Union came bassador push down. Get ya. Stan Kobe. You heard him. Did you write to India to ask Imran Khan? Well, it might have and that's how diplomacy works. Countries lobby for each other, support all the time. Sometimes they agree, sometimes they refuse. If it doesn't suit them. What they do not do is use such requests as political weapons in rallies. Plus the West understands and accepts India strategic autonomy. New Delhi has never sided with any power bloc. Not my circus, not my monkeys. That's been India's policy throughout unlike Pakistan, which tends to dance at 2 weddings at the same time. When Russia invaded Ukraine, Imran Khan was in Moscow calling the atmosphere exciting. That's the word he used. It's exciting two days before that his ambassador met. With a senior official from Ukraine and reaffirmed Pakistan support for Ukraine sovereignty. So which side are they on really being a former cricketer and a media personality? Imran Khan would know a thing or two about timing and messaging. You can't be visiting Moscow during the war and not expect the West to corner you. Well, he's accused them of hypocrisy and for treating Pakistan like a slave. I'd like you to listen to him again. Yaa. Hindusthan Sakuraba tetora. He cut the Jared Bunkie. Tahoe Hum aapke samne. Gamble. Good job Danielle, I'm Carla. Let me translate that for you. What do you think of us? Are we your slaves? Well, I have some thoughts on this, but I let the numbers do the talking. Pakistan is America's largest recipient of foreign assistance. In the last one decade, Washington has given Islamabad $7.7 billion in funds, same with the UK. Pakistan is the largest recipient of foreign development aid from the United Kingdom between 2019 and 2020, London gave Islamabad £302 million and these are just two examples. Pakistan has taken aid and loans from every conceivable source in the world. Now when you've taken this kind of money. And not return a single penny. You should not complain about being treated like a slave, and if you do, you better have the bank balance and the political will to return the money. Unfortunately for Imran Khan, he has neither money or will. For all we know he could be on his way out. Pakistan's opposition has brought a no confidence motion against the Prime Minister they've given Imran Khan a 24 hour ultimatum resign in the next 24 hours or get ousted through a no confidence vote. That's what the opposition says. Why they're so confident when they claim to have the support of 202 lawmakers. Let's break it down to you. 202 is way more than what they need. The National Assembly of Pakistan has 342 seats. Imran Khan plus allies have 177. The opposition has 162. The halfway mark is 172. That's the number you need 172 to dethrone Imran Khan. The opposition says they have more than 200. And if they're right, Imran Khan will lose power. Unless of course the Pakistan Army springs a surprise. It looks unlikely. But remember, this is Pakistan. Nothing should be ruled out. Leon is now available in your country. Download the app now and get all the news on the move."

#Sikhism #Sikhi #SikhHistory #Dharma #GuruNanak #MaharajaRanjitSingh","In a similar fashion, I want to ask you. About Cici and today. Again, we see that it is deliberately separated from sin by certain vested interests. Could you also help us understand how Sikhs and Sikh gurus, when in fact very prominent purveyors of Yes, yes, these are also fairly recent phenomena. So let's go back into kind of the history of the six. First of all, now Nick is also the patron guru of the Hindus of Sindh. He is not just some separative seek figure. Secondly, Guru Nanak Sunsh reach and or Siri Chan has founded the Odaesan order of Hindu swamis. You find him there in Haridwar, Rishikesh. Many of the orders came through that he lived this 8 / 100 years. I think even was I think it was. It was Shah Jahan or one of the mogul Emperor's referred to Sri Chand as the most respected. Guru in India? And so all this again, let's look at the Sikh. They also have karma, rebirth, moksha. They also have yoga practices. Many Sikhs are also involved in Ayurveda. In fact all the Vedic vedang. Traditions and let us go forward a bit to Guru Gobind Singh. He also went to Durga. As 9A Davie in the Himalayas to get his sword. And he was also aligned with the Marathas and the Hindu. Leaders as well encountering and going against the moguls and let us go even further to the last really great independent ruler King Emperor of India was Ranjit Singh. Ranjit Singh also went to places like. Dweller Muckey and Hindu temples. He put the kumkum on his hands before. Going out into battle, so there was not that division there who, Dawson and Swamis and related swami's were at most of the Gurdwara guru Dwars also are vegetarian, so there is a lot of commonality there, and if you see the practices at the gurdwara, they are honoring the book, but they are using a lot of the same practices Hindus used for the Morty and Hindu tradition also honors Veda Shastra. Guitar and I tell you that the book that spired these seeks was also the Bhagavad Gita and the Kurukshetra. So the idea of Sikh is something opposed to the Hindu is not really there historically and in the fight against the British, the Sikhs and Hindus were together seeks also often came out of Vaishnava. Traditions one of the sons became a Sikh siksha. It wasn't necessarily a religious division that you had one religion versus another and look at all the Sikh names. Siri is of course Shree the Sikh names. Guru Murky is closely connected to ancient Indian languages. Sanskrit and it comes from the same basic Kurukshetra and. Haryana Punjab area that Vedas came from as well so we don't need to divide these up again. There can be philosophical differences and we also note that there is this sense among the if we go deeply into the Sikh teachings very much the ragas very much the teachings are connected to. Not only Vedas, mahaabhaarat and then even the mother gurus who came up later on in recent times. And there's no history of a country called Khalistan. Ranjit Singh never created anything called Khalistan and the Sikhs were defending Barrett as a whole and Sikhs are all over India, the agricultural region their way over in UP. They're all over in the country. There was never this sense that they were people who belonged to a place called Khalistan, and even if we look at Punjab Today, it's still almost it's. It's still nearly half. Hindu and the we have the major Sikhs in Delhi we have gurudwaras everywhere so these are all part of what again we can call a Bharatiya Sanskriti and we can have differences. Certainly for the Sophic Lee gurus you can follow you may use more tease. Someone may not argue Samaj doesn't use Mortiz seeks may not use more teas but so much is the same. And commonality should be there and mutual respect audio. Namaste. We hope you enjoyed this chickney media content.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0,Gordon Ramsay's Scrambled Eggs,"Gordon Ramsay, one of the world's most celebrated chefs, invites you to learn his tricks with Cook with Me, the wild-mannered chef's new app, presented exclusively twice a week in The Daily.

The Scottish-born and English-raised chef Ramsay opened his first restaurant at age 31 in London's Chelsea neighborhood. The eponymous restaurant  was awarded three Michelin stars within its first three years. Ramsay  went on to open some of London's most famous restaurants, including the  Savoy Grill and Petrus. In 2003 he went international, expanding in  urban destinations from Tokyo to New York to Los Angeles.

Now Ramsay's bringing the heat directly to your iPad. Try Cook with Me via The Daily.","Breakfast never get a chance to eat it Monday to Friday, but Saturday Sunday, however, is the time when everyone should have a proper breakfast. My perfect breakfast, scrambled egg, sauteed mushrooms and tomatoes. The most important thing about any scrambled egg is stopping from overcooking. Flat cap mushrooms. Just keep them whole and put them in the pan. Lots of olive oil, a little bit of salt, a little bit of pepper vine tomatoes. Best way of roasting these is actually keeping on the vine in the pan with the mushrooms right? Just let those mushrooms tomatoes sit there in the panel, a low heat and they'll cut themselves. Nothing worse than going into a restaurant having scrambled egg on toast and having soggy toast. This here is a sourdough bread, and the reason we're going to use it for scrambled egg is because it's strong, robust and it's got a lovely flavor to it, but be quite generous when you cut it because you don't want this sort of little thin tight sort of fisted slice of bread nice and thick, chunky bread into the toaster every time we get a new cook in the kitchen wheels. Ask them to make scrambled eggs and if they can make the perfect scrambled egg you know they know how to cook properly. Start off with three eggs. Now don't season it, because if you put the salt in now, what actually happens? It breaks down the eggs and it starts turning into something sort of very watery. In the Pan, Nice number butter and it's really important to put the butter in right at the very beginning, because what that does it starts giving a really nice velvety finish. Just scrambled egg and then a simple spatula onto the heat. Never whisk the egg. Whisk it in the pan because when you start sort of whisking beforehand, you're breaking it all down. You gotta break it down in the pan, but the secret behind the scrambled egg is to start it on a nice sort of general heat. Take it off the heat, go back to the heat, take it off the heat. I'm treated like a risotto. You can't stop stirring. It's live, you've got to really work at it now. It's starting to come together. It's starting to go a little bit thick. I come back off the heat and just let it work and just do this three or four times back onto the heat. Now if I had to see this now, it's still. Turn it into something quite watery and I want a really nice sort of creamy scrambled egg, something quite fluffy. Is that my toast burning? Off the heat. Damn damn damn gonna set the fire alarms off that'll wake up the missus. Put that back in so. On and off the heat. Right off the heat. Then as you can see, now look, it's almost starting to sort of, you know, continue, cooking doesn't need to go back on the stove 'cause it's actually continuing cooking because the heat is in there. So look if I had to leave that there now overcook, but it's not going to overcook because I'm going to put half a tablespoon of cream fresh, and what that does now just makes it a little bit cooler. Brings down the temperature of the eggs. Now I'm gonna season it a little bit of salt and then it's a little bit of pepper. Just to finish that I'm just going to put a little touch of chives in there, and what that does, it just lifts the whole flavor of the scrambled egg and just makes it a little bit more sexy. And you know, sometimes you want a bit more travel. You can put some smoke salmon in there. I like points and then just fold those chives in. There we are. Perfect scrambled egg. Serve it. We're ready to go on. On the Vita Matos. That's what we leave on the vine. You see, 'cause you just pick them out the pan like that. Sit them on there. I'm just going to drizzle. I sourdough bread a little bit of olive oil in there and then just pour the scrambled eggs. Over the sourdough bread. And there you go. A perfect scrambled eggs. I mean the most amazing way of waking up this is on a Saturday Sunday morning. So if you want to be a good boyfriend, I've said now and give it to her in bed. The breakfast."

About The Daily Show:
Trevor Noah and The World's Fakest News Team tackle the biggest stories in news, politics and pop culture.

The Daily Show with Trevor Noah airs weeknights at 11/10c on Comedy Central.","Whether seriously or thrown around, as a joke, Boston is often referred to as one of the most racist cities in America, so we decided to send Roy Wood junior up to uncover why Beantown got that Rep Boston. Home to Mark Wahlberg, Donnie Wahlberg. All of the rest of the Wahlberg. It's also home to spotlight. The team of Boston Globe reporters who exposed the city's church sex scandal. I'm here because the spotlight team has been asking another uncomfortable question. How racist is Boston for decades, people have called Boston racist for numerous reasons, the Red Sox were the last baseball team to integrate Bostonians violently resisted desegregation even in 2017, fans at Fenway Park called Adam Jones the N Word and all this. Got Spotlight curious reporter Akilah Johnson, so we wanted to look at why does Boston have the racist reputation and why does it deserve it? How do you measure racism? Well, you do it in a right. How many times the inward is set in a day? You can grow meter. So like in the grammar, no inward no. OK, so one study we found showed that the median net worth of white families in Boston was $247,500. Compare that to the median net worth of black families in Boston, which was $8.00. I counted thousands like $8000, no just 88 dollars $8.00. That's that's not even a Grande soy latte. In essence, net worth is what you own minus what you owe. And black folks in Boston don't own a lot. That's not even enough for a foot long. You know racism is more than just attitude. That's not even enough to buy 12. Don't 11 Donuts. This is one example of what structural racism looks like. I'm sorry. I eat when I get sad. About social inequality. If Boston is the cradle of equality, spotlight wants to know why black enrollment at many of Boston's universities hasn't really gone up in 30 years, or why they're so little diversity in boardrooms and hospitals, or how among eight major cities, black people voted Boston the least welcoming to people of color. Surely the people of Boston must be feeling all that structural racism to find out. I went to one of the city's most beloved cathedrals, Fenway Park. I don't see that racism, myself. Honestly, no, I don't think Boston is a racist city. I think that we've got a lot of like attention with with our sports being in the media. So Boston racist reputation is a conspiracy formed by people who hate Boston sports teams for winning all the damn time. I love to hate us. Yeah, I don't think in Boston is a racist city at all. So how do you know? I don't feel it. You know, it's just a gut feel. I don't feel like it's racist. I've just never encountered it. Spotlight says the city has a race problem. Why haven't these Bostonians seen it? The NAACP is Tanisha Sullivan hasn't theory. The spotlight gave U.S. data to support what black people in and around this city already knew. So if the data was news to you, you called the article the Spotlight article. But if you already knew about it, you just called it. That's what I've been trying to tell y'all. Article because the racism is not as overt. It's difficult for people who don't experience it on a day to day basis to to realize that it's there. But I've been asking the wrong people. If you want to know if Jurassic Park is safe, you don't ask the dinosaurs. It's not as racist as they used to be, but there are some blatant problems. White person walks into a room in Boston to think about that. I'm the only white person here on a scale of jazzy Jeff to Jeff Sessions. How comfortable is it for black people tell me when to stop. Of course. This is Jeff Sessions, right here right there. So about let's say, about 6070% comfortable, not quite. Hey boy, go home, but definitely not your neighborhood. No where you are allowed nowhere you wanted. Let's see to help this city recognize structural racism. Maybe I just need to use the one thing that brings all Bostonians together. Sports, sports, sports. Yeah, it's probably sports teams were winners. What we do, I just need to get this city of champions hyped about finally winning at the one thing they suck at. We're about treat people with respect. City streets, black people the best. It's Atlanta actually and then New York and then San Francisco and then Charlotte and Tampa. And then at the bottom is Boston. With these people really need it was a mascot, so I gave him one introducing and woke. Either walrus who's got the best baseball? Football who's number one in who ain't the system with structurally black people don't always get the same opportunities. Yeah yeah, it's working already. See Boston feels good to be honest. Fighting structural racism is going to be exhausting, but if white people are willing to put in the legwork, we'll get there. Where would you?"

Official Website - https://www.republicworld.com/","Ladies and gentlemen, a minister in Pakistan and Imran Khan's inner circle, PTI leader FiOS Chowdhury has positively and undeniably lost his mind after much braggadocio wanting to face Major Gaurav, Ariana debate. This helpless man has spent a good portion of the last 24 hours fumbling and bumbling for answers and dodging for cover as the Republic Media network in Major Gary accepted his offer for debate while Islamabad stole. Claims and bloated statements are punctured by the might of the people of India so as to fizzle in their own deep seated insecurity. It gives a Republic media network pride to be identified as the enemy of the terror state called Pakistan. This man viewers has unsurprisingly in the past crushed the rights of the citizens in the Pakistani territory in Balochistan, and incited with anti minority statements within Pakistan possibly fulfilling the prerequisites to be the befuddled and dazed Imran Khan's top man. While this is the first time since independence that one Indian media organization has officially become the prime subject of attack by Pakistan, it wholly establishes the trepidation. With which they Imran Khan government functions visa of India the Republic Media Network has sent chills down their spine because they know that with Republic are the mighty people of India and today I want to tell you why Imran Khan government and the ISI losing their sleep over the Republic Media network while government drowned in debt in global irrelevance is spending what little borrowed money it has in its coffers to try and target Republic ladies and gentlemen. We at Republic have torched the facade of a nation. That the terror factory Pakistan masquerades under. We have singed the lies of Pakistan with video proof of the glorious surgical strike in Balakot. We have skewered their deceit with a stunning Balakot proof and we have exposed their terror factories and systems of state collusion and we have snuffed their terror funding by exposing their terror trails and we will do it over and over and over again. And those living and sitting in Islamabad and Howell Pindi listen to me. Yummy. Your insecurities are making you wilt into even more relevance. Your cowardly infiltration tactics. Your cheap talk. You're gutless ceasefire violations and your terror factories have ensured that you are static and motionless. With the passage of time, you are and shall neither be able to fathom nor reach the might, the courage, the fierceness, the bravery, and the resolute unity of Republic and one 30,00,00,000 Indians who stand with it. These Barbarians send their terrorists to spill blood on our soil. And today we pledge as a nation. That every tricolour wrapped coffin returning to a proud home every tear shed and scream of anguish of a loved one. Giving their last salute. And for every proud slogan of Jai hind that roars in the villages, towns and cities of our brave martyrs, we will make Pakistan pay like never before. We are proud at Republic to be identified as enemy number one of Islamabad and therefore we declare Republic versus Pakistan. It's Republic versus Pakistan because those on the side of terror can only be dealt with in one language. It's Republic versus Pakistan because we take pride in firmly standing against the nation whose machinery is constantly prided itself on being a citizen for terrorists and an arm of our bloodshed. And yes, it is Republic versus Pakistan because we don't seek clarifications from those who spilled the blood of courageous Indians from Mumbai to patent court. It's Republic versus Pakistan because we say forces first come what may its Republic versus Pakistan because for us for us it is nation first. India first. Part at first, no compromise."

He made the comments in a televised government meeting just two weeks after the Russian forces invaded into Ukraine. His comments, of course, were designed to reassure the people in Russia that the country can withstand what is now being described as an economic war by the West. On the Russians on their banks, businesses and the oligarchs. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Thursday that Russia would ultimately emerge stronger and more independent after the West imposed what he called illegitimate sanctions, addressing a government meeting. Putin also said Moscow, which is major energy producer, would continue to meet its contractual obligations, and he said that Western sanctions would prove self defeating. Presume that you like pizza. We know it well. They urge their citizens to tighten their belts, dress warmer and point to the sanctions they impose on us as a reason for their deteriorating situation. Catnip ricchiuti. Hitting back against the West, the Russian government said earlier it had banned exports of telecoms, medical, auto, agriculture, electrical and tech equipment, among other items until the end of the year. In total, over 200 items were included on the export suspension list, which also covered railway cars, containers and turbines earlier on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said that Russia's economy was experiencing a shock and that measures were being taken to soften the blow from the. Raft of far reaching sanctions. The situation is totally unprecedented. The economic war that has started against our country has never taken place before. So it is very hard to forecast anything. One needs not to forecast, but to act to minimize the negative consequences and further risks. Person. Regulate the UK sanctioned 7 more oligarchs. It links to the Kremlin on Thursday that follows 14 sanctioned by the EU on Wednesday. Jan is now available in your country. Download the app now and get all the news on the move."

Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry father issued a statement which read and I quote. These individuals, totaling 81 or convicted of various crimes, including murdering innocent men, women and children. The statement also said that crimes committed by these individuals also include pledging allegiance to foreign terrorist organisations. Now put into state news agency. SBA, the latest group, had been tried by 13 judges and gone through a three stage judicial process out of the 81 men executed. 73 of them were Saudi nationals who were found guilty in a single case for attempting to assassinate security officers and targeting police stations and convoys. The latest mass execution in the Kingdom is likely to bring back attention to Saudi Arabia's human rights record. And it comes at a time when the wild powers have been focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, rights groups have accused Saudi Arabia of enforcing restrictive laws on political and religious expression and has been criticised for using death penalty, including for defendants who are arrested when they were minors. However, Saudi Arabia has denied accusations of human rights abuses by father, asserting that it is only protecting its national security through its laws, their wealthy gulf. As one of the highest execution rates in the world, it is ranked fifth in the list compiled by the Amnesty International. The other four countries are China, Iran, Egypt and Iraq.

My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly MY point of view, but is not meant to offend any person or culture.","Today we're visiting one of Asia's most extreme markets about a one hour drive uphill from the city of Manado lies to Mahone and what was once the largest market in the city. Welcome to tomohon market. I'm here with Darlene. Yeah, brother, thank you for joining me today. How long is this market been here? It's been forever like since we know it's only here. Local vendors and local people shopping. Ali has joined to help me get acquainted with the locals in English. Snake fruit in the snake skin comes right off. It's like this fruit has scales on it. It's not so the concept of normal here may be very different from your own, but I'm not traveling here to condemn the local way of life. I'm here to learn more about the Mina has on people of North silhouettes. Can I ask you how do you prepare your bed? Locals here are as playful and jovial as any other market I've been to in Asia. I own nice to meet you, thank you, but even for me, someone who thought he'd seen it all, this place was tough to take in. This is my first time in this market. I notice here a lot of people eating dog. Why do people like dogs but not all locals think alike? People will actually capture the dogs right? Yeah, our dog here two dogs. And that's why I don't like anymore. Welcome to tomohon market. We're entering the market now. We already found something. Yeah, I was like what kind of fruit is this? It has a tail. Is it OK if we film your animals? Oh yes, there's a bamboo. It's a bamboo bamboo. They skewered the rat through its entire body, and it looks like they they roasted it a bit. At least they got their hairs off. I'm going to touch his body. Oh, it's like my grandpa's wrinkled neck. How much is a rat? 25,025 is she charging me the foreigner rat price? No. No, everyone pays up. Where do you get these rats? They got it from the forest from the woods. Why do you sell rats? I'm so curious. Uh. He's just looking for money to put a living to say so. This is just what was most viable for her. She's like I know how to catch rats. I can catch him, took him and tell him she said like she's taking a bit of profit from selling their rats. So good. Have you eaten rat before? I'm not yet. Oh, you haven't ever. I'll give you teaching you a lot. Read probably. Are you willing to try it with you? Yeah, probably there is no such thing as taboo here. If you're squeamish or sensitive, I suggest you stop watching right now. We're heading to the meat market right now. What am I gonna expect to see? We'll fill out of mid on the table I think. Oh wow yeah, Tomohon market likely got its grisly reputation because for many animals it serves as both slaughterhouse and butcher shop. You can see he's kind of butchering a little bit the bad they keep most somebody in tech so he just does a few quick cuts and he just pulls out the bottle. Yeah and they burn it so that their skin their furry. I mean, this tension here is just burnt animal hair. It smells a little disconcerting. It's not the best smell. The cuisine in this region is like nothing I've seen before. Why is he roasting the wings? Other person in the wing area, so we have to get the power off the winter and the odd selection of menu items. Here is the result of the mini has on people never fully becoming an Agricultural Society. Oh that's so huge. How much does this one cost 60? Batman or Robin? You don't want to be the best here. Trust me, we probably don't want to be the Robin either. Without farm raised animals to meet here is largely haunted and caught in the wild. Have you ever had that? Yes, of course you have. What do you mean? Yeah, he's like, ah, I don't eat red, it's like have you had that of course. So instead of pork, there's wild boar. Check this out. He's got no flamethrower. That's a board. Oh, so this one is the board. Not only are they selling fast, but over here they have more. The board is a wild pig basically right? So they catch it also from the woods. All these animals. All this is still so plentiful here, like they're still able to capture board catch these wild bats. And instead of beef, I guess there's bat meat. I'm gonna be honest, I'm a little overwhelmed right now. Oh, I see. There's a lot of different interesting stuff here. Let's keep moving all right. I got this old school kind of scale this much think is how much thousand. It's a $7.00. This is a huge Python can I ask how long have you been working in here doing this? 30 years, 30 years so people can just come up here. Chop off a piece and take it home, huh? Yeah, you're selling Python. You're selling more. Just those two things they have. I do have a serious question. Do they ever worry about some animals being in danger or running or like running out that I'm not complaining about? It's gonna be fine. I mean sometimes animals go extinct within the last year. Some vendors were still selling macaque monkeys because of education, government intervention, and a possible five year jail sentence. It seems to be a thing of the past. A monkey is probably my law. Yeah, so there are still some regulations here around the food. Yes, for some animals. Great, well, I think that's just something important for people to know it be easy to see this kind of market if you're like, oh there, it's just law. They say eat anything. Does he ever get a monkey in here? Still I said that. Oh no more. That's honestly, that's great to hear. Well, thank you so much for your time before leaving. I wanted to hear from a local about some of the more controversial fair. This is my first time in this market. I notice here a lot of people eating dog. Why do people like dogs? Begging you. Yeah, yeah, he said it is quite good. I haven't seen anywhere in the world people are eating cat and there's actually people eating cat here too. They said dogs, cats and rats all. And they don't have lot of facts. Is there any animal you think it's just not OK to eat? I think I can get up. OK. Yeah. So they just eat everything here. Just everything and everything. Kelly somebody is it. Everything on land can be either except the train. Needing a break from the meat market, Ali and I tried some local snake fruit. Oh, I thought there was a net on this. They come in these huge clumps. I've never seen this fruit before. Down the way we had some fried treats down fried. It's a little crunchy and then Joey on the inside. Very simple but very yummy. And finally with no prior planning we ran into mowdy. The accidental St who will be a happy ending to this otherwise difficult to process experience near a customer here. Do you live in Tomahawk? I have a house here. I live in Jakarta. If you want to go to my house. Nina has a house. Please come really, yes. Maybe with time board you have border OK. He just bought the board. Yeah, so she's going to cook it this afternoon so with very little prompting we're headed just a few miles away to Modi's traditional Mina Hassan house. She used to run a porridge restaurant here on the 1st floor. Maybe that's why she once again felt the urge to cook up a warm meal for strangers. Thank you so much for inviting us today. This is so so crazy. We have a wild boar meat here. Beautiful lemongrass, lemon leaves, music to my ears. She just putting garlic in challenge. The smell in here now is crazy. It's so good that sour ginger, turmeric, some chilies, tomato, tons of herbs and seasonings. Now the meat will go left the left. This is the big moment right here putting in the wild boar huge chunks of meat. Is this something that you can make in Jakarta or only here? Only here? Because I didn't get the board meet. I don't get the in Jakarta only here. While the boar is simmering, mowdy shows me how she makes her own special sambal. Starting with Smoked Roja as we remove only the dried fish meat mowdy fills me in on her experience. In tomohon. You only come here a couple times a year. Yes, because my mom here in Ghana do and every time you go to tomohon market everything they have good fish right? Yeah they have like every kind of animal and bird and fish and are there any animals that you don't eat? What is it cuz bread? Oh you don't like that one snake no no no snakes Oh no snake no dog. Before when I say young I eat dog but. Now no and why not anymore because our dog did. Oh no, no yeah, that's why I don't like dog anymore. People will actually capture the dogs right? Steal them and then sell them there. Our dog here. That's so hard, yeah, since then you stop eating dog or before before that. With our fish meat collected it's crushed and the sambal making begins. Starting with ginger and shallots, a ton of ground chilies, tomatoes, some salt and seasonings, and finally the fish powder. This Indo salsa goes perfectly with fried unripe banana chips. Money we have both of these. Once it's up there, it's a relationship. These two go together, right? Yep, tons of fresh chilies in here. Dip it around a little bit. Oh, I show you. I mean, I mean, it's too spicy. It's pretty Dang spicy, but I love it. The banana after you fry it. It's kind of like a potato. It's a little sweet, but very starchy. And then that sauce is just very savory, spicy. Spicy, it is roasting the back of my throat right now, but this is a wonderful combination. Thank you, thank you. With dinner prepared mowdy her daughter Ali and I sit down to a huge N silhouette feast. There's so much food here can I ask you about this? This is music that's the tilapia. These are just super tiny fish mixed with tons of herbs, turmeric, most likely some chilies in there. The Big star for today. I've never had this. This is wild boar with your own secret recipe, just big chunks of boar. Why did you buy 3 kilograms of wild boar? Because I cannot buy just one kilo, so you have to buy like one piece 1 body part like one leg. Yeah, they're like look if you want a leg, you gotta buy the whole leg. Yeah, and this one. These are the tiny little fish on here. Yeah I'm gonna mix that with some rice that looks so nice. I'm so curious about this. Old. That's delicious. Thank you. Very nice texture and full of turmeric, turmeric, chillies. Oh, it's spicy too. You like spicy food? What is more popular here that they don't really use in Jakarta still, and lemongrass is, the taste is from here very strong, but you can tell you like this. Strong lemongrass later. Yeah, well guys, there's no getting around it. I've got some wild boar on my fork. Just a big cube of meat. Beautifully seasoned, simmered in there for about 20-30 minutes and try it out. It tastes like a pork chop, little fatty, very firm, but the seasonings on there are are just unbelievable. So good. What's the difference between a wild boar and a pig? No fat, I think that's why I took little more firm, a little harder and sweet. What makes north celibacy so special? So unique? The food, the food and the paper tomohon is a place of extremes. Whether it's extreme food or extreme hospitality, a place that in the same day took me completely out of my comfort zone, then brought me back with the kind hearted gesture of a stranger. We're going to have the whole crew come in and join in a second. But yeah, thank you so much for this experience. It's unbelievable. Malcolm, I want to take a second to think Ali for joining me today, right? Thank you for this amazing let's get paid today in Indonesia. He also has a company called Escapade Indonesia.

Hiya!!!","Hi all, today I have a message to all the parents out there. Dear parents music can ruin your kid and I say it because for a few years now, nice to music has been in a huge decline. I mean go on YouTube and see for yourself. You always want to be the duck goose man. Maybe I should let them order. Can you believe that this song has no age requirement and was suggested? To me by the YouTube algorithm, without even knowing how old I am. Yes yes, Oh my goodness, this whole pop industry really angers me. It's so cliche. You know 123 they all do the same thing. Boop bop *** pop or even **** pop now I don't want to sound like a preacher. I know that kids are edgy and abuse their freedom on the Internet every day, but at least when they do that, they are aware that this is something they should not be. Doing with music, it's much different because it has no age requirements and it's easily accessible by everyone. Maybe that's why stuff like this is becoming more and more. Normalized we stopped listening to music now instead we watch it. And it's not just women objectification that became mainstream now. Then when you sing, it even drags. Put into a catchy melody. Become mainstream. Kelly Smith I feel just like a Rockstar has been one of the most popular songs of 2017, and I guarantee your kids were listening to this. Pop music is bad for our children. Fat music is not, and here's why I care about this so much. You make me sad. Hi I'm a singer and a music producer myself. I know the power of music and how much it can actually influence your child. That's why I feel relieved to say that not every artist is bad. Quite the opposite. People like John Legend. Coldplay Ed Sheeran Sam Smith Arora are dead and many many more create meaningful music. In two listening to the right songs can shape our children in a good way. So even if there's not much we can do about this bad part of the music industry and what we can do is to make sure that our children know this music is not normal for us. It might be too late, but not for them because it is much easier to build strong children than repair broken women or. Men. 29"

President Putin said the other day that Russia didn't does not engage in state sponsored interference with other countries elections. Do you believe that? Would I do? America Gay Germany are talking about America, Germany. And Russia you talked about President Trump about Mrs. Hillary Clinton about Chancellor Merkel and about President Putin. You've been talking of such big people today. I don't think that somebody you don't need a lawyer like me in between all of you. I never need more lawyer. Yeah. Yes, it's very hard to deal with in Hindi. You cannot trick them because their philosophy is so long. We are simple people. We say what we think."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEOCdo1rfyA,joe bastianich being extra,"been re-watching a lot of MasterChef lately, this is the result. please enjoy how extra Joe is :)","Joe is definitely the scariest judge. He's the judge to win over and if I can do that, then the MasterChef title is definitely mine. I made a pistachio cranberry cherry and gooseberry risotto. What's this? What's this baby powder looking stuff here? That's hazelnut and walnuts mixed with some tapioca maltodextrin. I wanted to give it a little bit of you know what it is. It's garbage is what it is. What you did on that dish is inappropriate. And ultimately, kind of disgusting congratulations. Yeah, and I just burnt my hand when I had the clock and it's fine. Thank you. OK, you set the place on fire. No, it's not funny. It's a little more Hardy. What's wrong, let me see that. That's wrong. I'm going to. I'm going to take this back and I'm going to get you another tray with a cook pork chop because this is unacceptable. OK, alright? So no, no no no. You got a raw, this is wrong. You're going to kill somebody? No, no, no, no no, no, just completely wrong. Fix this, I gotta get another one back hungry. Hi guys rented come here come here stop that's what was serving to the bloody Marines. I'm supposed to eat this really. You know, watching you cook, this was. Just to let that, is this one cooked? If I go back there with another? Dreadful, dreadful. Eggplant is raw bitter, I'ma lammers driving, and she shut down the path. Stop, stop, stop, stop stop. And I love the idea of the toasted slice on the top. It tells me it's going to scream of texture and dark rich flavors. Yeah, I disagree. I think that toast cheapens the dish so you don't serve garlic bread in your restaurant. Now there's no such thing as garlic bread in Italy, so I think it cheapens it. It makes it less than it could be. I disagree if you want to do something interesting, take the sausage, make up 8, spread the patient on the toasted bread. I'm just trying to push you to the next level. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't have to eat it really, you don't. I'm gonna judge here, so why don't you let me figure out what I have to do and what I don't have to do? I know how to do my job. This. Is the problem? With this whole round. It's boring, it's it's. It's not the spirit of what we came here to do, and if you don't want to deliver on the highest level. If you want to play the game, you be safe. You're not going to win this thing. This is master chef. We're trying to find the best amateur chef in America who's here to do that. The challenges are not going to get easier, so get ready to bring it. Bring it 100% and if you're not you should probably just leave your aid from your check yourself out right now because this is getting frustrating. Yeah, but I got here is a mouthful of Peppers. It's not harmonious with the pasta dish like this classics work, and they're appreciated time after time. Otherwise they wouldn't be called classics like you don't look happy. It looks like man, I I. You saw the standard. We put it up there. We asked you to execute it and you come back with this. It's so disappointing. If it's bad, you will go home. Why don't you put nuts in here? I like Mac nuts, macadamia nuts and then Italian tiramisu. I see this. This is. These are all cold garlic cloves in here. Yeah, it's wrong when you go out to eat, I give you a whole cloves of raw garlic to eat. We're here to judge a contest. We're not here to eat raw flour or raw garlic. Several lives in it. Does every exit? There's a sort of yes or no meringue. I mean, you know the headlights be easy questions, ever rising or not. Yes. Disappointed, Mike. Go back to station. The fact that you're not even thinking of playing this game properly is really annoying. I mean, I'm I'm gonna taste this. You want 15 of the same dishes up here? Gotta be kidding me. Plan. This is like a buffet gone bad. Go back to your station. I'm not tasting this crap. Guys have to this point in the competition you need to be listening to what we're telling you about what we're producing because. This is ridiculous. Not only am I advising you. Step up your cooking game. I also advise you to have a little respect. That's the kind of roast that's the kind of restaurant you guys do, which is like, no, I don't want the garlic bread you're such a snob when you give us crap like that to eat, it gets to be almost kind of personally offensive. Understand that. This is a great example of what garbage is like and. Kind of. For producer the name of the show is Master Chef. What do chefs do? Chefs cook. Right, so it's not master orator or master. Tell me about what my intention is about cooking its master chef. You think you're going to impress us with things like suivie emulsify? No. And steaming in the middle. Last but not least, there's a simple issue on the plate and the karlik bread I absolutely love. I'm glad you love it. Love the garlic."

This got more than one football fan worked up. But has the relationship between Mbappé and Neymar really broken down? Do they really hate each other like some people want to believe?

© Oh My Goal - Jellysmack","This bum doesn't pass to me. This is what Kylian Mbappe said about Neymar when he went to sit on the bench after being replaced by Julian Draxler 19 seconds after going off his replacement scored off a pass from Neymar several parts of the French media said that the Frenchman and the Brazilian have become distant, but they might even hate each other now. But isn't this true? Let's go on about this in an orderly manner. Yes, during their first five matches together, Neymar hasn't always delivered assists to Mbappe a rarity. Yes, the Frenchman has seemed annoyed on a number of occasions, but no, they don't hate each other. No, and Bobby doesn't really sincerely believe that Neymar is a bum. These words were spread out of context and exaggerated by certain parts of the media. If you think this photo was taken to reassure the masses and that Mbappe and Neymar smiles aren't sincere. You're suspicious, but you're right, but this hug after PSG Manchester City seems to cut out any doubt right? The two men explained themselves right after the match against Montpelier the day after this comment. The two men were seen laughing together in training. No, there's no hate. What's true is that their relationship, like any relationship, has changed slightly since they both arrived at PSG in the summer of 2017. At the very beginning, and Bombay had the stature of a future superstar. Now he's pretty much erased the word future from in front of superstar. Neymar welcomed him with open arms to the Parisian club, Mbappe and Neymar quickly got along when he arrived in Paris nights out together conversations about the Parisian way of life and many other things. The Brazilian even thinks that he owes a big part of his adaptation to the Frenchman. He taught me a lot about the way to be French. He explained that the French mentality I owe a lot of my adaptation to him, and as a result my happiness here. Now here's what Mbappe recently said about Neymar when I arrived. Ney was a player I admired a lot. He's always been a great player. I grew up with him. He's a player that I saw play and then played with him in Paris. For me. It's an honor Mbappe even talks about a natural feeling with Neymar. Didn't you see Mbappe said he was a player? I admired a lot. It's not just because they played together on a daily basis, it's also because Mbappe has reached the stage of his career where he's now the idol, while Neymar said in May 2021 that he had a brotherly relationship, the Paris number 10 no longer has to act like a Big Brother and Baba is big. Now to the pair don't hate each other, far from it. However, it's also true that a certain amount of distance has grown between them recently inside the club. The pair are a little less close. Lakeith claims Neymar may be struggling to understand about phase desire to leave for Real Madrid this summer after PSG had an amazing transfer window. Plus, the Brazilian clan may not have fully understood the Frenchman's absence from certain events outside of football, which even the newly arrived messy took part in the daily Sport paper also claims Zimbabwe may have had some doubts about his place in the offensive trio. After Messi's arrival, but these reactions from both Neymar and Mbappe are legitimate, it's pointless making mountains out of molehills. This is life in a locker room, while the two men might give the impression that they're a little less close, it's not necessarily because one or the other has started acting differently as just the way things go. Neymar campaigned for Leo Messi to join PSG. Naturally, he facilitated his old friend from Bar, says integration. It's completely legitimate, and that means spending more time with him. Kylian Mbappe was quick to help out. Mashrafe Akimi this comment the annoyance of Mbappe have being ignored by name are these are all just the reactions of competitors. The trio finally got going against Manchester City and their relationship seems to be building Mbappe and Neymar's bond isn't broken. It hit a low point in recent weeks, but they'll bounce back soon. Neymar and Mbappe still have plenty of great stories to write together where the third rider who intends to impress in his brand new publishing house, sticking with tension. How about you watch this video to stay on this theme. I'm sure you'll like it. Do you think something has gone wrong between Neymar and Mbappe? Let us know in the comments. See you soon for another video. Goodbye friends and football forever."

It will now seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The Sri Lankan Government is in discussion with other agencies and countries as well on deferring the loan repayments, the President announced the move as he addressed the country of 22 million people. The decision to deal with the IMF marks a policy shift. Colombo had resisted calls from experts and politicians. To seek the agency's help, but it argued that asking international financial institutions for assistance could bring along conditions which could be detrimental to the country's interests.

Contestant Joe Irvine performed a big band arrangement of “Cry Me a River,” which offended married judges Natalia Kills (best known as Teddy Sinclair) and Willy Moon. Kills accused Irvine of stealing her husband’s look, and Moon compared Irvine to Norman Bates dressing up as his mother. Thankfully, the harsh ad hominem attacks quickly led to the judges being fired from the show. Let’s take a look at all the details of the judges on ""The X Factor"" who killed their careers on live TV.

#XFactor #LiveTV #TVShows

Read Full Article: https://www.nickiswift.com/156122/this-x-factor-judge-killed-her-career-on-live-tv/","American reality show competitions like the Voice and American Idol have long been a great source for viral moments and juicy celebrity gossip, but nothing in the US can top the 2015 moment on the New Zealand version of The X Factor. When one of the judges killed her own career live on the air and took her husband down with her to the judge in question was the singer songwriter, now known as Teddy Sinclair, who at the time went by the stage name Natalia Kills, Kills told W in 2011 that she had a lot of early success in the music industry. Explaining, I put a demo on Myspace in 2008 and Perez Hilton found it and blogged about it. Then suddenly I had two million plays and got to number one on Myspace is unsigned. Artist charts kills moved from her native Britain to Los Angeles and worked with Black Eyed Peas mastermind will. I am on 2 albums and in 2014 she married New Zealand singer Willie Moon who had gained worldwide notoriety in 2012 when his single, yeah yeah was used by Apple in its iPod ads. Everything seemed to be going great for the pair when they were tapped to become. X Factor judges. But that came to a sudden and shocking end on March 15th, 2015, when killed verbally. Confronted contestant Joe Irvine. The problem kills felt that Irvine was intentionally copying her husband style from music to fashion. Ladies and gentlemen. I am just going to state the obvious. We have a doppelganger in our midst. She was just getting warmed up. Though I am disgusted at how much you have copied my husband. From the hair to the suit and she kept piling on. You're a laughingstock. It's cheesy, but it's disgusting. Petra, even when the crowd started booing, she continued to pile on. I found it absolutely, artistically atrocious. I am embarrassed. So what did your husband think? If anything, Moon was even more critical. It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, and I feel like you're gonna stitch someone skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience. And that just prompted kills to go on another rant, it's disgusting. You make me sick. Absolutely disgusting. You have no identity. I can't stand it. I'm ashamed to be here. Fallout with Swift kills and moon were both fired from the show within 24 hours with the show's production company posting a message on Facebook that read in part, we have decided Natalia Kills and Willy Moon are no longer suitable to judge The X Factor New Zealand and have been removed from the show. Louis Walsh, a judge from the British version of the show, slammed kills on the Irish radio station, RTE. 2 FM. She obviously has no class, no taste. She'll never work again, I reckon honestly, I mean, who's going to hire her? Nobody and the show's creator, Simon Cowell, told the Daily Mail that the outburst was quote hateful for her part, kills suggested to billboard that the show's producers may have intentionally coached Irvine to copy her husband in order to get a reaction from her. Obviously, sometimes TV producers plan drama for ratings, and it totally backfires on them. It's awful, he got dragged into this. As for her music career. Kills Co, wrote the song holy water from Madonna's rebel heart album, and she even received a Grammy nomination for Co writing Rihanna Track Kiss it better under the name Natalia Noemi, but when it comes to her solo career as an artist, even years later, her performance on The X Factor continues to over Shadow the music.

https://www.youtube.com/c/buzzfeedtasty","Hi, I'm Carolina, the owner operator of Lady C Cakes based in Los Angeles, CA and I'm going to show you the process of making a wedding cake today. Let's get started when I get the call for a wedding cake. I know it could go in so many different directions. Inspirations usually comes mostly from the story of the couple, what their traditions are and I'm trying. To design the Kate around the wedding cake is going to be the centerpiece of the event. A couple is going to take pictures next to the cake cutting the cake so it has to be perfect. You have to be able to reflect that story in that cake so they can have it in that picture forever. I like to have equal amount of fat cream and cake. So the person that is in in the cake is able to have all the flavors in one bite. So you have to trim the cake and clean it up a little bit. The trick to do it is using a turntable and always keep the knife and the same position. Don't move the knife, just move the turntable and the layers will be all the same. I usually start with the buttercream, mostly. Work with Swiss meringue buttercream, which is a very silky and smooth buttercream and one of the things that my customers love the most is that it's not over sweet. For me. It's very important that the K will be as good inside as it is outside as well. You crumb coated and put it in the refrigerator for a little while. A few minutes will work until you can do the final code. This is one of the most important parts. The cake will reflect whatever mistakes you're making in the final code. It will show through the front then, so it's very important to achieve your sharp edges or whatever shape you're looking for in the gate. Working with fondant is it could be very complicated. Fondant can crack, it can melt and when you start rolling little air bubbles start start popping up and you have to try to manage to take them out because they look horrible in a cake. Of course you've seen a little bit of shortening, helps you to keep them moist and funded the opposite when the fondant is too sticky or wet is not easy to work with. You use cornstarch or powdered sugar. I prefer to use. Cornstarch powdered sugar to me. Kind of dry salad on that a little quicker. It's very trendy right now to have cakes with sharp edges on the top. One of the ways that it works the best for me is flipping the cake over and smooth the fund and once the cake is upside down, which is a little risky and sometimes it can go wrong. All bakers have different techniques to do different things. I guess I'd like to live on the edge all the time and that's kind of like my thing. I use this technique to kind of have that look of concrete. I would say, and it's a pretty simple technique with theme for the result is is very unique and impressive with a simple in football. To make the flowers you can always work in different ways. You can do it by hand or use these amazing tools that we have these days with a different silicone molds which makes it easier and in this case the idea of the look of the cake is to blend. Those flowers are coming out of the concrete. One of the best ways to glow fondant with fondant is just a simple tiny bit of water and that will act as a glue as soon as it dries out fondant. Hates humidity you're living Florida or any other part of the country that rains all the time. It will be very hard for you to work with form then. I still these days with all the experience times that I have to take the fund and out because it didn't work because the fondant draped. I love which is very trendy as well to add little touches of gold using luster task with a little bit of vodka it looks very real. The last details of the cake that I used today I wanted to add a little bit of a modern twist, so I decided to come with this idea, which is a simple technique but it looks so beautiful at the end. I use wafer paper. You have to be a little more careful. It breaks very easily. It's wafer, it's edible and you simple glue the bottom with a little bit of piping gel and then place it on the cake. It's very surprising how people can get so emotional when they see a cake they cry, I understand, but I can't believe it sometimes. Why are they crying? You know, it's the cake. And again, I remind myself it's not just a cake, it's what they were telling me for months. You know that they want to see what they went through this incredible. It's such an honor to be part of a celebration like that with one of my cakes is beautiful."

But with the whole world struggling to contain a pandemic, and unprecedented amounts of funding available, the road to finding the COVID-19 vaccine looks more like this.","Developing a vaccine is a long road full of checkpoints. Different phases of testing are designed to make sure it is both effective and safe, but with the whole world struggling to contain a pandemic and unprecedented amounts of scientific work taking place, the road to finding the COVID-19 vaccine looks more like this. But first, let's take a look at the usual path. During preclinical trials, the vaccine is tested on animals to determine whether they develop antibodies to the disease, causing germs. If these trials are successful, the candidate vaccine moves on to phase one. Trials in humans, during which the vaccine is given to a small number of healthy adults to assess its safety in humans. The results of every phase are reviewed by independent clinical experts who assess the research team's findings. Sometimes they'll pulls the trials to check the results. Always making sure the candidate vaccine is safe. The next phase involves testing a larger group of people to find out the appropriate dose, whether it stimulates an immune response and of course to assess its safety. Once the results have been checked by the independent expert observers, the candidate vaccine is evaluated among thousands more volunteers. This phase determines whether it is effective against disease. If the answer is yes, the vaccine is independently assessed by regulators. For effectiveness, safety, and manufacturing quality, it is also assessed by independent policymakers who determine the best way to use the vaccine. If the assessment meets the regulatory standards, the product can be authorized for use and the vaccine is then ready for licensing and registration. Once that happens, the approved vaccine can be used in the population, but because of the urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine, some of the phases can run in parallel, and the research team can submit a request. For temporary authorization from national regulatory authorities and an emergency use listing from WHO. This authorization in WHO emergency listing are only given if the vaccine meets strict safety and effectiveness criteria, but the road doesn't stop there once the vaccine is in use, it continues to be monitored by health authorities for safety and for effectiveness to ensure the vaccine maintains the highest standards. The race is on to find vaccines for COVID-19, which is why some phases are happening at the same time, but no one is cutting corners. Everyone is subject to the same checks. And independent monitoring. So although we'll get the COVID-19 vaccines faster, they'll be as safe as other approved vaccines."

This increases are occurring despite reductions in testing in some countries, which means the cases we're seeing are just the tip of the iceberg, and we know that when cases increase. So there's continued local outbreaks and searches are to be expected, particularly in areas where measures to prevent transmission have been lifted. However, there are unacceptably high levels of mortality in many countries, especially when vaccination levels are low among susceptible populations, each country is facing a different situation with different challenges. But the pandemic is not over. We call on all countries to remain vigilant, continue to vaccinate, test sequence, provide early care for patients and applying common sense public health measures to protect health workers and the public. We continue to call on everyone to be vaccinated where vaccines are available and we continue to work night and day to expand access to vaccines. Everywhere."

Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IndiaToday","Nations of the hanging are underway as DCP Rao, former DCP Row was also telling us. I remember the the the, you know, the officer police officer who was who played a very crucial role in the investigation. Neil Sharma Anil Kumar Sharma who was in fact at that point of time SHRM wasn't Vihar when this in fact crime took place. There was a former DCP South China Sharma under whom in fact this entire task force. Was made and I I just want to for a moment just give our viewers an update which is coming in from the Tihar Prison. What we are knowing what we've been told right now, is that the all four accused have reached the execution chamber and now their faces are being covered. Remember their hands would be tide, their feet would be tide and then their faces would be covered and the process of execution is just going to begin in a short moment from now. This is the first time in independent. India, the four accused 4 convicts are being hung together. Manish Pandey and anisha matter. Both my colleagues are outside the Bihar prison moonish very quickly. What more details do we have? Double the preparations are on, and at this point of time we have been given to understand is that all prisoners have been marched towards towards the Gallo area. Cotton mask has been put on their face and they were there are six guards per prisoner as of now, so they are being taken to the scaffold area. They have been mounted on the beam where the rope is attached and soon now. The group will be fixed to their neck and then their hands, and you know legs will be tight. I'm also being joined by Anisha. Matharu covered this case from very first step, anisha. Finally they'll be hanging. There were so many legal hurdles as of if we talk about the case. What do you think was the challenging point? When the judiciary you know at that point of time also came under fire and you know it took seven years for the entire, you know judgment to come. See Malaysia. When you're looking at this case, this has been something that the judiciary and the executive expedited very, very much. Because this has been a classic case where a lot of things were expedited, but in the last 1 1/2 years we saw a scene after 2017. Once the appeals were dismissed, none of the from 2017 July 2, 2018 when nervous parents finally went to the Patiala House court asking for a date for the death penalty to be given the executive sat on the entire process. The process. Of ensuring that the death warrants were issued by the judiciary was just not done till it fell on Nirbhaya's parents to run from pillar to post come to the Patiala House Court. If I file a petition and then wait for the replies to be filed for several months, nothing was done and in the last 1 1/2 years we've really seen the delays that can happen when there are. When there is apathy and lapses in the system itself. But on the whole, we've seen this case getting expedited very much. We've seen how the forensics came in very quickly. The DNA reports came in very quickly. The investigation was done. The trial was done expeditiously. The High Court. Considered the appeal, then the Supreme Court considered the appeal within two years. So after all of that, finally we're seeing after 7 1/2 years the death penalty absolutely and Ankit. Now. 4 minutes from now they will be executed so the preparations are at last stage on the beam where the ropes are attached to their neck and you know, moments from now they'll be hanged. You know it's it's. It's very awkward as a human being to in fact. Do a sort of a countdown on somebody's death. Yes, these people you know they are convicted of one of the most heinous crimes, a crime that possibly will be remembered for a very, very long time in Indian history. With that changed a lot of things, but it's very awkward right now to sit here and you know, sort of give you a countdown of four people, those who are going to be executed, 4 people, those who are going to be. Hang in just a short while from now, but this is also a very, you know, stark reminder sober reminder. If you convict a heinous crime, this is how your life ends. Hopefully that it serves as a deterrent as far as the cases against women in the country are concerned. I just want to for a moment, also very quickly give you an update which is coming in from the PR prison at this moment all the four accused are. In fact, in the execution chamber, the process is that they are not allowed to see the the gallows. So before they are taken inside and before their faces is going to be are going to be covered. Pavan is the executioner who is going to cover their faces and then their hands would be tide behind their back. Then their feet are going to be tide and then all four of them in fact would be taken to the hang rope. The the impact, the beam where. The rope is in fact 44 ropes right now are hanging for all these accused. You know, I, I just as I've been saying and I I want to go back to right now to TR for prison where moonish my colleague is munish. A lot of people are there. I mean I would not say that they are there for some sort of a sadistic pleasure, but this is a case which touch chords with at almost every house. I mean, unprecedented amount of protests took place. People took this very personally, it was more or less a turning point where a crime like rape became a discussion point. In every house, just give our viewers a very quick sense of what is happening outside the Tihar prison right now. This is a third execution I'm covering earlier. It was, you know, Kasab and then Jackman. But this is the first time I'm getting a sense where so much crowd has guided I can. I'll request my camera person nasty to show you the visuals outside, you know already there is a corona scare in the country. In this city there are many positive cases. There are many suspects, but more than 1000 people have gathered here. Finally, the jail authorities had to call for the parameter forces and then paramilitary forces have been deployed here. So as of now what we are seeing is that right from the people who stay nearby this area they have. They are holding the placard thanks to judiciary. Thanks to you know the people who were part of it there is, you know tribute to also so lot of people have gathered here at this point of time it is something which is very historic. This. Execution story this decision is historic and that is why we are seeing this unprecedented scene outside the TR jail. There is one minute from now they'll be there is a complete lockdown as munish. In fact is is speaking there from outside. There are a lot of people massive security arrangement, but there is a complete lockdown."

I mean, the truth of the matter is, I don't think he anticipated the movement back off the scene, but there was no way that was gonna hit the stumps. That's his third duck. Have a look at this. Just watch the movement and then the bounce. Well, it stick back and it's just it's obviously very high. The stranger, I think everybody just let it pause, then let it go. Everyone just thought he was going to be too high and say not out, but suddenly the finger came up. There he is. Buckner, no doubt in my mind that that decision should be able to be reversed. Oh, it's a leg break. A big appeal there and I'm afraid, but let's give it the finger. Hussain can't believe it. Under there, that's whether we've got a bit of a raw deal. I think he might have got a bit of bad on that. Well, he's definitely looked at his bat, unhappy with the decision and replay all show us. Well, he was right in front of his stumps, but I think there was bat first. Butler gives it a little nod before the finger goes up. Push the umpire doesn't have the benefit of this replay, but that's going to show us that it almost came off the middle of the bat. That's another very unjust decision to Nasser saying, and I think he knows it. Just have a look at this. The change of the expression on the face total disbelief. Big shout not interested, Steve Bucknor. Once you see that head was in shock immediately you know it's when he stands there and looks that you start worrying as a batsman. Yeah, so it's. It's always a good shout with Monty. That one didn't spin enough, in fact was just straight. Well, that's a very good delivery. Big Shout might have just been going. Lakeside Shane Warne can't believe Steve Bucknor has said not out but the man who matters is the umpire and Steve Bucknor thought the ball was going down. Piston line, no doubt about it. Straightening up Danish kaneria. They've gone for the appeal. Steve Bucknor is not convinced. Well, he is. Finally, he makes that decision. It was a very late call from him. Prince didn't like it at all once again, undone by a wrong one. We were seeing it early on. Maybe the bad just hitting the turf and nothing else. Maybe there was an edge, but there were certainly some confusion confusion in his mind as well. He took a lot of time to raise that finger. Prince didn't like it. But Pakistan have got a crucial breakthrough very early in the day. Six down now South Africa 1:30. A big appeal again, and he's giving him. In his turn and hit the back leg and probably feel himself a little bit unlucky. Not too happy myself with this board pitched way out in a rough and spawned a long way back. We're heading towards the storms, but I'm not too sure it would. It would have reached the old storm, but the 7416. I don't. It's a bump. All I would think. There's a given it. Well, yes he has. There's a funny sort of appeal 'cause I think the umpire was waiting for the batsman to war. Also, Mark Taylor may have hit the ground at the same time as the edge. The ball, and sometimes when you do that as a batsman you don't know that you've actually nicked it. We know that Taylor hit the ground. You can see the dust come up as he plays the stroke. We assume that it's gone off the edge as well. It's pitched in the footmarks there. Oh, it's just the turn so Taylor hasn't hit it. It was just the spin out of the footmarks that's taking up the first. Has he gone this time? They've all gone up steep, but is unmoved not for the first time. The umpires. Now the focal point. And in fact, I think Andrew Symonds looked back as soon as he paid it, which is normally a give way. Yes. Oh clear, clear outside Edge but Steve Bucknor. Afraid said no. Look at that. It's such a big nick. No, wasn't it outside edge? Was it? Yes, it was wrong. He probably not happy with it. Not happy whatsoever. It may have brushed the pad, we just have a look whether the bat was anywhere in the way. Oh yes, the battle is nowhere near it's gone off the pads. Everything seemed to be tucked behind that front pad and so the only noise given was the ball flicking the pad. Maybe on the way through, but certainly not glove, not bad. It's another shocker. Hang on a minute slaps you might have been given out LBW. Still a shock or if that's the case. Want to show you the round Robin dismissal? I want you to look at two people here, Adam Gilchrist and Steve Bucknor. Watch for Adam Gilchrist. There you go, right? Mr Gilchrist. What did you hear? You, Mr. Buckner, what did you see? Power. Boom he's taking the bills off, obviously seeing something. He's saying. Now that. Correct? It could be the reason why he's appealed, and again, there's a shadow, and that's the reason why when there's a third empire in play. He's out here, but Buckner has not asked for the third umpire. His foot is on the line. It's not grounded when it the bales come off. Tony has seen it. He's seen it from 4 feet. Controversial decision, have a look at this. This will give you a clearer idea. The bales are out. Bales are gone as footers in the air. He asked the square leg empire. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that he's past his sell by date. This is out. He should have gone upstairs. He's got the experience is shelf. Is over. It's time to retire on. The ICC have to look at it seriously. Cannot go on past reputation now, both sides stand and applaud and let one man lead him off. Steve Bucknor has had a long and distinguished career as an umpire. It's his last game. And rightly so here on his home soil of the West Indies. He's at Jamaican where he's leading the sides off. Well done. Steve bucknor. Career Test match. Umpiring career which started in 1989. He stood in the 181 One day internationals. His final one today of course 128 test matches. You can safely say he can be very proud. Of what he's done."

CBS reporter Weijia Jiang asked Trump why he waited so long ‘to warn people the virus was spreading like wildfire’ in February ‘instead of holding rallies with thousands of people’? An irritated Trump touted his China travel ban as proof he acted fast. Jiang persisted with her point and said: ‘When you issued the ban, the virus was already here,’ to which Trump said: ‘Do your research.’

In a highly combative debut speech to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, the US president mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his ""depraved regime"".  

Al Jazeera's Diplomatic Editor James Bays reports from the UN headquarters in New York.

The message is really a message of peace. It's a message of coming together. But once he headed to the General Assembly Chamber, His Excellency Donald Trump, he had a very different message delivering a speech that astonished many diplomats by including an unprecedented threat to annihilate. Another UN member states the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The words were just the sort of language that earlier the UN Secretary general had warned against. Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings. The solution must be political, and this is a time for statesmanship. We must not sleepwalk our way into war. President Trump's foreign policy challenges are growing. His critics say it's only of his own making. He doesn't now just face possible confrontation with one nuclear power North Korea, but with a second one, Iran, two as he continues to suggest, he's likely to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal. The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one sided transactions the United States has ever. Entered into frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States and I don't think you've heard the last of it. Believe me, that received strong support from Israel's Prime Minister, but only tepid applause from those in the General Assembly. So I've listened to. Countless speeches in this hall. But I can say this. None were bolder. None were more courageous and forthright. Than the one delivered by President Trump today. The UN is normally a place of nuance and compromise, but President Trump sees things in starkly black and white terms. Even some of the countries that are normally friendly to the US are alarmed. One Western foreign minister told me that President Trump comments on North Korea what unhelpful, and a senior Security Council diplomat said to me. Why does he want to provoke 2 simultaneous nuclear crises? James Bay, Al Jazeera at the United Nations."

http://www.facebook.com/epified","The history of the pundits of Kashmir goes back to the period when the audience Saraswat Brahmins who used to live on the banks of the Saraswati River migrated to the Kashmir Valley. With the passage of time, they assumed the name but does. And now they are popularly known as the Kashmiri Pandits. The Kashmiri Pandits who formed a significant part of Kashmir were closely associated with its culture, customs and traditions. The land of Kashmir was home to many. The first struggle for survival faced by the Kashmiri Pandits was during the reign of Abhimanyu. It was during the 14th century that Kashmir came to contact with the Muslim invaders who took advantage of the weak administration of the Laura Dynasty and established their rule. It is said that during 1089 to 1100 and 180 Muslim generals who were employed by the then king began consolidating their roots as a community in Kashmir. The first direct assault to Kashmiri Pandits during 1252 to 1273. Eighty took place when they conspired against the king and failed in their attempts to overthrow him. The King took action against them and they faced much torture. During 13101 to 1320 eighteen the rulers encouraged the influx of Muslims into the valley to counter the supremacy of the Brahmans. Most of the rulers who came later tried to do away with them. Some of them adopted methods similar to the infamous genocide of the Jews in Germany during Hitler's rule. These rulers try to exterminate and eradicate all Hindus from Kashmir. Alicia, who ruled Kashmir during 1413 to 1438, adopted tyranny as his tool of administration. His reign was carried out with killings, conversions and false taxation on the budgets. He forbids ceremonies and enforced conversions on the pundits fearing conversion. Many kill themselves. Many pundits fled from their homes and found refuge in other places. This oppression of the pundits was one of the most terrible instances of mass exodus. Throughout this. New respondents were banned from attending religious prayers and meetings in temples. However, when Sultan Zainul Abidin took over the rule of Kashmir, he chose the toilet and bath. He ensured that the pundits glory was resurrected and they were given back all that they had lost. This was the phase of peace for the pundits who lived in their homeland without any threat. In the following years, the Kashmiri Pandit suffered terribly under the rule of Shamsuddin Iraqi and Musa Reina. The pundits were stripped off their religious identity and their religious scriptures were burned. Those who opposed were slaughtered mercilessly when Akbar the Mughal came to power. He ruled with tolerance towards the Kashmiri Brahmins as well. His policies towards religious practices were lenient and all throughout his role, pundits were respected and given the freedom to perform their religious festivals and live secure lives. The period between 1753 to 1819 was again a period of cruelty and anarchy. Afghan rule of this. Victimized the pundits in the worst form. This was a period of genocide when thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were killed. History provides instances of parents shaving off their daughters heads and cutting their nose so as to destroy their beauty and save them from disgrace. Sikh rule in Kashmir was a period of relief for the pundits after years of torture and barbarism. By this time, a majority of the population had already converted to Islam and most had left the state. Those who remained claimed back their lost honor by rebuilding their homes and temples in hopes of starting afresh. In 1846, during the Dogra rule, the pundits were again targeted when their political, religious and cultural freedom were curtailed. The communal disturbances of 1931 pushed many pandits towards migration. Their houses were looted, shops burned. Women and children abducted, and the whole community tortured. In order to establish the dominance of 1 community in the region of Kashmir, the inhuman acts against the pundits which had been prevailing since ancient times. Don't brutal and barbaric in what we can call the genocide of pundits. The Kashmiri Pandits with a history of over 5000 years in Kashmir will meet victims once again in one of the ugliest chapters of Indian history. In the year 1990, following threats against all Hindus to leave Kashmir, there was a widespread chaos in the area when the pundits were targeted and killed, people were shot in the open and the anti India slogans were released. Temples and houses were burned down and there were explosions in various parts. Thousands were reported dead. Those who survived the massacre fled to other parts of the country. The extermination of the bandits 25 years ago is perhaps the most tragic incident of the recent past, and one that needs to be talked about more often. At present there are hardly any pundits living in Srinagar or any other part of the valley. Some of them live in refugee camps in Jammu, while a few live in Delhi and Mumbai. The Jewish community has lived in India without any instances of anti-Semitism or hatred. Since then, India has provided them with all resources for growth and development. See to the Princess of Metella when she was young. Once playfully picked up the ball of Shiva since it was a weapon only the gods could wield. Her father, Jenica was very surprised."

I wonder why they picked him. He had his reputation as a bit of an upstart as sort of a young rising figure in the party, but no one knew who this guy was. This was his chance to introduce himself to people. Tonight is a particular honor for me because let's face. My presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student. Born and raised in a small village in Kenya. What makes a great political field is if you can somehow fold your story into this larger American story. The next thing he says is about his mother's family. His grandfather fought in World War Two. He used the GI bill. They settled in Kansas, so white people could say, oh, he's just like us. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story that. I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible. Going into this speech, we've had four years of George Bush and we felt as a country like we've grown further apart, 04 was very much a divisive partisan race. Obama speech is in some ways an antidote to that, alongside our famous individualism. There's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we're all connected as one piece. If there is a child on the Southside of Chicago who can't read that matters to me, even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs, and having to choose between medicine and the rent. That makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent. It is that fundamental belief. I am my brothers keeper. I am my sisters keeper that makes this country work. E Pluribus Unum, out of many one. And he gives a speech that presages his entire political message in 2008, which is this sort of post partisan argument. Now, even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us. The spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embraced the politics of anything goes. Well I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. Obama was born with two great gifts. That one is his mind and the other is his ability to speak to large groups of people. There are free things that Obama does that really makes that speech effective. He wants concrete detail. He likes story and he loves antithesis. The use of repetition and structure to show contrast. There is not a liberal America or a conservative America. There is one America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latinoamerica and Asian America. There's the United States of America. The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red States and blue states. But I've got news for them too. We worship an awesome God in the blue States and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the Blue States and yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the Stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. But the way uses his hands, he actually points a lot and does a lot of this. A lot of this. A lot of that. In doing so, he gives off this sense of energy. I am new, I'm someone who is dynamic and he doesn't do that much anymore. He's a little more solemn and reserved when he gives speeches today, but I think it's more reflective of his office. In the end, in the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope? It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs, the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval Lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta, the hope of a mill worker son who dares to defy the odds. The hope of a skinny kid with a funny name, who believes that America has a place for him too. Both. Hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope. His appearance at that convention, which was the best speech of the Convention better than John Kerry, was electrifying, and without it, he wouldn't be president. I think sincerity means a lot. There are people who, when they speak, they speak the truth as they see it, and they're they're very effective doing that. I believe this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness, a brighter day will come. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jcvVWc25-U,The Real Reason Joe Bastianich Left MasterChef,"If you have been a fan of Fox’s MasterChef since its inception, you will be familiar with Joe Bastianich. He was a judge on the popular reality cooking show for its first five seasons and helped make the show a success.

However, we all know now that the celebrity chef is no longer part of the show. Besides being a television personality, Bastianich is also a renowned restauranteur who owns restaurants in four countries.

Being a global restauranteur doesn’t give you much time for TV, but is that the reason why Joe Bastianich left MasterChef? A 2014 Facebook post gives the answer to that question.

#MasterChef #Chef #CookingShow

Read Full Article: https://www.mashed.com/353355/the-real-reason-joe-bastianich-left-masterchef/","Fans will remember chef and entrepreneur Joe Bastianich from his time on Master Chef as well as his stint on Master Chef. Junior Bastianich was a judge on the cooking competition from its debut in 2010, staying for five seasons before he parted ways. With the series in a 2014 Facebook post, Bastianich gave fans a bit of an explanation for his decision, revealing as co-owner and partner of the Battalion, Bastianich Hospitality Group as well as evenly throughout the Americas. I will be focusing my time and energies on their continued global expansion. This is not going to apply. This is disgusting. This is not how you work in restaurants. It seemed that despite his often prickly personality on camera, his decision wasn't motivated by any bad blood or issues with the show itself. He even commented to E News. I had a great experience. It was a show that changed my life. Still many guests. There was a deeper reason for his departure. Family has been a crucial factor in the chef's life and career ever since he was just a boy. His family ran a restaurant in Queens and the future Master Chef judge grew up watching his parents drive to achieve their culinary dreams. As he told Reuters, my sister Tonya and I were practically raised in restaurants. Or my mom came from New York and from Italy. They asked me what is the standard of pasta and I said there's only one standard. It's my mother mom. Lidia Bastianich went on to achieve success far beyond their brick and mortar restaurant location, creating a culinary empire that included a popular PBS cooking show, cookbooks and much more. Family and food have clearly been entwined in Joe's life since his childhood, and it seems his own wife and children may have played into his decision to leave MasterChef. He told the TV page in 2015 that with the Sun beginning high School and his daughter attending college, he wanted to be able to spend more quality time with them. There can only be one master chef, but even after his departure from the US version of the show, Bastianich wasn't quite willing to leave his place behind the judging booth. He became a judge on MasterChef Italia, and his time there only served to increase his recognition across Italy, although it wasn't all positive. Grubstreet reported that a 2018 episode of the show featured Bastianich making some off color comments while visiting an Italian nail salon, Bastianich quickly apologized, explaining to the outlet that the segment was scripted, but adding. I'm sorry, I said those things. He also opted to diversify his role. Using his knowledge of the restaurant industry to become one of the stars of restaurant startup, a reality series, or Bastianich joined Chef and restaurateur Tim Love. That show also involved competition, but rather than home cooks vying for top prize teams competed for the attention of Bastien at your love as investors in their flailing restaurants. That show didn't quite have the same enduring popularity as the Master Chef franchise, and was only on the air for three seasons. I am right now, kind of freaking out, but this chef TV pursuits weren't limited to the culinary world. Bastianich was also a presenter. On the one and only season of top Gary Talia still it appeared there was trouble brewing back in the kitchen. The chef's company Battalion, Bastianich Hospitality Group came under fire after his departure, either reported that there was a toxic quote. Boys Club culture alleged by dozens of employees at several of the company's restaurants. Though his partner, Mario Batali was at the center of many of the allegations. Bastianich, along with his partner and mother Lydia, as well as chef Nancy Silverton, announced that major changes would be made at the company as a result of the controversy. With so much drama happening in his off camera projects. Bastianich simply long for a return to something familiar by 2017, he was back as a master Chef, Junior judge. Reuniting with fellow chef and host Gordon Ramsay, Joe brings to master Chef what he has done in the previous Four Seasons. Complete utter misery, getting the crack or smile from him is like trying to get into Pentagon. While the initial trio involved Ramsey Bastianich and chef Graham Elliot in the years since, Bastianich left, there were a few shakeups to the master. Chef USA judging lineup. Now the judging trio consists of Bastianich Arone Sanchez. And Ramsay all bringing their unique perspectives and culinary backgrounds to the show. Bastianich also continues to grow as culinary empire and with his partners is at the helm of numerous restaurants around the world.

Here we go. Well, if you don't mind Mr. President that this caravan was an invasion. As you know, I consider it to be as President. Caravan was not an invasion, it's a it's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the US. Thank you. And why did you? Why did you characterize it as such? As I considered an invasion, you and I have a difference of opinion. Do you think that you demonized immigrants, that his election to try to get them? I want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally. You know, they have to come in Jim through a process. I want it to be a process and I want people to come in.

We need the people, but your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on it for it. But they weren't act are not going to be doing. They weren't actors. Well no, it's true. Do you think they were actors? They weren't actors. They didn't come from Hollywood. These were these were people. This was an actual. You know it happened a few days ago and there are hundreds of miles away, though there are hundreds and hundreds of miles away that that's not an invasion. Honestly, I think you should let me run the country you run CNN, and if you did it well, your ratings, let me ask you if I may ask the question Mr. President, if I may ask the question. Are you worried that's enough? That's enough? That's enough? That's one of the other folks. That's enough. Pardon me, ma'am. Enough, this President had one of the options. If I may ask on on the Russia investigation, are you concerned that that you may have? I'm not concerned about anything with you main investigation, because it's a hoax. That's enough. Put down the mic, Mr. President, are you worried about indictments coming down in this investigation? Mr. President, I tell you what CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn't be working for CNN. Go ahead. I, I think that's a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible and the way you treat other people are horrible. Mr. President, you repeatedly over the course just sit down, please. Well, when you when you report fake news, no. When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people. Go ahead, miss."

How do you expect the Indian skipper to fare when the teams meet later this year?","Any answers man for the big stage? The big occasion, the bigger the game, the more he wants to contribute. He likes a fight. He likes a scrap as well and he loves playing against Australia. Beautiful hands, beautiful wrists, beautiful batsman. We want him to back till the end. At the times as well enough. Glenn Maxwell can't believe it, and the reason why he can't believe it was he was beating him flight and that's his proves how good Barack Kohli is. Wasn't even close to the length swing through off balance. Just carries offense. Carla look at his face. He's determination. I knew that I was hitting the ball well, but you know, come to 18th or when we decided to take it on. I I sense that you know, now or never. I mean this is. This is the time that I I have to go and I was able to execute the right kind of shots at the right time. We can play all the shots, look at that one. This blurk is brilliant and this is when it comes to life. And listen to the crowd they chanting koelling koelling advances. He goes in the air. There is long off he can only watch it go over his head for four six. I love it. I love it beautiful without you gotta carry on digging behind the semis.

Now the Congress LED opposition had called the Bills anti farmer. The two farm bills were passed in Rajya Sabha amid raucous and protests by the opposition. The farm bills were passed by voice vote in the upper house making it last in the Indian constitution. Although the opposition which lacked enough numbers to block it, has demanded that the bill needs to be sent to a Select Committee for review. The opposition created huge ruckus and rushed to the well of the house, protesting against the bills. Voice vote took place when the house resumed after a 10 minute adjournment amid the uproar by the opposition earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended the three legislations passed in the parliament to modernize the Indian agrarian sector. Prime Minister Modi said that the bills have been passed to empower the farmers so that they can sell their produce in any part of the country. The BJP was attacked by opposition for attempting to dismantle the old structure of procurement through legislations. Now the BJP in India is not the first party to move ahead with the new procurement system. Congress, a leading opposition party, had promised dismantling of the current system in its manifesto. During the Lok Sabha election in 2019, the current bill is intended to do away with the middle men. India agrarian sector remains unreformed because of intense politicization of the farming community with the abolition of the APMC Act, farmers in India will be able to self produce in any part of the country the bill. Also incentivizes participation of the private sector. The idea is to cut the middleman between seller and the buyer. Many states in India do not have the APMC Act, but still have done very well in protecting the interests of the farmers Prime Minister also said that minimum support price will not be done away with and people should not give in to fake news.

Bella Poarch's Signature TikTok Makeup Routine | Beauty Secrets | Vogue","Hey guys it's Bella Poarch today. I'll be showing you guys how I do my skin care routine and how I do my classic boa look. My first step is cleanser. My next step is to put vitamin C on my face. I feel like vitamin C is so important. And then I use the touch a moisturizer. This is my favorite. It doesn't really leave my skin oily. SPF sunscreen is so important too. And throughout the day, keep applying. Growing up in the Philippines, my mom didn't really give me any skin care tips. I have like ants and like aunties that would tell me like, oh, you'd like some screen. Now that I'm done with my skin carotene. My first step for my makeup is foundation. I use this by Murphy. I just take like a like 1 pump. It's been like a crazy year for me. I I downloaded. Tick tock. Last year, around January for fun, because my friends were like recommending it. I grew up with and watching anime. The girls in the anime they have like really like rosy cheeks and that's how I got inspired to do like my. Rosy pink cheeks on tick tock. Whenever I wear out in public, people would ask me is your face where or did you get like sunburn? And I'm like no it's makeup but I think it's really cute. When I did the entered the Bay Video flash here and it was like that IK my tick tock that went viral. I woke up the next day and I had like a million legs. I was still in shock 'cause I was like Oh my gosh that's that's a lot of likes. My next step is concealer. I use Nars concealer. Just put it under like. Under my eyes, just a little bit just like that. My next step is my eyebrows is I use benefit? The difference between like Philippine may grow up and be less makeup is that Philippines? They don't really like foundation or like really thick makeup and I noticed they like to put like the middle part of your lips like make it like reddish pink. That's basically like the the look growing up. I didn't really. I wasn't allowed to wear makeup in school so like all my friends have like lipstick on and they have like eyeliner and. I wasn't allowed to. So I was always jealous. OK, so the next step is I use this browser by Charlotte Tilbury. I really like it. Been using it for a while now. First I start off with like. My cheeks. I like to like. Contour my nose. I just use like my finger. It matches my skin pretty well. That's all it was when I do for the contour and the broader next, I'm going to do my lips and I get this phone Charlotte Tilbury and it's pillowtalk. It's like one of my favorite lip liners. So if you could see my upper lip is like darker than my bottom lip, my Filipino friends have like the same and they always hated it. They're like. How do I get like just pink upper lip? 'cause it's like a Filipino thing. I guess. I feel like you just gotta embrace like where you're from. And I came to the United States when I was like 14 and I got bullied a lot. And yeah, so many bad experiences I went through. In high school, just because of what I look like, I feel like it still happens a lot and it needs to be like talked about more because. It's not OK to like bully people because of where they came from or what they look like. Even if after I graduated high school I still had like my high school bullies just bullying me on my Instagram post. I feel proud of myself for. Just believing it myself and getting this far in my life. My next step is lipstick and this is my favorite from Gucci. I couldn't afford this, probably like. A year ago, I'm just so grateful now that I can afford this face like things and. I'm very grateful I want to make everyone. Specialist Philippines like that's my home. Now we have. Blush a lot of people ask me what I use and how I do my. My classic MTV below sunburn. Look that Rick tool it is you put it not so close to like you're under like under your eyes and make it look like you just got sober. A lot of people use makeup brushes for like their entire face. I feel like sometimes it's good to use like your your fingers 'cause. You can control how much you put in it and then you can make it look. Natural to make it look so much better. Don't forget to like put concealer just so it can lighten up in this part. Just put a little bit on top of like your nose bridge and then exaggerate. More put more in these areas. Next step highlighter you notice like in my empathy video my face is kind of like Chloe and like very shiny is because of the highlighter. First I put it on my finger and then I put it on. It took awhile. And then you put it on your chin to make it look shiny cute. For a little bit on the cheap. Now you guys know how to do it. I use this for like my eye makeup and everything. This is literally the only brush, and so I just. Put some like right here. So now last thing I'm gonna brush out my eyelash extensions. So this is what I use for my hair and you can like control the temperature and I don't want to go too hot 'cause I have like really thin hair. In the military. I have to do my hair every morning and I have to put it in a bun and I can do it in like 2 minutes. If it doesn't look perfect then. My my petty officers would just tell me. Bring to you here I want to do the military also taught me how to be like a professional. Everything has to be perfect. And after I strain my hair, I just like grab the two strands. This is the. Look thank you guys so much for watching."

ABOUT VOGUE
Vogue is the authority on fashion news, culture trends, beauty coverage, videos, celebrity style, and fashion week updates. 

Every Outfit Hailey Bieber Wears in a Week | 7 Days, 7 Looks | Vogue","Hi Vogue, it's Hayley Bieber today. I'm going to be showing you guys what I wear in a week. OK, so this is my cozy, comfy athleisure look. This is definitely something I would love to fly in or maybe for even a long road trip to start. I wouldn't be in hotel slippers so I'm going to take these Nike SB's hold those up like that. 'cause I just think it looks cooler and then. I'm going to put it with this cool like charcoal Gray coat that is from la Mer. I love a really long sleeve on a coat. It's everything to me. I love this sweatshirt because it's like a little bit worn and it's vintage. But it is that yummy fleece on the inside. So this look for me is more of a like a New York style look when it starts to get chilly there bye love these marshmallow pants. I've had them for a long time. I love the way that they fit. This is a very cozy cashmere Bottega Veneta sweater so I feel like I'm going to be able to have this sweater for 20 years and it's never going to go out of style and my kids can steal it from me. One day I used to steal a lot of sweaters from my mom when I was younger. She had like this amazing cashmere sweater collection. I'm going to do this really cool Red Saint Laurent coat. Me trying to get things off the rack without knocking million things over so I am obsessed with this coat. It's going to be my coat of the season I'm going to go with these Alexander Wang Heeled booties. Please excuse me while I try to get these on, but you wanted to see how I really get myself dressed, so this would be what it's like 1. It didn't rip, it. Did it rip? It's just the sound of the pants. That's the one thing about this material is. It's a little bit loud, especially if you like sit down in them or sit on like a leather seat and you're just like it's just the pants. I swear and I'm going to pair it with. This YSL bag I love this necklace in general. I'm just not sure if I want it with this outfit. I think I like it with this for sure. When I was buying this coat and I decided to go up two sizes just to first of all feel cozy. But second of all, when you're trying to put sweaters and more bulkier things underneath them just so you have more room to do that, so bad coat necklace. Good to go. So this is my kind of day to night look and these pants are my like favorite thing of the season. Right now they're by the brand Kate, which I really, really love. I just love the way that they fit. I love the length of them. I love the little split at the side so you can wear them with a flat shoe and they're flattering. Or you could wear them with a heel and they're super flattering. This little bralette. I also really love. It's by Jack moose. Simon, don't kill me. Mispronounced it. I wear a lot of Blazers. I think Blazers are an essential part of anybody's wardrobe. At least a really good staple black woman or Gray one or neutral colored one from Magda Bertram. This one you can see kind of comes in at the waist. Cinches here is a little bit more flattering. I'm going to pair it with these white Tom Ford heels. I love that they're a little pop of white. I think it's super cute. I think I would go with. Probably this white jock moose so it's like pop of white and pop of white together. Throw it over my shoulder. I feel very like business chic in this outfit. Feels very like mature but cool. I love it and call it a day tonight. So this is my date night look and I went with a cute little black dress that's usually my favorite. Go to for any type of going out or date night situation. I love heels that have straps like that that go around the ankle. I think it's really sexy. Let's say it was maybe chilly in the evening. I would pair this with this Marina Moscone one. It actually hits a very similar length to the dress. And I think it brings a cool little edge to the outfit. And since it's an all black outfit, I like a little pop of color with it. I think it's always fun to get dressed up for date night and even just get dressed up for each other and nobody else. I wouldn't say husband is too overly picky about anything I wear. I think he just feels like if I feel good in it then he likes it too. So this is a wack wolford bodysuit and a pair of blue jeans. I'm gonna start with this Zara belt. But you never seen someone struggle so hard to put on a belt. Check it. Yep belts, I'm going to put this coat with it and this coat is from a brand called Ray. I hope I'm saying that right and please don't be mad at me if I'm not. I'm not sure 100% about the shoes I'm going to try. Probably two different things I'm going to do 1 boot on one side and these boots are, I think like a must staple in anybody's closet, and they're from the row and then I'm probably going to just put a sneaker on the other foot and see what I like better. I think I'm feeling the boots. So I'm going to go look at boots. I'm going to do this YSL bag with it because I love this bag. I use this bag a ton. I feel like it's a great everyday grab and go take the bag. I think it's really cute. I think it's simple. I think it's practical. I like it. So this is my casual Saturday look and I am wearing these really cool baggy Natasha Zinko jeans that I love. They're a little bit more tomboy. I've been photographed in these jeans quite a few times. They're my favorite fit. I love these ones. I don't care to repeat them. This sweater is from mango. It's so easy to just throw on. It's a great color. I would definitely do sneakers, so I'm going to do these white. Air Force ones. I weirdly sneakers like literally everything. I think the way you can keep something really casual really chic is the way that you accessorize it or dress it up. Because it's such a casual outfit, I like to elevate it with a cool bag. I particularly like this adorable little baby Prada bag and I like the color. I know people always see me wearing a bun. I know people are tired of it, but sometimes I'm just lazy and I don't feel like doing my hair so that throwing a little baseball hat. This one says I am a voter which I am and you should be too. Hopefully you're registered. Hopefully you're going to get out there and vote. It's so important. Please do it. So this is my Sunday look and this is a look that I would do at home if we were having people over hosting Sunday dinner recently decided we're going to do a once a month pizza night at our house. I don't have shoes on right now because if I was going to wear this at home, I'd probably just be barefoot. We have a no shoes rule in our house which I've never been too picky about. Shoes in the house, but my husband does not like it. I like that it almost looks like pajamas, but it's a little bit more elevated. I love matching set. This one is by Nushka which is another brand that I really, really love. You know I have my days where I like to be a bit more girly. A bit more grown up and then I have my days where I like to be a bit more tomboy and I feel like this is like the opposite end of the spectrum of tomboy for me. Thank you vogue. That was what I wear in a week. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I hope maybe you were able to pick up some tips or inspired to try something a little bit different with your style. I'll see you next time."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpBD7QGR_xU,Plan B put to vote in UK as Omicron spreads and booster rush continues - BBC News,"More than half a million people booked their Covid booster jabs on Monday - despite the NHS website crashing as thousands sought top-up doses.

Boris Johnson revealed the figure a day after pledging that boosters would be offered to all over-18s by 31 December.

Long queues formed at walk-in vaccination sites on Monday, with some people waiting five hours to get jabs.

The PM and the NHS are now appealing for volunteers to help get jabs into arms and run vaccination centres.

It comes as Boris Johnson is set to face his biggest backbench rebellion since the 2019 general election as MPs will vote on new Covid rules for England later.

#BBCNews #Covid #Omicron","It is says the government, a race between the virus and the vaccine, and people have been rushing to receive their booster jab after ministers warned of a tidal wave of infection caused by the Omicron variant of COVID. That has meant delays for some people trying to access appointments and a fresh government call for vaccine volunteers. No variant of COVID-19 has spread this fast in the Commons yesterday, the Health secretary Sajid Javid said Omicron now represented 20% of cases in England. And was accelerating fast. The booster program has been expanded with anyone over 18 able to book a jab from Wednesday. That means NHS resources are being switched to focus on delivering vaccines and urgent clinical care. The health service in England has been put on its highest level of emergency readiness level 4 national incident, meaning it can be coordinated at a national level. A letter from NHS bosses says even with the protection of booster jabs, the threat from Omicron remains serious and the number of people requiring care could be significant. While vaccines are the first line of defense, the governments of all UK nations agree further measures are needed to try and slow the spread of Omicron. In the Commons today there will be a series of votes beefing up public health protections in England. There will be one on more mandatory mask wearing another on replacing self isolation with daily testing for people exposed to a positive case of the Omicron variant, but it's the plan to require a negative COVID test or proof of vaccination status to attend crowded events that has riled many Tory MP's. Actively, actually are and evidence from other countries suggests that they're not very effective, but also have a problem with the government requiring people to do that. Up to 70 conservatives may rebel against the government, arguing that these restrictions go too far. These votes will be judged as a test of Boris Johnson's authority over his party to a beleaguered Prime Minister who may well need Labour MP's to get his policy through Ben Wright, BBC News, Westminster."

How I'm how I'm going to die? My colleagues and I rushed to the ER to find that there was actually nothing left. It took only seconds to cause so much death and damage that Lebanese people are calling it their 911. We're gonna take you from the epicenter of this horrific blast. And hear from the people in its path. As it ripped through the center of a city once known as the Paris of the Middle East. Killing and injuring. I don't know. And leaving more than a quarter of a million people without habitable homes. Beirut is the capital of Lebanon and home to 2 million people. It's an ancient city scarred by war but vibrant, welcoming a full of life over the decades it suffered so much, but no single event. As bad as this. This is the epicenter a warehouse in Beirut's port where the disaster began with a fire. Inside, unbeknownst to most of Beirut, were nearly 3000 tons of the fertilizer ammonium nitrate. And they weren't being safely stored when that exploded. It looked like a mushroom cloud. He felt like an earthquake. As far away as Cypress. As the shock waves radiated out, boats were blown out of the water. Grain stores on which this country lies were destroyed. And the firefighters, who'd rushed in when the fire first broke out, really didn't stand a chance. Safras was one of them, and one of the first of the dead to be named. She was a volunteer firefighter, just 25 years old and about to get married. Footage posted on social media shows her distraught fiance behind the coffin trying to lay his hand on it to get as close to her as he can. St. Georges Hospital is close to the waterfront. In the labor ward, a young woman called Immanuel was about to give birth to bring new life into the world. Her husband Edmund was filming when it happened. Lladro ceiling was down. I was afraid that. She might be hit or the baby was hit. She was all covered with glass. I tried getting my wife out first. I moved the bed outside and then I started helping the nurses and doctors to get them get them up. Amazingly, both the baby George and his mother are fine. All around the city. Moments of life. Moments of celebration were shattered. Israel, who's a doctor, had come back to Lebanon from the states to get married. She too was posing for her wedding photos when she was knocked off her feet by the force of the blast. I I was shocked I was. I was wondering what happened. Am I going to die? How I'm how I'm going to die? I've been preparing for my big day. Like for two weeks. I was so happy like all the other girls are I'm getting married. Where is gonna be happy seeing me in a white dress? I'm gonna, I'm I'm I'll be looking like a Princess on everything I'm not sure she. Animal salt lamp. I say no. Muffy, Muffy she is not. Limited. This is what's left of a neighborhood known for its nightlife. Many of the buildings here have balconies that overlook the port of Beirut, so people would have been standing on their balconies or near their windows, stretching their necks to catch a glimpse of the fire when the blast struck. If you were here when this happened where you were standing would have made the difference between life and death between a superficial or a very serious injury. Another BBC reporter was in the office on Tuesday night doing an interview over the Internet. It was a close Schaefer, Mariam told me. Though she is alright and so many others aren't. The explosion wounded thousands of people and hospitals are really struggling to cope. Lebanese people are famously resilient. This shows how strong the Lebanese are, says the man filming this. They keep saying. My family is happy. And there are ways. There were people who've been through so much who've learned to look after themselves. So as they try to pick up the pieces, they're working together to help each other with little faith in their government to do the job. But what now? For the country? Lebanon is already in crisis on multiple fronts. This catastrophic explosion has scarred not just the city skyline, but the psyche of a nation. It's become a symbol of all that's rotten in the political system. And it's left Lebanese people wondering how they're going to get over this and how much death, destruction and despair 1 country can take."

Android: http://goo.gl/RQZUKR","Hey guys. The hell start this over real quick. Hey guys, so by now I'm sure all of you have already heard about all the drama and controversy around. You know, Steve Harvey making the jokes called Asian men. Basically he made some jokes on his show about Asian men and how they're not attractive and this is what it looked like. Do you like Asian men? No, thank you. And obviously there was a lot of drama that followed. There was two different sides of people. Either you know attacking Steve Harvey saying he's racist for making those jokes or people actually defending him and saying, you know he's a comedian and Asians need to learn to just take a joke. And even though I'm Asian and I should be biased. And I really thought about it. I wasn't personally offended by what he said, but I'm not saying what he said was right. I'm just saying, for me personally, I I don't get offended by things like that. I've been hearing in my whole life. Obviously I can see why Asians were offended and are upset about this, and I have to admit I was upset too, but probably for a completely different reason. I wasn't upset by the fact that he was saying Asian men are unattractive. I was upset for just two reasons. First of all, the double standard that exists when it comes to making racist jokes like in our society, it's almost OK to make jokes about Asians like this. I mean, could you imagine if we switch the rows and we had one Asian man playing Steve Harvey and said the things that he said? But about black people on national television? Excuse me, do you like black men? No, thank you. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that Asian guy's career would be over and he probably getting death threats. He'd probably not be able to book another job. There would be significantly more outrage than there was about this Steve Harvey thing, but since the joke was about Asians, it's not as big of a deal because, you know, it's just a joke. I mean, Asians are like the punch bags of society. I could understand if this was like the first time that this ever happened in mainstream media, but let's be real. These kinds of things happen to Asians all the time. I mean, remember during Linsanity and ESPN wrote about Jeremy Lin and he titled the article, a ***** in the armor, obviously making reference to the fact that Jeremy is Asian. And yes, there was a lot of outrage for that. I'm not denying that, still. Again, there were still people with defending the fact that it was a joke, but my point is the fact that anybody would actually think it's OK to title an article, a ***** in the armor when you know it's a non communic sports related article. It's kind of ridiculous. I mean the word change is basically like the N word for Asians. You think anybody would dare to publish the article if they switch out the word ***** with the N word? Of course not, because society and mainstream media has taught us that it's not OK to make black jokes, but it is OK to make Asian jokes. And Steve Harvey is a comedian. It's his job. In fact, if I had to list my favorite black comedians, you know from greatest to worst, Steve Harvey wouldn't be the last one, you know, I'd probably start the top of the list with like Dave Chappelle. Eddie Murphy, Wayne Brady killing Hearts rock Chris Tucker Glover. Bernie Mac Martin Lauren Tracy Morgan Wanda Sykes the entire wins family make 7UP yours guy. Orlando Jones guy that made the guiding vine Bill Cosby, Steve Harvey and then Bill Cosby after the rape allegations. So see Steve is still not at the bottom. Must be real. The guys funny when you got jokes that are straight fire like this one. I don't even like Chinese food. I don't eat what I can't pronounce. Because Chinese food is often in another language C. So sometimes they pronounce things differently and what she said what Steve saying. It's a good job. The funniest part to me is that, you know, as a comedian, he didn't just laugh at his own joke. He was dying from his own joke. I mean, it looked like it was the funniest joke he's ever told or heard. Then again, maybe he wasn't even making a joke. I mean, Chinese food is hard to pronounce. It actually made me kind of curious and I I started thinking like what would it be like to have someone like Steve Harvey, you know, at a Chinese restaurant for lunch? I can't eat anything here. I can't pronounce one thing here, but I wanted to say change Chong Ling Long. It just says spring rolls. Look at this one. Look at this one swing song pong the sweet and sour pork. It's literally 4 English words. What is it? What is it say? Chow Mein. Peking roasted duck. You might have actually said that one correctly for Nope, you're on the drink menu that says Pepsi. Any one thing in this entire country if you can't even pronounce those, there's nothing you can eat in this entire world. Bioworld more like the entire runner up. Yeah, I can't eat anything from this planet, let alone any other planet in this entire runner up you trying to say universe. Oh yeah, my bad. I always mix universe and runner up so I guess we just won't eat lunch then huh? How about we just go to cook? What yeah go ****. It's easy to pronounce so we can go eat it. **** if you want are you swearing at me right now with the restaurant? You know they have like those the gravy mashed potatoes, corn, you know, big old bucket of a a chick fried chicken with a wedding red stripes in the picture of that old guy Collingdale Bernie Sanders on it. I mean KFC. Wow, I cannot believe you just said that you're the one because I'm black. You assume I like KFC, you racist. That was a horrible Steve Harvey impression. I know, I apologize and I know that wasn't a good joke to end on either. So I apologize for that to see, but at least I admit when I have bad jokes. Now I should also say that Steve actually did apologize already. It was a typical PR apology that every celebrity does when they mess up, and you know, he doesn't really mean it because you know when the backlash first started coming. He literally said this kind of beating me up on the Internet right now for no reason, but. You know that's life, right? Please Steve Harvey alone. But anyway overall. Hi there, Steve Harvey was making a lame, tasteless, overused joke that Asians have been hearing all their lives. Or he actually meant what he said and he really does believe that you know, women aren't attracted to Asian males, it's one or the other. And we all can agree that it was just a bad tasteless joke because we know he's not a racist. I mean, he just had a meeting with the President of the United States. So how can he be racist? But our jokes aside, I decided to actually do my own research and see if you know, maybe Steve was on to something. Maybe women don't like Asian men. So what I did is what any logical person on the Internet would do. Taking it to the streets. Excuse me, miss, could I ask you a few questions? It'll only take 5 minutes. Gonna ask you a few simple questions. My first question. If you had to pick between these two individuals, who would you consider to be more attractive? A or B? Probably BA or B? I'm going to have to go with BI. Would go with B. What I'm not gay man in terms of attractiveness like who would you? I like The Walking Dead so sweet be yeah and if you had to pick one of these two individuals, who would you go on? A date with Air BB I'm gonna have to go with B again of course be I love John Cho serious. I mean guess B. Which one would you consider to be sexy or A or BB probably be definitely be no bro be I guess you would have come across one of these next two people randomly on the street right now. Who are you most likely to kiss? A for sure I'm going to have to go with a. Are you sure, yeah. At the definite A. So yeah, the findings were inconclusive. Probably have to just try again another time. Stupid girls."

HELP US REMOVE 30,000,000 POUNDS OF TRASH FROM THE OCEAN BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR!","This is one of the dirtiest beaches in the entire world, and we're going to pick up every single piece of trash on this beach. Starting with this water bottle. One out of millions of pieces of trash. We did it. This will take forever. Bottle me up baby. I'm hungry for your plastic as you can see this is taking forever. Oscar come on in this is Oscar professional beach cleaner. Is this basically how you guys clean beaches? Mainly the big stuff 1st and then we bring a lot of people with sift as well for this little stuff you scoop it into this thing and then shake out the sand and you got a bunch of trash. This right here is the first bag of trash. Hundreds more to go. How do we do this quicker? We just need more people that seem simple. Do you clap for me? There you go on the line here. OK guys, we're gonna be in this stop using the bash. We're gonna clean this up. Groups of four groups of four in this area. Part of me wanted to see if me and the boys could clean up this speech by ourselves and the other part of me realizes that would have taken a year. I could have told you that Jimmy yeah, the oceans putting more trash on the beach. There's so much underwear in the ocean. I'm enacting a new law. Thou shalt not throw your underwear in the ocean. Wait, did you guys already fill up a bag? Yeah, you guys are better than us. They are professionals to be fair. After 12 hours of cleanup, this is what we managed to achieve, which isn't enough. Boys bring it in tomorrow. I'm gonna bring in 10 times the volunteers tomorrow. Tomorrow it's down the next day. I'm helping. Slowly. Mark Rover or Mr. Bean? Make sure you watch until the end of the video to find out how we're going to pick up £30 million of trash. Thank you for coming to our country and help us with this initiative that it's really awesome. Right here, right there stop. He's not stopping. I'm gonna move and this bad boy is 6000 pounds of trash. And now we have £36,000 of trash which weighs the same as 3000 cats or 3T rexes, whichever you prefer. While I was talking with some of the locals, they mentioned that there's a beach down the street that was also very dirty, so I said Nolan with a bunch of volunteers to go clean that beach as well. There's a whole car bumps that car bumper here to this come out of the ocean. People litter weird things. What type of trash have you seen along the beach? Most importantly most commonly is plastics and we see that in every form on the beach here, they ended up removing 12,000 pounds of trash. Which brought us up to a total of £50,000 of trash from just two beaches. Check out this power move watch this OK, that is that how you want us to dump it. Yeah, they're not taking over the team. I'm the team player. Oh yeah, I didn't have to look there you go. It actually kind of works. Yeah. And if you guys look over there, we're actually getting close to the end of the beach. This is what the beach looked like at the start of the video and this is what it looks like with like 20% left. We're getting there. We're doing it. Unfortunately, between the ocean washing up trash to the beach and rivers, bringing in new trash from the mainland. Obviously this beach is gonna get dirty again, but with your guys help we can stop a much bigger issue. We're almost done Jimmy. I know four straight days of picking up trash and just like that we were moved over 60,000 pounds of trash from the world's dirtiest beach. And even though this 60,000 pounds of trash we picked up my seem impressive, there is sadly way too much trash still in the ocean. Two years ago we crushed our goals with team trees and planted 20 million trees and now it's time to do it again, which is why we, along with hundreds of other creators, are launching team. And for every $1.00 you guys stone it like this one, less pounder trash will be in the ocean. But what if I wanted to donate $10 Jimmy? I conveniently have £10 of trash right here that is now out of the ocean, boom gone. You get the point. $1.00 donated is 1 less pound of trash in the ocean and I'd like to personally thank You Tube originals for supporting team season, helping US fund it. They're going to be matching the 1st $400,000 worth of donations, dollar for dollar and we want to remove £30 million of trash from the ocean, which is just so freaking audacious. This only happens if we all work together. Half the money we raise is going towards funding. Volunteer beach clean ups like we did here today. All across the world as well as literally fishing trash out of the ocean and the other half will be used for these trash eating robots that pick up trash 24 hours a day, 365 days a year from rivers that flow to the ocean. Go to teensies.org or click the donate button below this video. Right now, $1.00 equals one last round of trash in the ocean, making real change like this isn't gonna be easy. Donate right now and help us remove £30 million of trash from the ocean before the end of the year. Let's show the world that we want a clean ocean. What are you doing? Get out of here. Go donate."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZHt_m5uG2s,Boris Johnson: Will PM survive Partygate scandal?,"The Commons has not seen a day like this since Boris Johnson led the Tories to a convincing election victory in 2019, but the comfort of a parliamentary majority has now been shattered and replaced by one political crisis after another. (Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) 

The abiding image of Downing Street might be a wine fridge, overpriced wallpaper and a prime minister who looks on the verge of tears. 

Boris Johnson has shrugged off many scandals in the past. But can he possibly survive this?  
-----------------------  
Follow us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/Channel4News","This was Boris Johnson, less than three years ago. The self appointed savior of Brexit, the messy haired rebel and above all else, the election winner. So what's changed less than a year into his premiership? A pandemic forcing a famous freedom lover with a reputation for bending rules to start making them and make sure everyone else followed them as well to stay at home. Protect our NHS and save lives. It's a role that he has sometimes struggled with and quickly led to the first big misstep of his premiership. When his top adviser embarked on a controversial journey during the height of COVID, he backed him. Is it one rule for you Mr. Cummings and another rule for everybody else, and let him give this confusing account in a press conference in the Downing St Garden, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barncastle town. It led to public anger and lots of funny videos. So you see my visions a bit of a hassle, and having endured months of the damaging fallout that followed, he sacked him anyway, but the end of Dominic Cummings rain in Downing St was just the start of more self inflicted wounds that left some Tory MP's asking was their leader losing his touch when the sudden need for gold wallpaper and other expensive furnishings to do up the Downing St flat turned into an investigation into who paid for it. And when a speech to business leaders turned into a lot of paper shuffling and Peppa Pig promotion. Uh. He's been to Peppa Pig world. Not enough, and when one of his MPs became embroiled in a lobbying scandal and his first move was to try to change the rules to save him. When you know when we come to sort of to write the 100 days or whatever that destroyed Boris Johnson, I think we will start with the own Patterson vote. Because. Actually, all sorts of things, all sorts of things that are going on in there right now are traced back to telling Tory MPs that they needed to vote to save our in Paterson. And lots of them thinking. Is this a good idea? It's that thing of. Being doing the wrong thing when the when the public paid attention and. Honestly, am I surprised that Boris Johnson was doing the wrong thing when the public paid attention? No, I'm not. But in the end it is parties that have brought this Prime Minister to the brink, the Downing St Party scandal properly kicked off with this leaked video of the Prime Minister, spokeswoman, Allegra Stratton. Business meeting and it was not socially distanced. Laughter That quickly turned to tears. I'm truly sorry, and this afternoon I am offering my resignation to the Prime Minister and as more information emerged, party gate was propelled onto primetime TV evening Prime Minister. So now during this. It's been nonstop allegations, apologies and explanations. I'm I I'm I'm sick and myself and furious about that. I believed implicitly that this was a work event that nobody said that this was something that was against the rules. He entered the House of Commons today, amid rumors that his own party is plotting to replace him at any moment. But Boris Johnson has been through more difficult periods in politics than most. And has an unusual ability to endure them. So although he may have looked down, he's certainly not out yet."

You've been with us a great deal. Your perspective has been key and fundamental. After what you've just heard from the Secretary of State. What are your feelings tonight? Yeah, first I wanna start by saying I'm my thoughts and prayers and my love and and supporting everything you need is with the families of 13 heroes. We lost them. I'm easy to find if any of those families need anything from me, please let me know. I'm there to help you in any way I can in the organization that I support. Or no, we're here for you. Secondly, I'd like to say to the thousands of people that fled Afghanistan because you helped us and you believed in us. We're here to welcome you and anything I can do for you. Please let me know. And lastly, I'll say for every single veteran out there and Gold Star family who bled. And said pounds of flesh like I did for this war. I love you and I appreciate you. I can't tell you tonight that your service and sacrifice meant what you thought it did. When you, when you were there. I, I can't tell you tonight that it meant that our country would be safer. I can't tell you tonight that it meant we would search down and kill the people that tried to kill us. 'cause I just don't know if that mission is accomplished. But what I can tell you is every single one of us that bled and and now they took some fainting breaths or even last breaths there. We did it because we knew the people to our left and right would do it for us. And if that's what it took, if it took us dying so they would go home, then by God that was worth it. So when everyone out there to understand that's what it was worth it. I don't know if the mission laid out by our leaders and our government was accomplished or even full heartedly attempted to be accomplished. I just don't know that I don't trust politicians and I don't trust this type of diplomacy any further than I can throw it in a gal with no legs. Can't throw real far. But I will tell you, I believe in the men and women I served with. I believe in the in the pureness of our intent and when the Secretary of State stands up there and tells me that the people who killed my brothers and took my legs can earn our trust. Yeah well thank God this is television news and not just a casual conversation 'cause I'd have words for him. Nobody wants to hear. Well I think I'm. I also know some pretty harsh words which we we both are gonna keep to ourselves. I can tell you Sir, this is though a reminder that leadership matters, doesn't it? You know that is a military man. We know that in life this is. Leadership matters. We know this is not a reflection of this country or of our military, or of the American people, and that is what is so shocking that we are willing to make sacrifices. You you did so, and everyone else is willing to this was shocking. Is none of this had to happen. This was not a natural end to what this we all wanted to be out of there, but not like running away to to cut are not running away. And then and gaslighting the American people about what is or is not happening. Let alone abandoning, we abandoned people from four with an arbitrary deadline. Is that how do we? How do we? How do we process that? What do you say to people? I just hope the American people understand something that's really special about this country. Blood is the easiest currency to acquire. We offer it up freely. We volunteer to serve this military and I don't know many that volunteered in the last 20 years. That didn't beg to go into deployment. You can get blood really easy, but the interest on that payment, the interest on that currency lasts a lifetime. Yeah, 'cause those are broken hearts that that that ripple throughout this country. And so the next time a politician stands at that bully pulpit and promises you. Something like a war. Ask questions and have consequences at the ballot box 'cause we know now. Regardless of party, we can't trust them. And before we send our sons and daughters, we need to know why and where they're going and how they're going to get back. This is completely at clearly nonpartisan. I'm a partisan for America. You are as well. This is about the human condition and and what the greatest country on Earth in which we wake up in every single day. Thank God is capable of doing Joey. I want you to listen to something from General McKenzie. With CENTCOM giving praise to the Taliban, listen to this. The Taliban have been very pregnant, very pragmatic and very businesslike as we have approached this withdrawal. They were actually very helpful and useful to us as we closed down operations. Absolutely standing. These are people who also are. Still there's one family, at least out there, begging Joe Biden to get an American back. Who's who was kidnapped by the Taliban over a year ago. They're still holding Americans. What do you make of a man in uniform who makes a statement like that about the enemy? That's that you can say on television stuff. Yeah, that's tough. I I don't know that man, I didn't. As far as I know, I didn't serve under his command. I don't know what political pressure on his shoulders. But I know what it means to be a marine. I know what it means to bleed with men and women and to hold their hand when they're taking their last breath, and to do everything I can. Everything in me if it means walking down and leaning over a bomb and taking a damn good guess to keep them alive, even if that means I get blown into pieces. That's OK, and I'll tell you right now, I'd never look them in the face, even if the President United States who was my boss at the time, told me to, and say some trash like that about the people trying to kill him. You can say that you are proud of this mission. We just accomplished as far as airlifting 100,000 people out of a country that's about to go to ruin, but to go so far as to be a spin doctor for an organization that literally tortures people, oppresses them, and kills them. How dare you and how dare you ever ever look troops in the face again and order them into combat? You don't deserve it. You just don't get to do that. You don't get to play both sides of the ball when you put that uniform on. Can you ask our 18 to 19 year olds to go bleed and die for this country even if we're smart enough to know it's a 'cause? That doesn't mean anything to you and I I don't mean the general, but to our politicians he even if we're smart enough to understand the politics behind it, we raise our right hand and we do it because we do it with honor and we do it because we love this country and we do it because even if it's some partisan war, if it can keep our enemy at Bay for one more day, that's worth it. And how dare you think that you can lead troops and stand up there and speak glowingly about the people who have tried to kill us for 20 years? How just how dare you do that. It is shocking. Listen with if you want to withdraw and and botch it, turn it into an evacuation, sure, and spin on that. That's OK. Listen. I am proud of the men and women that got everyone out of there. But to go so far as to brag on the Taliban. That's just it's. It's betrayal is what it is. It is. And if there is a point where you have to do that. Or you could resign in protest where there is this understanding about what is appropriate, what decency really is. It's hard enough with. Everyone who served you and your brothers and sisters now watching this collapse, but then to praise the people as they stood there and aided Al Qaeda and aided bin Laden as the as we are just within a couple of weeks of the anniversary of September 11th. It is remarkable. It is also, Sir, I think you would agree with me unacceptable. God bless you Joey. It is an honor to be even remotely associated with you keep up the great work. I know. Of course prayers for you and for everyone. It is difficult, but we're strong people. We know there needs to be some changes and you're in the forefront of reminding us why. Thank you, Sir. Thank you and don't forget about those still recovering from that bomb that they didn't weren't killed by it. We need to pray for them. Yes, we've got a lot of a few of our troops I know have already been transferred here to the United States. Families are asking for prayers for the seriously injured and that must be on our forefront of our minds as well. Thank you Joey. Hey Sean Hannity here.

This has been a complete shock for our community. Our coastline is our backyard and to have a tragic death under such horrifying circumstances is, you know, completely shocking. Our community is really gonna pause and just reflect and look. It's been a shock for everyone. I think to close them for safety, yes, and until it's safe to go back in swimming and people generally respect that you get the few crazy surfers. It'll still go out.

The president hasn't had a week like this since his disgraceful and deadly retreat from Kabul. He saw his entire agenda fall apart in real time these past seven days and even someone is out of it as Sleepy Joe has to realize things are getting bad on Monday. the US shattered records with over 1.3 million COVID cases. In a single day, for the guy who promised America, he would shut down the virus. It seems like he's doing the exact opposite. So Biden week started off well for one on Tuesday. Things only got worse for the embattled President Biden went down to Georgia to attack the filibuster. I believe the threat to our democracy is so grave. That we must find a way to pass these voting rights. Bill we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this. Biden speech caught flak from both sides of the aisle as he trashed Senate rules and looked to smear any American who cares about election integrity as a racist. So if you're keeping score at home, that's oh and two for Biden this week. And if you thought things were getting getting any better as the week moved on, think again. On Wednesday, the Labor Department announced the Consumer Price Index jumped 7% in December, the worst since 1982 thanks to Biden. Pork anomic policies prices. Are the highest they've been in 40 years. Now you know how your wallet's been feeling a little light lately. Well, you can thank Joe Biden for that, and the pain didn't stop there as the release of a new poll highlighted Biden's fall from grace. His job performance rating hit a new low with only 33% of Americans saying they approve of Biden and more than 50% disapproving. And that was only Wednesday. Which brings us here to yesterday where it was a Thursday to forget for this administration, Kamala Harris didn't do her boss any favors when she sat down for a one on one with NBC. She got tripped up on what should have been a pretty obvious question. It sounded like a beauty pageant contestant who would? Who's thrown a curveball in an interview? At what point does the administration say you know what the strategy isn't working? We're gonna change strategies, is it Tom? It is time for us to do what we have been doing in that time is every day. Every day it is time for us to agree that there are things and tools that are available to us to slow this thing down. But this train wreck of an interview by his second in command just continued. Biden's no good, terrible Thursday Joes vaccine mandate on private businesses, which would have affected more than 80 million Americans, was shot down by the Supreme Court, the nation's highest court told Biden that our personal freedoms outweighed his executive overreach. So as Thursday came to a close, Biden was looking at an over four week and this morning there was no reprieve. As the pain continued for Joe Biden was forced to admit that he hasn't done a whole lot as president. There's a lot of talk about. Disappointments and things. We haven't gotten done. We're gonna get a lot of them done, I might add. That's pretty rich, Joe. He admits he hasn't done anything to help the people who elected him but then slips into a. I don't worry, we'll get it done. Unfortunately, we don't believe you, Joe. And things are getting so bad for Biden that even his trusty leftist media has turned on him. President Joe Biden has had a very tough week with setbacks for his agenda. Every time I think the White House thought they've hit bottom, there seems to be a new bottom. The overall sentiment, not just among the American public, but even among Democrats in Washington. People who are allies of this administration is that this is a really bad period for the Biden administration. The Biden administration continues to fail every step of the way, and even the left can't hide it anymore. So here's the important question, what is the White House going to do about it? Well, it doesn't look like they have a plan at all. If anything, their frustration is reaching critical levels. You do hard things in white houses. You have every challenge at your at your feet laid at your feet, whether it's global or domestically. And we could certainly propose legislation to see if people. Support Bunny rabbits and ice cream. But that wouldn't be very rewarding to the American people. Bunny, rabbits and ice cream. That's what the White House has come to. Well, it's so clear that they are in over their heads. They can't handle the crisis that they're currently facing. So what happens when a new crisis arrives? Like the mother of all supply chain problems that is emerging right now in China? We're still feeling the pain from our current supply chain crisis and another supply bubble is ready to burst. Kanamits are warning that if COVID continues to spread across Asia, the disruption to manufacturing could be. Catastrophic, as we're too reliant on China to make the things that we need. It's been a very bad week for Joe Biden. Probably the worst seven days of his presidency. He saw America's institutions and people reject everything. He campaigned on nearly one year after his inauguration. Joe Biden Presidency has hit a breaking point. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

Business Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com","Hey guys, with summer right around the corner and me not taking care of my bikini line this winter, I'm going to show you my treatment plan to take care of ingrown hairs, dark Marks and I'm going to talk about hair removal. This is my bikini line rehab. I hope you guys enjoy. Hair removal is always optional, but if you're watching this video, I'm assuming you're interested in removing hair. You have a couple of options in my opinion. I would stick to shaving or waxing. I don't know much about epilators, and of course laser hair removal is always an option, but that requires a ton of commitment and a lot of cash. If you've never seen my how to shave perfectly video, you can watch that and you'll see that it's really easy to learn. It's great for daily maintenance, and of course it's accessible. Which is the best. So this isn't going to be a hair removal tutorial. I'm going to talk about how to bring your bikini line from not good to good now when I shave, no matter what, even if it's a fresh blade and a fresh shave, I still get those dots around the bikini line because the hair still remains under the poor. And if it's dark and thick enough like mine, it's going to show up. But what makes everything worse is that it's itchy when it grows back, my hair is so thick. But when it pokes through the skin, it really itches and it's uncomfortable, so I had to give up shaving altogether and switch to waxing. Waxing is not just a way to remove hair, it's a way to improve the bikini line in the appearance of it, I had a really bad bikini line visual going on before I started waxing, and I've noticed a huge improvement, but I do have to mention this is not one of the areas of my body that I am comfortable waxing on my own. I advise that you never try to do your own bikini line or especially Brazilian. It will be a mess. It's just too painful to complete on your own. Professionals are really used to doing it, and it's actually a lot more comfortable going in for the service than I thought it would be. I go for a Brazilian where they remove everything between the cheeks and the front and just anything in the ***** line. This improves like my entire life because the hair comes back thinner. It lasts a really long time. I only go in every two months and in this video you guys are seeing some of the hair follicles are actually starting to grow back, so this is after a month and a half and once I see those black dots starting to form, I know that the hair is finally grown back. The great thing about waxing is it takes the hair right from the roots so it does take a long time for those. Black dots to return and eventually the hair will poke out and you can go for your next wax. The bad thing about waxing is you have to wait so your bikini line will look like this sometimes, huh? OK, now that we've talked about hair removal, let's talk about some more serious bikini line issues. I usually get ingrown hairs that look like this one on the right the most often. What you can do to prevent these is exfoliate, but if you're shaving, I do have to mention that you need to replace your blade a lot more quickly, and that's if you're experiencing razor bumps or ingrown hairs only. There's a lot of follow up and aftercare that comes with both shaving. And waxing, and that's when I want to focus on in this video. So first I'm going to talk about exfoliating. You can use either a loofah or a nice scrub that you have. I like to use a sugar scrub my friend. This really effective on the lower half and all over the body. Actually what I'm going to show you is the more effective way to exfoliate your skin. So something funny. We've all been told to exfoliate the wrong way when it comes to the bikini line, the little small circular motions that were advised to use on our face and body actually causes a lot of damage and causes ingrown hairs. So I'm going to show you something when you're exfoliating. Only go in and up and down motion. Be gentle or rough, whatever your skin likes depending on how sensitive it is, but make sure you don't go back and forth or around in a circle. This causes ingrown hairs because it confuses the hairs as they start to grow in. They don't know which direction to go, so when you're going up and down, your encouraging the hair to be able to poke through the skin, which is really important. This will definitely eliminate ingrown hairs, and it will also encourage the hair to poke through comfortably so you won't be itchy if you do shave, I recommend exfoliating 2 times a week at least. This product is awesome. It actually does what it says. This is one of those drugstore favorites of mine. It's a really unsexy bottle, but it does remove razor bumps and ingrown hairs. I just toss some of this onto a cotton pad and then I apply it fresh out of the shower to my skin and it works like a dream. I don't always remember to use it, but when I do I always see a big difference. If you shave regularly, I recommend this being one of your number one products and wait for the green product. If you're a waxer because I like that one a little bit more for daily use. Next, we're going to talk about dark spots. I get a lot of darkness in the bikini line when I don't take care of it. One of the easiest things I've noticed is to make a change in the color of my underwear. Wear a light colored underwear and make sure that it's 95% cotton. At least this is a lot more breathable and there's no harsh dyes that are going to be really dark on the skin, leaving a dark pigmentation on the bikini line. I also like seeing really comfortable lace on the edge of the ***** line because it means it's going to be more comfortable on the bikini area and it's not going to be harsh if you've just shaved. OK, here's the green product I was talking about. This one is a lot more hydrating than the one I mentioned before. I really like this. If you're a regular waxer, definitely try this one. If you need the extra power then go for the 10 skin, but this one is a lot more hydrating, which I love. What I do is I apply this fresh out of the shower just like the other one and it removes darkness around the bikini line as well as prevents ingrown hairs. So this one is like a do it all. Hydration is the number one way to eliminate dark areas as well as creating some type of exfoliation to the area so that you can give your skin the opportunity to renew. What I'm using here is a derma roller. So what I do is I roll this across my skin. It's got a ton of needles on it and they're just thin enough to not be painful, but create a little bit of abrasion on the skin. A little bit of damage, which is going to make it have to renew itself. So you're going to create a little bit of damage to that when you go to sleep. Your skin is going to regrow and when it regrows it's going to be brighter and it's going to be without the scars. So if you've got scars like I do from shaving or whatever, don't worry about it. Just make sure you don't have any active pimples that are really red and pusy. Because Dermarolling is not meant for that, I will do a video if you guys want to see how to take care of and how to use your derma roller. I'll do that next if you want. Just give this video a thumbs up like I mentioned, moisturizing is the number one way to make sure that your skin doesn't get any darkness. After removing the hair, so use something that's really gentle, preferably without fragrance. This one has a scent, but it's natural and I really like this. You can just apply this to the skin after you've removed the hair and on a daily basis, just like you would put moisturizer on your skin that concludes my bikini line rehab with all of the tips. And habits that you can start to create a better looking bikini line. It's really hard to have a perfect bikini line. Don't pressure yourself. It's just silly. We all grow hair and it's perfectly normal. I hope you guys feel really great about this video and I hope that you feel like you can take care of yourself a little bit better. If you enjoyed this video, please subscribe to my channel and give this a thumbs up. I love you and I'll see you next video."

Can you grow a human bone outside the human body? The answer may soon be yes. Nina Tandon explores the possibility by examining how bones naturally grow inside the body, and illuminating how scientists are hoping to replicate that process in a lab.

Lesson by Nina Tandon, animation by Giant Animation Studios.","Can you grow a human bone outside the human body? The answer may soon be yes, but before we can understand how that's possible, we need to look at how bones grow naturally inside the body. Most bones start in a growing fetus as a soft, flexible cartilage bone, forming cells replace the cartilage with a spongy mineral lattice made of elements like calcium and phosphate. This lattice gets harder as osteoblasts, which are specialized bone forming cells deposit more mineral giving bones their strength. While the lattice itself is not made of living cells, networks of blood vessels, nerves, and other living tissues grow through special channels and passages and over the course of development, a legion of osteoblasts reinforce the skeleton that protects our organs, allows us to move, produces blood cells and more. But this initial building process alone is not enough to make bones strong and functional. If you took a bone built this way, attached muscles to it and tried to use it to lift a heavyweight, the bone would probably snap under the strain. This doesn't usually happen to us because our cells are constantly reinforcing and building bone wherever they're used. A principle we refer to as wolfs law. However, bone materials are a limited resource and this new reinforcing bone can be formed only if there is enough material present. Fortunately, osteoblasts. The builders have a counterpart called Osteoclast's. The recyclers. Osteoclasts breakdown the unneeded mineral lattice using acids and enzymes so that osteoblasts can then add more material. One of the main reasons astronauts must exercise constantly in orbit is due to the lack of skeletal strain in freefall. As projected by Wolff's law, that makes Osteoclast's more active than osteoblasts, resulting in a loss of bone mass and strength. When bones do break, your body has an amazing ability to reconstruct the injured bone, as if the break had never happened. Certain situations like cancer removal, traumatic accidents, and genetic defects exceed the body's natural ability for repair. Historical solutions have included filling in the resulting holes with metal animal bones or pieces of bone from human donors, but none of these are optimal as they can cause infections or be rejected by the immune system and they can't carry out most of the functions of healthy bones. An ideal solution would be to grow a bone made from the patient's own cells that's customized to the exact shape of the hull, and that's exactly what scientists are currently trying to do. Here's how it works. First, doctors extract stem cells from a patient fat tissue and take CT scans to determine the exact dimensions of the missing bone. They then model the exact shape of the hull, either with 3D printers or by carving decellularized cow bones. Those are the bones where all of the cells have been stripped away, leaving only the sponge like mineral lattice. They then add the patient stem cells to this lattice and place it in a bioreactor, a device that will simulate all of the conditions found inside the body. Temperature, humidity, acidity, and nutrient composition all need to be just right for the stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts and other cells colonize the mineral lattice and remodel it with living tissue. But there's one thing missing, remember, will flaw in artificial bone needs to experience real stress or else it will come out weak and brittle so the bioreactor constantly pumps fluids around the bone and the pressure tells the osteoblasts to add bone density. Put all of this together and within three weeks the now living bone is ready to come out of the bioreactor and to be implanted into the patient's body. While it isn't yet certain that this method will work for humans, lab grown bones have already been successfully implanted in pigs and other animals, and human trials may begin as early as 2016."

--

On top of our heads, there is a type of yeast that lives and dines on all of our scalps. Feasting constantly, it’s in paradise. And in about half of the human population, its activity causes dandruff. So, why do some people have more dandruff than others? And how can it be treated? Thomas L. Dawson explores this head-scratching problem.

It's in paradise. Wait, what's this? In fact, Malicia is a type of yeast that lives and dines on all of our scalps and in about half of the human population. Its activity. Causes dandruff, so why do some people have more dandruff than others? And how can it be treated? We might consider ourselves individuals, but we're really colonies. Our skin hosts billions of microbes, malassezia yeasts make themselves at home on our skin shortly after we're born follicles. The tiny cavities that grow hairs all over our body make for especially popular living quarters. Malassezia are fond of these hideouts because they contain glands that secrete an oil called sebum that's thought. To lubricate and strengthen our hair. Malassezia evolved to consume our skins, proteins and oils, and because of its many sebum secreting follicles, our scalp is one of the oiliest places on our body and consequently one of the yeasty is. As these fungi feast on our scalp oils, dandruff may form. This is because sebum is composed of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, saturated fats neatly packed together unsaturated fats. On the other hand, contain double bonds that create an irregular kink in their structure. Malassezia eat sebum by secreting an enzyme that releases all of the oils fatty acids, but they only consume the saturated fats, leaving the unsaturated ones behind. These irregularly shaped leftovers soak into the skin and pry its barrier open, allowing water to escape. The body detects these breaches and responds defensively causing the inflammation that gives dandruff its itch. It also makes the skin cells proliferate to repair the damaged barrier. Usually our skin's outer surface or epidermis completely renews itself every two to three weeks. Epidermal cells divide, move outwards, die and form the skins. Tough outer layer which gradually sheds off in single cells far too small to see. But with dandruff cells churn out quickly to correct the broken barrier, meaning they don't mature and differentiate properly. Instead they form large greasy clumps around the hair follicle. That are shed as visible flakes. This is how malassezia is voracious appetite and our bodies reaction to its by products lead to dandruff. Currently the most effective way to get rid of dandruff is by using antifungals in things like shampoos applied directly to the scalp to kill malassezia. For those who experience STENDRA it usually comes and goes as sebum secretions vary throughout one's lifetime due to hormonal changes. But despite the fact that. Malicia colonized everyone to a similar extent. Not everyone gets dandruff. Some people are more susceptible. Exactly why is unclear. Do people with dandruff have a certain genetic predisposition? Is their skin barrier more permeable? Scientists are currently investigating. If people with dandruff do in fact lose more water through their scalps, and whether this is what's leading their skin cells to proliferate. Researchers are learning that malassezia communicate with our immune system using small oily molecules called oxylipins that regulate inflammation. If they can find a way to inhibit inflammatory oxylipins and boost anti inflammatory ones, they could develop new treatments. Scientists are also investigating if there's any benefit to our relationship with malassezia. They hypothesize that dandruff, which can be uncomfortable and embarrassing for us, creates a reliable oily food source for the yeast. But dandruff isn't contagious or a great threat to our health, and malassezia seem to excel at defending their territory. Our skin from other, more harmful microbes like Staphylococcus orixas. So while scientists have gotten to the bottom of many mysteries surrounding this condition, it must be said dandruff remains a head scratcher. Dandruff isn't the only unpleasant condition that microbes and our bodies conspire to create. If you could eradicate body odor or bad breath, which would you choose?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0ZabxXmH4Y,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),"What do you know about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that is causing a health emergency? 

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans (SARS-CoV-2). To find out more, watch this short video which was revised on 15 June 2020 to reflect the evolving context.

Learn about OpenWHO, WHO’s interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies here: https://openwho.org/","In December 2019, there was a cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan in China. Some of the early cases had reported visiting or working in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan. Investigations found that the disease was caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The disease was subsequently named COVID-19 COVID-19 spread within China and to the rest of the world on 30 January 2020. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. In this video, we'll take a quick look at what is currently known about COVID-19. Keep in mind that this is a new disease and what's known is rapidly evolving and might change in the future. So what is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses. They consist of a core of genetic material surrounded by a lipid envelope with protein spikes. This gives it the appearance of a crown. Crown in Latin is called Corona, and that's how these viruses get their name. There are different types of corona viruses that cause illness in animals and humans in humans. Coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. These include the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first identified in China in 2003, the Middle East, respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and SARS Co V2. The name of the virus that causes COVID-19 that was first reported in December 2019. So where did this new virus come from? It's known that coronaviruses circulate in a range of animals. Sometimes these viruses can make the jump from animals to humans. This is called a spillover and could be due to a range of factors such as mutations in the virus or increased contact between humans and animals. For example, MERS Co V is known to be transmitted from camels and SARS, Co V from civet cats, the animal reservoir of the new coronavirus is not known yet. How does the disease spread? The disease can spread from person to person through droplets. When an infected person releases those droplets through coughing, talking or sneezing. For example, when close to another person, it can also spread. When infected droplets land on objects, and when another person touches them and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. What are the symptoms? The incubation period, which is the time taken from exposure to the virus and development of symptoms, is on average five to six days, but can range from 1 to 14 days. There can be a range of symptoms from very mild to severe. Some people may not develop symptoms. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath. Some people reported loss of their sense of taste or smell, and some may develop a skin rash. In more severe cases, there could be pneumonia, organ failure and sometimes death. About 80% of cases recover from the disease without needing special treatment, but there are some people who are at risk of serious illness. They include older people or people with underlying medical problems such as chronic respiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or cancer. How can we tell whether someone is infected? The infection is commonly diagnosed by a test called reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, generally known as PCR. This test identifies the virus based on its genetic fingerprint. There's also a blood test that can check for antibodies against the virus, which may show that someone was infected in the past. How is it treated? The treatment for COVID-19 is mainly supportive care medicines against the virus are currently under investigation. How do we prevent transmission of the virus? There are a number of effective ways to prevent the spread of the disease. These include covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing with a flexed elbow or tissue, and throwing the tissue in a closed bin immediately after use. Wash hands regularly with soap and water or an alcohol based hand rub, maintaining at least 1 meter distance from people and the appropriate use of masks and personal protective equipment, especially in health settings. It's important to stay home if you're feeling unwell and to call a hotline or your medical professional. But if you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early and share your travel history or contact with someone unwell with your health care provider. In some areas, governments have implemented specific physical and social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the outbreak. It's important to follow their advice. Vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are currently under development, and scientists around the world are working hard to make this happen. That's a quick look at this emerging infectious disease. We're still learning about this virus every day, and what's known may change, so please check the website below for the most up-to-date information."

The writing says that only people with a pure heart can live in the place, where love and wisdom are the rulers.","Calke is the final incarnation of Lord Vishnu in ancient Hindu scriptures. Shambhala is said to be Kalki's birthplace. Shambhala is a mythical paradise that is constantly spoken in ancient Hindu scriptures including Karl Chakra tantrum and ancient writing such as the Zhangjiang culture which spread Buddhism in western Tibet. The word has a subscript root which means place of peace or place of silence. The legend says that only people with pure heart can live in the place. We love and wisdom are the rulers. It is believed that Kalki appears at the end of Kalyug according to the Hindu scriptures. Universal time is composed of four main periods or yuggs satyug, Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga and Kellogg. Human beings are currently living in the Klu. Which lasts approximately 432,000 years. This. Began after the Battle of Kurukshetra. At the end of King Parikshit region some 5000 years ago there for approximately 427,000 years of kalyug remain before it is said that Kalki will come. Parents predict that Kalki will be on a winged White Horse and a radiant sword. It is believed that Kalki will cause the destruction of the world when humanity completely abandons morale when nothing is known about sacrifice techniques even in words. Coccia stars mission is to restore justice and good principles which disappeared at the end of college. The Iron Age of hypocrisy and struggle at the end of Kalyug, the population of the whole world will be so reduced to minimalism that there will be no more power to understand what term or add harm is. And it's already there. Kuluk people will not have the power to understand philosophy consciousness then at that time when there are no more good principles, no humanity left, then there is no alternative. At that moment, Kalki Safdar will arrive and he will take a sword on a horseback. He will simply continue to kill all these evil and adharmic creatures and marked the beginning of another satyug, the Golden Age of Righteousness and truth. Nostradamus prediction about Lord Kalki. Nostradamus was a great astrologer and whatever he had predicted had always come true. According to his prediction, it was discovered. That a person will bear with immense power in the world who's holy day will be Thursday and will rule throughout the world. Both of land and sea. He will be the only person who will free the world from all problems. According to Nostradamus, this great person will come down from his throne and will move through the sea and air for striking the evil once with his rod. According to Srimad Bhagwad Gita, Lord Kalki has many similarities to what Nostradamus had predicted. Who would not agree that the Earth has undergone extraordinary deterioration? Of its biosphere. Who could argue that living a pure life on Earth becomes more difficult and challenging with each passing year? Who has not shouted about social degeneration and political turmoil? Financial chaos and pain and suffering caused by endless wars.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P596EkLY_9U,When Did Exactly Mahabharata War Happen?,"According to the evidence from Geology, three different catastrophic events occurred, one near the Caribbean, one in Istanbul, and the last in Dwaraka. According to the survey, these catastrophic events occurred at the same time. The chronology of these exact dates establishes that all the Hindu kings who have ruled Hastinapur since Yudhishthir are the strongest evidence that anyone could understand. Therefore, it is shown that the Mahabharata war took place during 3139 BC. C. C., that is, 5,159 years ago.","DQ Shetra War, also known as the Mahabharata War. One of the epic wars of all time. This war has taken place in the northern part of India in Kurukshetra, but the actual date of the war is still a great mystery to all of us. We still rely on our ancient astrological methods to find the dates. These methods were written in a 48 page date wise journal that consisted of all astrological facts and figures called visual panchang. This book was published by the Kashi Hindu Vishwavidyalaya Varanasi in the year 1925. It states about all the three eras the Kelly era, the Vikram era and the Shark era in detail. Even to this day, the history of the Mahabharata war continues to be a subject of discussion. It remains to be a part of a subject of great challenge and controversies as the dates of the war and the Caliope Cali oak have been elusive for two centuries. The oldest known suggestion dates back to Aryabhatt. Aryabhatt, one of the greatest astronomer and mathematician of the century, was born in 1476 CE. His work in astronomy has become an asset to all scholars. He is known for the discovery of accurate value of Pi. He has also written a book called Arabati during 499 eighty which gives us the exact information about the beginning of colleague. In his book he has explained in detail that he was 23 years old when the three yolks, namely Satyug, Treta Joghd, Whopper Yoga and 3600 years of kale yoga have passed. In general, he states that he was 23 years old during the 3601 first year of Cali Era, hence concluding the fact that 3102 BC was the beginning of the Kellogg. Kellogg has been. Vegan as the root era to determine the chronological dates of events, kings, divine dignitaries, and supreme personality of our history. It has been a known fact to all that the KALLIOPE stated approximately about 5000 years ago. We had hundred of these proofs regarding the dates of the Mahabharat War and the beginning of the kalyug in our history books that were destroyed by the British and Muggles. But we still have more than enough material to fully establish the fact when Lord Krishna left Earth to extend his divine Adobe, the town of Dwarka was drowned and destroyed by catastrophic rain storm and flood that lasted for seven whole days. It happened 36 years after Mahabharata war according to the geology, evidence 3 distinct catastrophic rise events happened 1 near the Caribbean. Another one happened in Istanbul and the last one is Dwarka. As per the research, these catastrophic events had taken place at the same time. The chronology of these exact dates states that all the Hindu kings who ruled Hastinapur since Yudhishthir is the most potent evidence that could be understood by anyone, hence proving the Mahabharat war happened during 3139BC means 5159 years ago.

#BBCNews","With just over a month to go until the Tokyo Olympics, Japan has just announced it is lifting its coronavirus state of emergency in the capital this weekend. From Sunday there will be relaxed restrictions on alcohol services and bars and restaurants. Some restrictions will still remain in place, though the current state of emergency allows only 5000 people or 50% of venue capacity, whichever is smaller. The government now saying that areas not under any restrictions can have up to 10,000 fans. Despite this, Sir, the Prime Minister asked people to watch the Olympics at home. He said, lifting the state of emergency is possible due to a recent drop in infections in Japan. Total number of infections in the country has been declining since the middle of May. The number of people in critical condition is also decreasing. What do you miss? Hippo taking your conscious. Abandon O'Connell. Cueshe joke Hokkaido. That was the Prime Minister speaking just a short time ago. We're still monitoring this press conference as it's underway. Right now it's quite a long one that the Prime Minister is delivering to the nation. He has just said that the country is getting closer to herd immunity as the pace of vaccination picks up. So that's just coming to us from the Prime Minister to remind you just over 6% of the population is fully vaccinated so far. Well, also, watching this press conference is Richard Lloyd Parry Asia editor. For the Times newspaper and he joins me now. So a big moment Richard, with the lifting of these restrictions and the state of emergency, will it prove controversial? Not really, I think this is what many people expected. Going ahead with the Olympics, that's controversial and the timing of this announcement. I think no one could deny it very closely. Tide up with that decision and what this does is in some ways encapsulates the dilemma facing the Japanese government as it presses on with the Olympics because it would look very bad to go ahead with the Olympics, the world biggest sporting event of the world's most popular city. Tokyo, if that city was under an official state of emergency, but on the other hand, once they remove the state of emergency, I think everyone expects that the the number of daily infections will start to go up again and five weeks from now we're in the Olympics, kick off. Who knows what level they will be at. We're expecting another press conference tomorrow from Japan's top medical adviser. What's he expected to say? Is he going to agree with the government on the lifting of restrictions? Yeah, I mean it's it's difficult, but behind the scenes we know. That the government and its scientific advisers have had some differences of opinion. I mean, these are not scientists who are going to step seriously out of line, but they have stood up and challenged the government on on some things in the past. And and I know from having conversations with them myself, that members of that advisory panel, some of them, are unhappy with the way the government handled it. They don't think their communication has been clear enough, and they think that they should be threshold set. For when the situation will be judged safe or not, the government gives the impression of not wanting to lay down those metrics, because at that might be caught in a position where it's forced or under even greater pressure to call off these gains, which it really doesn't want to want to do. So I think tomorrow the scientific advisor Mr Romney will will will, probably, you know, caution that this these games are not without risks and he will probably encourage people not to. Try and watch them in person. He'll want the numbers to be low, but I expect that he will not contradict this policy that has emerged in leaks in the last few days which you mentioned the government saying they want a cap of 10,000 on stadia but no less than that. Richard, the Prime Minister said right at the beginning he wants to avoid a rebound. He wants to avoid the hospital system collapsing. How bad is the pandemic been in Japan? Well, Japan is now in its sort of 4th wave, the 4th spike on the graph compared to the countries of Western Europe and North America. Japan's actually had a pretty good pandemic until early this year. At the end of last year the numbers were very low compared to almost every other big industrialized country. Now they're in a situation where that that's changing for two reasons. One, they've got this 4th wave and and new variants coming and spreading more quickly, but also vaccination rates are. Terribly low in Japan compared to almost every other comparably rich and advanced country. As you said, little over 6% of people have had both jobs. Now it's going to be a bit high when the Olympics come around, but but not that much. So that's the context all right Richard? Great to get your thoughts. Will let you get back to that. Press conference still taking place the Prime Minister now talking about relationships with China though, so he has moved on, but good to have you with us, thanks."

Mark","The Gospel of Thomas is probably the most famous non canonical gospel. Everyone seems to know a little bit about it. They'll ask questions like why is the Gospel of Thomas not in the New Testament, or did you know the Gospel of Thomas might be an independent source to the sayings of Jesus? But what does the Gospel of Thomas really say? And why isn't it in the Bible? The Gospel of Thomas is preserved in its entirety in a single Coptic text from the non commodity library. A horde of early Christian texts discovered in the mid 20th century. It appears in a few Greek fragments to the Coptic manuscript dates to the 4th century CE, but it's probably a copy of an earlier Greek version that dates to the 2nd century, but some scholars have even posited a late 1st century date, dating Thomas is actually really difficult because, unlike the canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the Gospel of Thomas. Is a sayings gospel. It's comprised of 114 sayings of Jesus, no narratives, no sermons, just short sayings. So presumably editors could have added to the text throughout its composition. In fact, one scholar, April Deconick, argues that the Gospel of Thomas underwent several layers of composition, starting as a kernel of Aramaic Jesus sayings in the mid 1st century, all the way through to the 2nd century, with the version that we have today, though not all scholars agree with Doctor Deconnick to make things simple and to avoid this debate, let's just say that the Gospel of Thomas. Probably was composed in Greek and dates probably between 1:35 CE and 200C E, though with the added possibility that some sayings might date all the way back to the historical Jesus and some of them might have been an Aramaic. Now a lot of people think of the Gospel of Thomas as a gnostic gospel in an earlier video. I say why this assumption is a lot more complex than what you think the Gospel of Thomas actually lacks. A lot of gnostic features. There is no mention of a evil demiurge. There's no mention of eons or archons like what we see in the Gospel of Judas. We just have a few sayings that sound as it. Eric and the fact that the gospel was packaged with other gnostic gospels like the apocryphon of John in actuality, a large portion of the Gospel of Thomas has parallels to the New Testament Gospels. However, these parallels are always a little bit different, which leads some scholars to believe that the Gospel of Thomas is an independent source to the sayings of Jesus. For example, Thomas Verse 96 has close parallels to Matthew 1333. Jesus said the Kingdom of the father is like a certain woman. She took a little leaven concealed it in some dough and made it into large loaves. Matthew, on the other hand, reads he said to them another parable, the Kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened. So we obviously have parallel texts here, but there are enough differences between these two texts that make scholars think they are independent texts. Maybe one of them more original than the other, but who's to say which one is more original? This question is actually really difficult to answer. Some scholars think that Thomas often contains the older version of these Jesus sayings because they're more simplistic. In the canonical gospels, which often have very embellished parables, a good counter argument comes from Simon Gathercole in his huge commentary on the Gospel of Thomas. He argues that the Gospel of Thomas is non independent of the canonical gospels, and in fact whoever compiled Thomas was probably aware of the synoptic Gospels in Thomas Verses 1314 and 44. There seems to be some influence on the Gospel of Matthew and in Thomas versus 3365 and 104 there seems to be influence from the Gospel of Luke. Furthermore, he argues, since the Gospel of Thomas dates to the 2nd century. And is far removed from Jesus life. And since the Gospel of Thomas lacks specific details about 1st century Palestine, he concludes that it doesn't tell us much at all about the historical Jesus. As scholarship currently stands and with the primary sources that are available to us at the present, the Gospel of Thomas can hardly be regarded as useful in the reconstruction of a historical picture of Jesus. So at this point in the debate, we should just admit, yeah, some of the sayings are very ancient and some of them might date back to the historical Jesus himself. But the nature of our sources just don't let us know for sure. And very smart people are on both sides of the debate. So finally, let's tackle this question of why the Gospel of Thomas is not in the New Testament. Some people would say, well, since there is so much overlap between the synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of Thomas, why is it not in the fold? It seems to belong there now. The canonization of the New Testament is extremely complex, but there are a few factors that we consider to help answer this question. First of all, there seems to have been a lot of resistance to have anymore Gospels than just four. We have evidence that the four Gospels circulated as a collection. Very early on, even before the broader Canon started to develop. For example, papyrus 45 of the Chester Beatty Papyri contains the four Gospels in the book of Acts dating to about the 3rd century CE. So even while the Gospel of Thomas started to circulate, the four Gospel exclusive fan club was already starting to solidify. Moreover, there seems to have been a lot of resistance to gospels of Thomas and General Church authorities such as Hippolytus, Origin, Eusebius, cereal. Did I miss the blind, Jerome and Ambrose? All of these guys mention a gospel of Thomas, and all of them say that they're forgeries made by heretics origins quote is particularly striking. Also in circulation is the gospel according to Thomas. These come from those who set their hands to it, but the Church of God approves for a loan. Now we can't be for sure if these guys are talking about the Gospel of Thomas that we have today. After all, there were several books called Thomas. We have the infancy Gospel of Thomas and we have the book of Thomas the contender. But this is evidence that there was significant. Push back against any gospel named Thomas. So these are two factors to consider. If anyone asks why the Gospel of Thomas is not in the Bible, the four gospel tradition was very early and very popular and a lot of church authorities just rejected any gospel of Thomas. But we should also consider that in many respects the canonization of the New Testament was an organic process. It wasn't all top down decrees from church authorities. Certain books gained huge popular followings and circulated more widely. Matthew, for example, is known to be one of the more popular gospels of early Christianity. We found the remnants of about a dozen manuscripts of Matthew that date to the 2nd and 3rd century and 16 of the Gospel of John, but only one Thomas manuscript, and even then this manuscript is from the 4th century. It appears Thomas was just not as popular as other gospels like Matthew and therefore did not circulate as widely. Overall, the Gospel of Thomas is one of the greatest finds from the 20th century and has greatly contributed to our understanding of early Christian textual practices in early Christianity in general. At this point, though, I would say go read it for yourself. It's not that long and you might learn something new. As always, thanks for watching and subscribing and I'll see you next time now. This video is the latest in my series varieties of early Christianity where I try to approach early Christianity from a different perspective, not heretics versus Orthodox Christians, but rather looking at Christianity as a complex web of competing and sometimes overlapping Christian communities. We've talked about topics like Marcion and the Gospel of Judas, but if you have any suggestions yourself, feel free to leave them in the comments below and I'll add them to the queue and also special shout out to our patrons on Patreon.

#TheFWord #GordonRamsay","Right, the most amazing fish and chips which is my go to comfort food served with incredible fries and the most delicious mushy peas. For me, fish and chips screens card highly sustainable, delicious. But the secret is in the batter. This is a beer batter. 00 flour eggs and beer. It sort of makes it lighter crispier and it's an amazing flavor. The secret is to make that batter the night before. The more you can let it rest, it becomes so crispy. Take your card, run it through into seasoned flour, salt, pepper. You could jazz this up a little bit with a touch of paprika. Lightly season your fish. 2 water fish can destroy the batter so I like to season my fish. First, with salt that extracts the moisture from the fish, which keeps the batter even more crispy. Then from there just brush off that seasoning and just pads down the fish. That way it stays nice and firm into the flower and then nicely rolled. Make sure we get the ends done. Dredge the fish in the flower in order to make sure the batter sticks really important, and then next into the batter. Make sure you dust off any excess flour, otherwise you get these white clumps of flour underneath the batter into the batter. Then it's sink. I like topping tailing my fish like. Trim the top, trim the base. We've got the even piece of fish. If it's cut evenly, it's gonna cook evenly. Shake off the excess flour and into the batter. Roll that fish round and let it sink in there. Now oil comes up to 300. It takes about 6 to 7 minutes to cook beautifully. But here's the secret. Keep that fish coated. This is where it gets messy, but exciting. Lift up your fish, go left to right, dredging it and then very quickly get a point on the fish. Let the batter rundown shake off any excess flour. And then into the fryer and justice sort of taunt it first, and justice let it lay away from you. Shake the pan gently. That starts to cover the top of the fish. Take a spatula and just gently based the top of the fish. Once you've had the fish in there for two minutes, flip over the fish and that way you see it evenly coated because it's beautiful golden brown. Now take that out, shake it well, let that sit there like these perfect parcels, and literally, that's it there. Now, as it's piping hot. Get your salt and just lightly season the top and what happens to the fish now it just gets even crispier, but the batter seasoned underneath and on top. That's really important, right? Fries? These are Yukon gold potatoes and basically just peeled, not wash 'cause I want the start to get really nice and crispy. I start them off at a very low temperature in a way that I glanced them and that is literally in the oil first for two minutes at 3:30 in. Planting basically means cooking with no color and the secret here now is the blanche for two minutes at 3:30. Take them out, let them rest, crank up the heat, go from 320 to 385. Great now temperatures risen fries back in second time cooking and this time it's getting really nice and crispy. A great indicator cooking in fryers is that when it starts to float a confirmation that it's cold, whether it's fish, chicken or fries. Cooking fries twice. Blanching them first and then put them back in hot oil at the end. There's so much more healthier because they don't. Set in the oil anywhere near as long as frozen fries so it's really good to cook them twice. Super healthy fries are gonna shake. I can hear how crisp they are out onto a tray, drain them really well, lightly rub off the excess fat, let them sit there. I love placing them into a bowl. Fresh parsley on top, a touch of paprika and then touch of salt and pepper and then from there just roll them around here how crispy they are. Beautiful fish and chips have not been complete unless we got peas. I use frozen peas all the time so don't be scared. A splash of oil, just a splash peas go in. She is such a salt, such a pepper, a little hint of shallots, minced in and garlic. Great way of elevating mushy peas from their little knob of butter in. And then you just toss those peas. Once that bus is evaporated, we turn off the gas and then just crush. It's beautiful and that's why you take this frozen pea into a mushy pea and we sort of trying to break it up almost like a sort of like a puree, but I don't want to refine them too much because the flavor is when you burst them, touch more butter in there. Butter gives it a really nice glossy finish. One more little finishing touch. Fresh mint. Just bring your legs down, lay them on top of one another, get your largest leaf on the bottom, roll it really tight and then just shred. Let the knife do the work. Look useful fresh mint. Eagle that over your peas and that just lifts the peas beautifully. When I serve lemon on a plate, I take these bits off. Is it like the posh parts? It's just like the perfect wedge or slice of lemon and now we're ready to plate fish comes over. Yeah, how crunchy that is Fry's makes you know crispy. There beautifully done and then from there this beautiful mound of mushy peas place to the side. Finally the sort of Rolls Royce of sources with fish and chips, tartar sauces and mayonnaise with gherkins, onions and the most amazing capers in there that goes on the side and that just cascades off. And how can you serve fish and chips without lemon? I get my lemon here and I just squeeze it. Over the fish onto the salt and then kind of fresh one there literally for seconds. And there we have fish and chips. Alan Gordon."

The survey, which is the flagship under document reviving the state of economy, has projected India's GDP growth between 8 to 8.5% in the financial year 2023. While the current year's GDP growth has been projected at 9.2%, among other projections, the services India has fiscal space to wamp up capital expenditure. While challenges remain for the economy. On macro economy, front well for more on this we are joined by wins, business editor. Submit chaturvedi. Thank you very much. Summit for joining us. The Economic Survey for 2021-2022 is expected to give a growth projection of around 9% for the next financial year as Asia third largest economy is showing no signs of recovery from the pandemic. What does that mean for India? Eric. Well, India is currently looking at 3rd wave of COVID-19. Though this wave has not been as damaging as. Other things, but yes, this is one of the biggest challenges Indian economy would face going forward. So as per the economic survey which is the flagship and will document of Government of India that reviews the economic performance and forecast the challenges. It says that Indian economy is very poised to meet any challenges. There is a growth which is happening on Duval side agricultural side in this side and exports are also robust. But there's some challenges that remain and the first of the biggest challenge. One of the biggest challenges is definitely crude. This note is projected is projecting crude between 70 to $75 to a barrel as we speak today. It has reached $90.00 to a barrel. Also, this is maintaining the growth based on monsoon normal monsoon and there will be no further waves or damaging waves of COVID-19. So it's a kind of overall performance of economy which has been given in this economic survey. Today 9% growth over 9% growth. While that's nine point, 2% growth for this current financial year. But it may come down between 8 to 8.5% for the next financial year. So overall that growth has been projected that it challenges have been given. What are the other steps that are needed to be taken? That's also been given and also it's coming a day before the general budget going to be presented by C Chairman, Finance Minister of India tomorrow. It's in a way showing where the economy is going, what steps are needed to be taken and what could be the problem if these steps are not taken while the Minister say it's supply side. Informs complex and exports to be growth drivers for next financial year. Agriculture in the financial year 2022. So a growth of 3.9% and industrial growth was at 11.8%. What other sectors will be India focusing on this financial year? One of the main drivers of growth could be the export sector. Well this is something which clearly India is aiming to go for over the last few years India has started some flagship programs like make in India. Production linked incentive scheme. This is to make India though the overall factory of the world. It has been taken into account that India will be increasing its exports over the next few years. For that steps have been taken. So one of the main growth drivers would be exposed, but that will depend a lot on how the Jubilee tickets politics play over the next few months. Also where the crude goes. Also what are what is the COVID-19 situation but one of the main road drivers are going to be explored. India has taken a number of steps over the last few months when we saw. Chip shortages and there's trying to be a crucial contributor to chip manufacturing in the world. Also supply chain challenges so, so all these have been detailed in this economic survey today. Finally, submit the Union budget like you mentioned, will be presented tomorrow the 1st of February. What can we look out for? Well spoken to a range of policymakers and we're also Indian corporates. They all are of the view that Indian Finance Minister should push the pedal because the economy it needs growth. Well after seeing after witnessing well over the last few quarters the growth has been coming down not just in India but across the world so that the demand size has to be given some kind of. Overall, push for that to take it into account investment, new projects, they have to come over all. There has to be supply side problems. They have to be taken into account as well, but demand side growth is required so investments will be required in the areas of health, health care, agriculture. Infrastructure is a big area as well. Defenseman defense. Well, that has been given a good share over the last few budgets, but this time it's expected to get good cheer as well. Health care is 1 sector and for common man it's always a point of. Interest is what is going to happen in the. The text bracket. Will there be change in tax bracket or not? Well that is something which will be looked out for in the coming budget tomorrow. We own business editor submit.

#JudgmentDay #Terminator","Hey Ernie, we're here to see your gym in fridge. What do you want? Alright, Arnold, we're here to see your fridge you ready. Let's do it. What is it exactly that you want to see in the fridge? You just want to see the food? Or do you want to bust me because I'm not 100% vegan? What is it that you have to follow me? So anyway, this is the refrigerator in my office. We have here fruits with vegetables. We have one of my favorite things that when it gets hot, I have watermelons cut up watermelons. We have, of course the rattler which is a German drink, a combination of lemonade and beer and love it. Most people don't know this, but it's been secret protein drink. Don't tell anyone. OK, this is between us. OK, so here we go with the protein you wanted to see how a protein is made. It's nothing special about it. I just put in a little bit of this almond milk. Not much, just a little bit. And those are for muscle soreness, and sometimes bone soreness. Put a little bit of that in there. Then you go and you put the banana in. I don't do it always with clean hands. When I touch every dumbbell and barbell machine that other people have already touched, but it's just a good immune system, going into really always be able to fight back. Now there's an acre Oleg that we put in there for actually, I like to put in the whole egg. Now this drink. Literally, you could serve. At any bar, health bar or any other bar, I sometimes put in their schnapps, I sometimes put in there the killer. So it just gives you the extra flavor. What does your diet look like these days? Unless you can see I'm health conscious. I wasn't always health conscious because when it was young you know you get away with a lot of things for a little bit from that and now eat more. You know, like oatmeals and greens and vegetables and healthy foods. Stay away more from the meats and more from animal products. Animal proteins, because there was this misconception. It's the only way you get big and strong. So now I've backed off that and I feel much better at being one. Greens, you cook it all. Yeah, of course. My favorite thing to cook is of course take a lot of times. My bodybuilding friends come over to my kitchen or come over here. To this office and they won't, of course, eat the delicious food because they all want to look like me. It's never gonna happen. I love that anyway. What kind of snacks do you eat? I've, you know, during the day I have a make a little protein drink, of course, because I think this is the best, you know. We have the ladder proteins, then mix it with some of the the milk here and sometimes chooses. And then some of them have energy drinks also, and so it really depends what kind of a mood that I'm in and if I'm tired or not because our energy drink is really great when you're tired. Do you drink cows milk? I would say that I hate cows milk. I think almond milk this is much better. What other foods do you hate? I don't really hate much of anything, I just stay away from it because of health reasons. But I mean, I'm I always was called the garbage disposal because I was never sick and tired of anything. I mean anything. Is a method that would go to restaurants and I would say to people make me an omelet and they said, what do you want to be in the omelet? And they said anything that's in the kitchen sink or anything that you can find on the kitchen floor. Just scrape it up and put it in there and I would love it. And that's exactly what they did. Have you ever tried a fad diet like keto or intermittent fasting? And I saw the film, I don't have time for fat tires or anything like that. I have to go and go into real serious kind of a regimen. I broke out harder and do more cardiovascular training. And I watched much more with AIDS. I cut out just simply all the sugar products and I cut out all the white bread. Do you take any supplements? Yeah, big supplements that they go multivitamins and they you know everything that the body needs. And but like I said called supplements. The supplement of what you eat. So the key thing is it's not to rely on a supplement as much as you rely on good food. Natural food, lot of greens, lot of fruits and a lot of really good proteins. Does Arnold ever have a cheat day cheat? Days come up? Quite frequently I just remembered that even three days before the Mr. Olympia competition in 1970, after training, he will go to the House of Pies. So the key thing is always to remember that for every calorie you take in, you got to burn it off. There's no one else is going to do it for you. You got to do it. How often do you workout? I workout everyday, I work out in the morning of around 7:00 to 7:45 and then I ride the bicycle every morning when I'm 45 minutes and then many times they go back at night. It'll workout at home in my home gym. What do you consider an intense workout? Well, what I'm doing right now is not what I consider an intense workout. This is kind of like Mickey Mouse workout because we're doing the filming right now, so it just goes through the motions. But I'm not really training that heavy anymore. Because. After my heart surgery. Was advised not between heavy and not to do any work going for three reps and the heaviest weight in order stuff, so I do more kind of lighter weights and more reps. Do you still chase the pump? The pump is always out there and we always have to chase after it. Yes, it's the best thing for your career when you become a world champion in bodybuilding and you. Reach your goal like I did after winning 13 World Championship titles in the seven times. Mr. Olympia five times. Mr universe. Mr International. All this kind of competitions. Then it is important to inspire others. Because I recognize that I did not go where I am today, I did not reach this point in bodybuilding when anything else without inspiration of so many people. If it is in bodybuilding, rich Park or Steve briefs, you know, and in public service Ronald Reagan or Mother Teresa Mohammed Ali, there was one of the most generous, most giving person that inspired me to give something back to the community. There's always people inspired me, so to me. It's important to hang on the wall and do you have other people look up there and say so look what this guy has accomplished. He came over here from Austria with absolutely nothing and he became the world champion in bodybuilding and he became the highest paid movie actor in the leading man. And then he got into politics whatever his dream was, he accomplished because of hard work and because of a lot of help. And so I'm I want to be an inspiration to so many others. All right now, it's time for our rapid fire questions. 7:00 AM workout. 7 PM 7:00 AM usually squat deadly when you say squat or deadlift is the same thing as saying drinking or eating. I mean, I think we need both right? So therefore it's a crazy question we should try to workout the whole body in minimum of three times a week. CrossFit yay or nay. I think it's good done the right way. Dumbbells, a kettlebell. It makes no difference because the muscle doesn't see where you're holding in your hands. Running on a treadmill or in the great outdoors. Both biggest compliment Jack rips wool or cut. If you could work out with. Anyone in the world dead or alive, who would it be? I would like to workout with Eugene Sandow. With one of my idols it was the first bodybuilder that also was a small man. I think that he's a remarkable human being as a remarkable athlete and strong man. You know, a lot of celebrities on gym and fridge say you're their ultimate workout partner. What do you say to that I'm here Gold's Gym every morning. If you want to workout coming down and we have a good time. Alright. Listen guys, I gotta get back to my room. OK, time for fooling around is over so. Exit and don't say I'll be back OK."

A handful of species on Earth share a seemingly mysterious trait: a menstrual cycle. We’re one of the select few mammals on Earth that menstruate, and we also do it more than any other animal, even though it’s a waste of nutrients, and can be a physical inconvenience. So where’s the sense in this uncommon biological process? TED-Ed describes the history and evolution of menstruation. 

Lesson by TED-Ed, animation by TED-Ed.","A handful of species on Earth, they share a seemingly mysterious trait, a menstrual cycle. We're one of the select few monkeys, apes, bats, humans and possibly elephant shrews are the only mammals on earth that menstruate. We also do it more than any other animal, even though it's a waste of nutrients and can be a physical inconvenience. So where's the sense in this uncommon biological process? The answer begins with pregnancy. During this process the body's resources are cleverly used to shape a suitable environment for a fetus, creating an internal haven for a mother to nurture her growing child. In this respect, pregnancy is awe inspiring, but that's only half the story. The other half reveals that pregnancy places a mother and her child at odds. As for all living creatures, the human body evolved to promote the spread of its genes for the mother, that means she should try to provide equally for all her offspring. But a mother and her fetus don't share exactly the same genes the fetus inherits genes from its father as well, and those genes can promote their own survival by extracting more than their fair share of resources from the mother. This evolutionary conflict of interests places a woman and her unborn child in a biological tug of war that plays out inside the womb. One factor contributing to this internal tussle is the placenta. The fetal organ that connects to the mother's blood supply and nourishes the fetus while it grows. In most mammals, the placenta is confined behind a barrier of maternal cells. This barrier lets the mother control the supply of nutrients to the fetus, but in humans and a few other species, the placenta actually penetrates right into the mother circulatory system to directly access her bloodstream. Through its placenta, the fetus pumps the mothers arteries with hormones that keep them open to provide a permanent flow of nutrient rich blood. A fetus with such unrestricted access can manufacture hormones to increase the mother's blood, sugar, dilate her arteries, and inflate her blood pressure. Most mammal mothers can expel or reabsorb embryos if required, but in humans, once the fetus is connected to the blood supply, severing that connection can result in hemorrhage. If the fetus develops poorly or dies, the mother's health is endangered. As it grows, a fetus is ongoing. Need for resources can cause intense fatigue, high blood pressure and conditions like diabetes and preeclampsia. Because of these risks, pregnancy is always a huge and sometimes dangerous investment. So it makes sense that the body should screen embryos carefully to find out which ones are worth the challenge. This is where menstruation fits in. Pregnancy starts with a process called implantation, where the embryo embeds itself in the endometrium that lines the uterus. The endometrium evolved to make implantation difficult so that only the healthy embryos could survive. But in doing so, it also selected for the most vigorously invasive embryos, creating an evolutionary feedback loop. The embryo engages in a complex, exquisitely timed hormonal dialogue that transforms the endometrium to allow implantation. What happens when an embryo fails the test? It might still manage to attach or even get partly through the endometrium. As it slowly dies, it could leave its mother vulnerable to infection. And all the time it may be emitting hormonal signals that disrupt her tissues. The body avoids this problem by simply removing every possible risk each time. A violation doesn't result in a healthy pregnancy. The womb gets rid of its endometrial lining along with any unfertilized eggs, sick, dying, or dead embryos. That protective process is known as menstruation, leading to the period. This biological trait, bizarre as it may be, sets us on course for the continuation of the human race."

#Lucifer #DevilTraining #TomEllis","Hello, I'm Tom Ellis. I play Lucifer on the show Lucifer and I'm going to show you today. My training regime that I used to get into shape especially for season four of Lucifer hashtag devil training. Let's give it again. So before I do any lifting, I like to start by having a good 20 minute warm up on the treadmill so I'll do 5 minutes of an easy nice place jog and then I'll do intermittently 45 seconds of Sprint so I'll crank it up to about 12 miles an hour for a Sprint for 45 seconds and take it back down to a walking pace for about four miles an hour. And I'll do that until I get 20 minutes. And then I've got my blood pumping and I'm ready to go. When we were getting in shape Lucifer season four, I really wanted to gain some muscle mass and so the best way to do that was consult my trainer Palo Palo, everybody and basically Palace suggested that we did. Well, we're gonna train six days a week, but we do four days of it is at the upper lower body, split using big compound movements. Get the big muscles going so an upper body day will contain things like this, the bench press. So when we're doing the bench press, we're working to try and build that lean muscle mass. So I'll put a heavyweight on there. I'll do somewhere between 8 to 10 reps and we'll do that four times. So this is an oldie but a goodie. It's the classic wide grip pull up now. I can do any of these beginning of the year, but a lot of practice keep your core engaged. Get under it nicely and go for it. What you meant to breathe out on the way up? I'm slow back down as I say I couldn't do any of these beginning of the year, so I've slowly built up to doing probably about 10 reps on my first go and it will slowly come down to 8/6 and probably 6 again. I'll try and do four sets of those. Another great compound movement to get the shoulders fired that I'd like to do this at the start of my my upper body days is the overhead seated shoulder press. I'd like to try and start heavy, so I've got £40 on each arm parallel. He's so good if you have got a trainer and using heavy weights it's great to help you get into position without injuring yourself. So if we get them up with a swing 321. In position. And a nice. Get a good depth on them. And it's going to explode upwards. The slow contracting is just as important for the muscle building as doing it for the exercises quickly. Let's do one more, yeah. And then just to get them down safely, tuck them into your body. So if you really want to carve out those shoulders, a great Superset exercise to do with the overhead presses is single arm cable lateral raise. So get the cable. You don't have to overload. This way you're going for good, clean reps, so straight up down to the side. Down to the side you superset this, we go bed presses. We do four sets of each one with minimal rest in between. And his shoulders will bleed. OK, time to get the guns going. I'm going to use the classic single arm bicep curl, except we don't need heavy weights. People use heavy weights and often cheat by swinging their bodies. I'm going for a flat surface on my back. My flat against here. That's it, and then you want to get your elbows pinned in like this and you want nice slow contractions. Then bring them both up like that. Keep them together and just lower. Slowly one. That I'm nice. Long controlled movements. Why am I talking so slowly? So in terms of reps and sets, we're doing 10 reps on each arm, which if you work it out, there's 20 reps back and forth and you want slow steady movements and we do that four times. So one of the best exercises you can do on leg day is the classic squat. It fires up all the big muscles. You get a nice good heavyweight good form and come down and open up. Horses every. This is not really. I'm going to wait till today, but normally I'd stack it up with about 60 to 70 kilos. It's all about form and protecting your back. Oh my bum feels nice right? Well that's just a few exercises from the the devil training that I do with Paolo. Always have a good 10 to 15 minute stretch afterwards. I have to these days 'cause I'm getting old and I need a load of this stuff. Keep hydrated, eat clean and you'll see the difference. Ladies."

Marisa Tomei's Guide to Natural Skin Care & Everyday Makeup | Beauty Secrets | Vogue","Hi, I'm Marisa Tomei and I am going to show you what gets me through the day. We're just starting out in the morning I washed my face and I always have a lot of water with me. I have a shake in the morning. I take chlorella especially. If I ate something salty or sugary or hallux drink because Chlorella is really good for hangover and all kinds of toxins. This chlorella, there's a couple of times that I use, but this one is sun food. I always kept it really simple as I grew up, I was interested in meditation and in grounding myself and that kind of led to how do I take care of my body the best way. So I always kept it really simple. Also probably a bit lazy and probably a bit busy so I just do the minimum vitamin D ladies need to take a lot of vitamin D. It's cancer preventative. Good for your overall health. I was always dancing when I was young, so I always was very grateful to my body and wanted to take care of her. So that's probably that started that relationship and relying on my body when I met Lisa Bonet and we became really good friends. Probably when she was 16 and I was probably 17 and a half and she was really into this stuff too. So we always liked the house, the product and whatever was at the health food store. So we kind of went on that old journey together. My hair is real, I just want to put that out to the world because everyone asked me if it's extensions they're not. Let's get into skin care. My first step is this soap. It's cedar fellow. I stick to a routine, mostly because I can't have things with chemicals that they get very red and just like break out, they don't make my skin doesn't like it when I'm working and there's a lot more makeup put on to my face, which I don't. I don't like a lot of foundation and we try to keep that really light, but still I always go back to these these things. The hydration is the main thing. Intelligent nutrients. It's just a little. And then one spritz of this serum that goes with it. I never had that extra little step of that liquid green oil. I just always kept it simple. I'm just I've been washing my face with the sitafal forever, probably because I saw something in Vogue talking about C to fill at some point in my life. This I got at the Sundance Film Festival. There was a makeup artist who worked with me. He was from Europe and he had this home neoplasm mean that. It just keeps my lips super soft and moist. This is by Persephone and it's also made with all organic bio dynamic ingredients. That's that's the common thread with the things that go on to my body. This little gem is a recent addition. It's called mother. You can see me instead of goes fast and so it's it's Shea butter based and you just kind of emulsify it. While we're on limbs, I'm a big fan of Lord Jones. It's a CBD based kind of anti inflammatory, but what is really great for is when you're wearing heels at night or you're going to be standing for a long period of time putting some on your calves and your feet. You can stay in heels for. Forever and not and not feel any pain. There's a special one called Stiletto Cream. I would say the number one thing that I can't, I just can't leave the house that is my. To say no eyelash curler and I'm usually like 12345. Sometimes they use a little concealer. That's clay depo. Coming from Brooklyn, we used to put like tons of mascara on which I still really love this one. Is Lancome Mr. Big really like lays it on thick but when I was younger and laying on the mascara we used to use a safety pin to open up the lashes and that was also the punk rock days and the person who taught me to do all the way that I got in the habit of doing my tips like. This and then sometimes going on the top part of the lash to get like an extra coat in. Where's my junior high school friend, Ronnie Rosenberg. I do deal with my brows now differently. Been trying to grow them in for some time since they were super overplucked in the 90s. They were thin to begin with and as I get older I noticed that from here out they just kind of fade away. So I'm always trying to fill in. The outer parts. Of the brow with this Nars Christy striker has a very very super thin liquid pen that you can. Just barely start to. They're as fine as hairs. I put on a little bit of Charlotte Hillsbury. Blush I also Emma. Victim of overdoing it 'cause I always think I look too washed out. Put that a little bit there, and sometimes I stick it here and then at the end I take the hair down. Sometimes I put it back up, put it back up and down like three times. Also and I have a little thing for my for my greys, which is fine. You write all day just 66. I almost said 67. Guess I'm getting used to it 57. And that's it. It's pretty easy. Everyday, run around now I'm ready to start my day. Thanks for watching bye."

It's in a way showing where the economy is going, what steps are needed to be taken and what could be the problem if these steps are not taken while the Minister say it's supply side. Informs complex and exports to be growth drivers for next financial year. Agriculture in the financial year 2022. So a growth of 3.9% and industrial growth was at 11.8%. What other sectors will be India focusing on this financial year? One of the main drivers of growth could be the export sector. Well this is something which clearly India is aiming to go for over the last few years India has started some flagship programs like make in India. Production linked incentive scheme. This is to make India though the overall factory of the world. It has been taken into account that India will be increasing its exports over the next few years. For that steps have been taken. So one of the main growth drivers would be exposed, but that will depend a lot on how the Jubilee tickets politics play over the next few months. Also where the crude goes. Also what are what is the COVID-19 situation but one of the main road drivers are going to be explored. India has taken a number of steps over the last few months when we saw. Chip shortages and there's trying to be a crucial contributor to chip manufacturing in the world. Also supply chain challenges so, so all these have been detailed in this economic survey today. Finally, submit the Union budget like you mentioned, will be presented tomorrow the 1st of February. What can we look out for? Well spoken to a range of policymakers and we're also Indian corporates. They all are of the view that Indian Finance Minister should push the pedal because the economy it needs growth. Well after seeing after witnessing well over the last few quarters the growth has been coming down not just in India but across the world so that the demand size has to be given some kind of. Overall, push for that to take it into account investment, new projects, they have to come over all. There has to be supply side problems. They have to be taken into account as well, but demand side growth is required so investments will be required in the areas of health, health care, agriculture. Infrastructure is a big area as well. Defenseman defense. Well, that has been given a good share over the last few budgets, but this time it's expected to get good cheer as well. Health care is 1 sector and for common man it's always a point of. Interest is what is going to happen in the. The text bracket. Will there be change in tax bracket or not? Well that is something which will be looked out for in the coming budget tomorrow. We own business editor submit.

Is he sorted his came up to me pitched me this idea and it sounded ridiculous, but I just trusted him. Did he write it for you? He didn't write well, he didn't write it for me. I wish I wish he did. I mean now the idea of the premises. Seth and his wife have a little baby and they live in a suburban home and next door their neighbors move in and it's a frat. Now you're shirtless in a lot of the movie, yeah? Again, when I say I'm shirtless, I don't get that reaction now. See there you do. Yeah, I know I had to. I had to beg for it yeah yeah but I heard Seth was thinking take her shirt off for no reason. Yeah I know like constantly and I like idolize Seth this is like my hero yeah honor to work with him I would do anything in his command literally like he could. He would say just Zack shirt off at the scene and I'd be like OK. Yes Sir. Eventually I realized that like the cameras weren't really even pointed my direction. Like we're in a scene. We've already shot coverage for it, and I had my shirt on and like it's outside and he was just with me. You can say that on TV, sorry. Sorry. And make edits later. Sorry about that it it is an irreverent movie as well as charming, but it's great. And I gotta say the fight scene you and Seth have a crazy drag out fight scene and you also have a fight scene with Dave Franco too. Yes, did you break your hand? I did. Yeah, it's crazy. We did all our own stunts for this fight scene and I have a fight scene. How did you break in in that fight scene? Well, it was a standoff between basically he sleeps with my girlfriend. I saw the movie. Yeah yeah OK, but I saw the fight but you don't punch his face. No, I grab his balls really hard and he grabs mine. We sort of have. We're gonna cut this interview down in like 2 seconds. That's how you broke your hand. Whatever we have a standoff and yeah, so I don't know what it is. Man something happened those Franco brothers just have balls of steel. Alright, very good let's just stop it right there, but I did legitimately break my hands and yeah, it's understand. Yeah there's one you, you and Seth are the giant fight this gosh everything is so funny in this movie that little tiny jokes. But there's one thing we're Seth throws Christmas lights and like wraps it on your leg and Yanks you back in the room. Yeah, and that was your fighting you go. You're fighting him. You go. How did you do that? And you know, I don't know, you know why? Because that actually happened. Like he literally, he flung and I went how the excuse me? Apologize, I'm sorry.

Full Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/making-butter-chicken-faster-than-a-restaurant-but-faster","Today we're making the fastest butter chicken, let's begin. But faster this series, where we find a way to make your favorite foods as fast as we possibly can. Today, we're making butter chicken, someone's gonna order it going, get it and I'm gonna make it before they get back start your engines, place your orders and let's make this shall we butter chicken recipe on the website. We should probably be counting the time that it takes for them to order. 'cause technically that takes time to look. I'm right, washing my race so there's no race in there. You always make time for washing your rice water. In I used to pressure cooker on the last episode, which taught me a lesson. This is the one way to make rice really fast. OK manual, put it for three minutes. I've never had butter chicken, not one time to be honest. I just found out what it looks like. I think I would like it. OK, we're gonna cut our chicken to bite sized pieces. What does that mean? Are you able to bite? It does not. That's not a good reason. So single stroke slices make this a lot faster, but you gotta have a sharp knife so in here. Kashmiri chilli turmeric the recipes on the website that was cumin that's Gary Masala salt. And finally we're gonna add some ginger taking too much time. This weekend take time for. Normally you'd let this marinate, but do you think we have time for that? We can kind of find out what happens when we skip some of these standardized processes, 'cause I normally marinate this, so I'm curious how this will affect the recipe. Should I drive faster if it's bus faster in yeah? On y'all we're gonna cut our onion. Onions are done. Oh look, the sons here. OK garlic, good old fashioned slice that just done. You need a pan but a deep one makes sense. OK? Turn it up. Always use G whenever you're making butter chicken please. I think I should give me a flash costume and go go pick up the food in flash costume like this. Oh my God. OK problem solved. Just waiting for this to melt. Oh wow, this guy smells great. I've said this several times on this channel having everything near you right. I've got my tools behind me down here. Having that stuff near you having all your pots pans associated with your movements at is the key to your speed. OK, we're coming up to temp. We can have a little jazz moment. Yeah, why is my character wins again? I'm going to switch the car mode to the sports mode. We're on ECON mode right now. Saving gas. We're starting to smoke here. I'm gonna add my cheeky on oh I see the problem. This induction is only heating the center of it and not the outside of it, so that's good. That'll be really helpful for this. And by helpful I mean literally not at all helpful. So that victim, you like that wafting into my poles. I'm gonna overcrowd the pan right now because I'm in a hurry. Don't do this another waiting period. Like jazz moment. You know, I feel like we're losing right now. Could be the weather. Not feeling like a winner right now. We got some nice color going on here. We need a little bit of water area of effect here just to get her started. I'm flipping the chicken, yeah yeah yeah, I'm a little concerned with the fact that only the center was hot. It turns out just this circle heat stuff. I should have known that exit right here. It's crunch time. What can I use to press this? Walla, I don't wanna keep flipping it over and over and over 'cause we're gonna finish it in the simmer, right? So we're weighing it all down with this flat events here. Hopefully that works. Let's get the vibe. Check out this place just like a whole construction thing going on. It's a gas station where you can't pump gas. OK, that's enough steering for the day. I gotta get a move on on this. There's a lot of simmering involved with this recipe. So OW transfer is literally no color on that. Or I just don't don't look at it. I feel like every time I watch cooking shows and they say this year is something. This is usually what it looks like. So if you have a little bit more time, see it properly. Please onion and garlic in and then we're gonna season that unit with salt. So the Salt's really important in terms of speeding this up, because that is what's going to draw the water out of it if that a little saute that smells great. Wow, alright, these bad boys need to soften lid this real quick. Talk about this dude on those he's getting out. He getting in. So whenever you're waiting for stuff like this, you can do other things like you can start cleaning or just getting things out of the way right like clear your work station. I gotta check the order at the rice little chick. I could have Ruby go. Hey look at all that water. Never gonna add our spices. Got more garam masala, more Kashmiri chili, more turmeric, fenugreek powder, little bit of shuggy, wuggy and last but not least, a little bit of garlic that I forgot earlier. Whoops, they just picked up what, Oh my God, I'm OK. 20 minutes it's only been 10 minutes. Just crossed 20 minutes it did. It's been 20 minutes. Well then we're just gonna blend this right now. OK, I'm gonna need a blender. I hope this gets cooked all the way through. Alright, onions going in and with the tomato sauce. That looks pretty good actually. Heat back on, you know what? I'm not even gonna reduce it. I'm just gonna go ahead and add my cream. I can do this chicken. Just gonna I'm just gonna throw it all in right that's our only option right now. Maybe I was getting a little too cocky. Little bit of salt. What Josh Poppy mustard that together nicely. This is how I would never ever make butter chicken. Good Lord, it doesn't look terrible though, so the butter chicken is simmering. We're in a good spot right now 'cause we just need to simmer this for five minutes. Lid is going on that's hot 10 minutes. He got 10 minutes to wrap it up to oh 10. Oh oh, we got this. I didn't have to do all that. I think this shows two things. You can always take this sort of artisanal approach and take your time with it and like really, crank it out. Make it every element perfect. But as you just saw I threw everything together really quickly in a huff and it's still kind of working. And that goes to show that they're hard enough rules. Sweeten up your space. It's always this is go get this go get that. It's never what do you wanna make faster? I really don't have any concept of time I think that it's been like 5 minutes and it's been like 4 hours God I'm gonna die so soon I'm just gonna wake up and be like wow it's been a couple of years and like Josh you're 70. This doesn't look bad for skipping pretty much every single step. Not bad, it tastes awesome. And it seasoned perfectly. Chickens cooked. This is done. It's been 14 minutes and look. It's somehow thick and I don't know how that's possible. I think that there's a cooking got out there and I think it's watching over me right now. It's already done Kendrick's probably telling some funny joke that Kendrick got love Kendrick heat off last bit. We got some cold butter 2 tablespoons and stir that in. There's a piece of cilantro on my spoon that went in there. Sorry about it. Let it emulsify in. Gonna get nice and rich and creamy. Beautiful, we're done. Oh my God. Oh *** **** there 5 minutes out they could eat my butter chicken. Rice in make it look nice. You know we have the time. We've skipped every single rule I've ever had. I might have learned myself something here to launch throw you for butter chicken 25 to 28 minutes. To make this butter chicken on the fly as quickly as humanly possible. It looks right. I usually prefer the seal bit more velvety smooth. But you know, I'm not opposed to this, but the sun is going away 'cause the sun is like alright shows over, but not yet. We still have to wait for them Showtime. Doors lock again. No, it's time for the blind voting round. Go kick drink. Number one. So we got our best four to five except for one person, Ulysses. Even if it was 5050 'cause the other one was still good, we still made it delicious buttered chicken. But more importantly, it reached the heights you would desire in a butter chicken, simply faster."

Android: http://goo.gl/RQZUKR","Hey guys, sorry I didn't post a video last week. You follow my newly made Snapchat you know that I was in Hawaii for a wedding. And no, I'm not saying that just to plug my Snapchat. I hate it when people are constantly promoting their own snap snap snap. The real Ryan Higa. So yeah, I was in Hawaii for a wedding and why I'm so dark right now. So I apologize for not posting. And also I'm sick. But anyway today I'm gonna be talking to you guys about having to break bad news to people. It's literally one of the hardest things that you have to do in life, yet it's something that we all have to do. I honestly think it's harder to deliver bad news to someone than it is to actually receive it. And if you've been in that situation, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Breaking Bad news to people just sucks. It's one of the worst feelings ever, which is why I came up with this video to not just help you but myself as well. Here's some tips and techniques to make it a little easier on you guys the next time you have to break bad news to someone. Look first up, we got probably the most common technique that people use the good news and bad news technique. If you have to deliver bad news to people, you gotta give him some good news as well to cheer him up. There's no matter how bad the bad news is, there's always good news. You just have to find it. I got some good news and bad news when he first give me bad news. Well, you know how I just left to go get us lattes from Starbucks. So in the parking lot I kind of hit a kid. What are you serious? I mean, I fled the scene, but they definitely have your license plate on file and they're probably on the way here. Now. You kidding me right now, but they're still good news. How could there possibly be? Any good news? I got the lattes. Oh yeah, that's right. They spilled when I hit that kid. The figure. Now there's different levels of bad news. Obviously some are worse than others for this technique. All you have to do is give fake terrible news right before you give the actual bad news. So like comparison, the actual bad news is not that bad. Hey G, They're not making a frozen 2. That sucks, and also I kind of ran over your dog on the way here what. But wait before you get mad they are making a frozen 2. Your dog is still dead, though the cliche technique, one of the worst ways you can break bad news to someone, is by just surprising them. With this technique, you're going to give them a warning that bad news is coming so that they can mentally prepare for it. All you have to do is start your conversation off with a very cliche line such as yeah, there's a there's no easy way to say this, but. Indubitably, indubitably indubitably indubitably what does that work indubitably? Yeah, that it means, you know, to be without a doubt or or for sure I know what it means. But why are you trying to say it, oh, because your girlfriend is cheating on you? What Are you sure, indubitably, indubitably man there really is no easy way to say that word the good news, bad news, and even worse, news technique. Sometimes, when you have really, really bad news, you don't want to overwhelm the person. So you're gonna want to break it up into pieces. With this technique, you give it to them in part. So instead of giving them extremely awful news, you just give them bad news and. Even worse news like we mentioned earlier, it doesn't hurt to sprinkle a little good news in. There wasn't a sprinkle. I don't know what that was. So I have some good news, some bad news and some even worse news. Which idea first the good news? I guess the good news is that your son is still alive, so still alive. What happened? Well, that's the bad news. Do you want to know that now or I thought you wanted? Does it matter? Tell me what happened. OK, well, the bad news is your son has been hit by a car in a Starbucks parking lot. Why didn't you tell me that immediately you asked for the good news first. Not the bad saying he's still alive without even knowing isn't good news. You haven't even heard that even worse. How could it be worse? Well, the even worse news is that I lied about the good news. He's dead. It's not fun with it. Now, if you still can't figure out how to use these techniques, I made it even easier. I asked a bunch of you on Twitter for some of the worst news that you ever had to break. And judging by those tweets I came up with some of the most common situations that people find themselves in when they have to break. Bad news, here are some premade examples that you guys can use when you're in that situation, like when Grammas tests come in, you got your grandmother's test results back and, well, she passed. So she's going to be OK, but you just said she passed and she got. Aplus Way 8 Plus which passed away the worst news you could possibly break at a wedding and you Dana do you take Gregory to be your husband and by the power invested in me I now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride. Wait, I have something to say. I have terrible news. There's no easy way to say this so. The Wi-Fi is down. When she refuses to give Star Wars a chance. What are you doing? You know how I love Star Wars and I believe in the force. And ever since we've been married, I've been trying to get you to finally watch it. Still not going to right. Which is why I believe this belongs to you. What is that? What may divorce be with you when you get her to break the bad news for you can't just do the same move over and over and still win. Hey, you're cheating. I really am though. When is the highlight of his day? The park is closed today. When you're the boss, Sir, what are you doing? I'm gonna light this ring around you on fire, why? 'cause I'm firing you what? OK, obviously these are jokes. I took it a little too far. You're not gonna light someone on fire. This video actually started off kind of realistic and then I had too much fun with it. Sorry guys, but anyway, truth is there is no easy way to break bad news to some best way you can do it is by just getting straight to the point. Don't beat around the Bush. It's like ripping off a band it you just do it one time really fast and get it over with and you also hope that you're not hairy 'cause that hurts more. Look I have to get back to work in 10 minutes. What is it could be quick I promise. OK, well then what's up? So I have some bad news. Your newspaper you got wet outside, so it's pretty bad news now you scared pain first. Second, I thought it you really meant bad news. Well, to be honest I actually do have more bad news. From your neighbors lawns. I don't know if you want to give this to them or. To listen, there is something I need to tell you and it's pretty upsetting. It's setting. What is it? I just told you it's upsetting you, kind of slouching. You really should sit up 'cause you're back. It's not good for your back, you know. But anyway, the real reason why I called you out here is because, well, your parents. It's not looking good. My parents. What do you mean? It's not looking good? Your parents they they've definitely seen better days. What happened? It's just your parents is just a bit messy. Just tell me what happened. What is it? Your hair, my hair. What does this have to do with my parents? You talking about it? Your hair is everything to do with your appearance. I think it's your hair. It could also be your posture. You kind of slouching. Again, you went back to doing, wanted to tell you something up, sitting again, so you remembered to are you kidding me? Are you serious? I mean, that's two different answers. It's no. And yes, 'cause no, I'm not getting you. And yes, I am serious. You are still slouching. Is this supposed to be funny to you? Is this supposed to be a joke? Breaking Bad News is not supposed to be funny. Well, I know that it's under drama. Thriller what? Spence yeah, Breaking Bad. I know it's not a comedy, it's not supposed to be funny. It's a serious show and you do know that the show is over, right? So there's no new episodes so it wouldn't be under the new category. Where are you going? I'm going back to work. I'm so over this you made me worry for nothing you made it seem like you were going to give me bad news and you didn't. Technically I did give you bad news. Remember your neighbors bad news too. Goodbye, OK fine. Just just wait OK just I really do have something important to tell you. Where did God Ryan? If this is a. It's not, it's not OK. It really isn't. Look, I'm sorry I guess I just made all these jokes because I I just. I don't know how to break bad news to people and I just hate seeing people get upset. Especially people actually care about part of life. Ryan, everyone has to do it. I can take it. You just have to be honest with me and stop with the joking around. OK, well earlier in the video it wasn't a joke that lied. Something really happened to my parents. No no. Not that. Are you really cheating on me? No, of course not then. What is it? Well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is I already talked to your boss and he said you don't have to go back in today given the circumstances. That's the bad news. You know those bad newspapers from earlier? What about them? They weren't actually soggy from the rain outside, huh? He's firing you. So then goes again so much for watching if you want to see bloopers and behind the scenes please on the left if you want to see the previous video, click the one on the right and if not then you don't have to do anything. Just log onto your phone, go on to Snapchat and check out."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSBFXuPylHg,"The Indian factory making 6,000 syringes a minute - BBC News","One of the world's biggest syringe makers has ramped up production because of the huge demand for Covid vaccines. 

Rajiv Nath, who heads India's largest syringe factory, says it is now making around 6,000 syringes a minute.

But he says that's still not enough given that the world needs 10 billion syringes to vaccinate just 60% of the population.

He believes co-ordination between the vaccine makers, governments, the World Health Organization and syringe makers will be “very, very critical” going forward.

#Covid #Coronavirus #BBCNews","The building that you are in right now. This one produces around 4 billion searches every day. The pandemic has been a rollercoaster ride for us. Well, we've had to hire 500,000 people more, and we've had to rapidly train them, educate them, motivate them so that they do appreciate the great role that they are playing in, speeding up the production lines without compromising on quality. We do get about 30 to 40 emails every day from new clients wanting to reach out to us from USA, Germany, Italy, UK. But in most cases give to say sorry to them because for most of the product lines we have booked till September. You have to play a balancing game between India's need and the global leads. We've decided to keep 2/3 of our capacity for Government of India and 1/3 of our capacity for the global market. How fast we can do it is the fight that we're going to be having against COVID. I would say better coordination between the vaccine makers, the government, and WH as a coordinator and the singe makers is very, very critical and I find that piece is slightly missing. We could have done better over there. And we can do better over there. So we are the guns and the vaccines are the bullets and the faster the guns can be provided, the faster the bullets are available. Humanity can try to go back to its pre COVID times and the economies in these various countries can spring back towards pre COVID times as early as we can do it. Better follow."

I remember at the mosque I was at the mosque this happened a few years ago. A non Muslim man entered the mosque one time and he looked quite distraught. I still remember his face a panel while he was in between mid 30s to 40s. He looked quite affluent and he was very well spoken. He came up to me and said. Can I pray in your mosque your way? I said, well, do you believe in my way? Do you believe in your? Slim says no, I've never been taught anything, but I just want to pray your way because I'm in a lot of trouble. I don't want to talk about his problem, but he wanted to go to any God. Any God that is the truth. I'll presume that it we've gone to other places as well. Other places of worship, but he also came to the mosque searching for the true God to ask him to help him in his problem. You know, where did he came up to me and said I want to pray exactly as you pray you pray next to me. I'm going to copy you so he did exactly as my movements. And then after that he said, can you ask God in the way that you ask him to help me and save me and guide me and I said the words and he repeated it after me. The man hugged me. Now you know Ozzy in Australia are not used to just hugging strangers. But he hugged me. So the guy was quite distraught. He was so much in need and he had. It's as if he had lost all avenues. Didn't know which way to go so he turned. To God, it was instinctive, since he was born as a baby, he left, and I thought to myself, so Pamela. This is exactly in the verse of the Koran, where a last minute Alice is in chapter 31, verse verse 13. I lost my Dallas says. Do you not see that ships sail in the sea by a loss, grace that he may show you some of his signs? Surely there are signs in this for everyone who is steadfast and thankful. Then I lost a planet with the ellises when waves engulf them, so they're in the ship and then waves engulf them in the sea like canopy's like mountains like hills, they call upon a lot. Sacredly declare their faith solely to him, but when he delivers them to safety to land, some of them become lukewarm. You know, in different half hearted enthusiasm dies out, they forget. None denies our signs except the deceitful, the treacherous and the untrustworthy. See where they were before and how much they needed a lot. And then some people when they're safe from their calamity, how quick they return back to being ungrateful to align a lot calls and treacherous meaning. First, you call upon me sincerely, as it should be, and you connect yourself with me and I save you. And then you betray your own self. Subhanallah Ceelo did not say that he. He betrayed him, although doesn't need that he betrayed yourself and I lost my hair, always wanting you to straighten yourself up before you return to him. Yeah, yeah. Overwatch. Money. Yeah. You know? Dina oil morning."

You will be replicating a version of a crab dish prepared by one of the greatest chefs that I know, Gordon Ramsay. Tonight you're gonna have to use the crab meat that you extracted earlier and turn it into a faultless replication of my amazing crab Benedict. You all have to recreate this exact masterpiece. Now I'm going to show you how it's done. Fans cast iron pan, lightly buttered and get them in there so nice and toasted. Right holidays. First off, water up to a rolling boil. Pole in a goes in. Now we start whisking on the heat 15 seconds off the heat. Next step on a little teaspoon of your tarragon reduction in and keep whisking really important. Now slowly add your butter 123 stop. You can see the sauce starting to thicken up. Now we start to season salt. From there, a little touch of fresh lemon juice. Just squeeze that lemon in there and then pour that delicious rich holidays into your ramekin. Now poaching an egg. First of all, a touch of salt into the water and then a teaspoon of vinegar from their crack the egg and open it up into a cup. What we want to do now is create a bit of a vortex. Spin the water around, and then we drop the egg in there so it swells round gently. They should take on average 90 seconds to two minutes. Post that egg beautifully. Now, the crab salt and pepper. Drizzle of olive oil just a touch from their lemon zest so it's going to make it really nice and vibrant, and then squeeze your lemon juice in there. From there, your fresh chives. Roll that around. Don't overwork the crab. Now we're ready for legs, lift up and then gently place them on the towel bars is sitting there a light seasoning? Beautiful post eggs. Now our muffins beautifully toasted and then take your crab onto the bun. Now very carefully roll the egg into the spoon and sit it gently onto the crab. Now you take your holidays and you coat it almost like a nice brush of varnish. No drips. Again, take your time care for the pressure or the egg and then finally a light dusting of paprika. And that's how you make a delicious crab Benedict. But when we go in? That is what we're looking for."

I cut a ""square"" shape. Put the cabbage in a pot of hot water that is on low heat. While that is heating, prepare your meat mixture. MEATUse equal parts ground pork and ground beef. Add rice and salt. In a pan, saute the onions until they're translucent. Then add salt and Paprika. How much paprika? I'd say a few dashes. Then add the sauted onions to the meat mixture and mix ROLLTake the leaves out of the pot of water one at a time. Slice off the ""spine"" so it's easier to roll.Pack the meat into one end and roll it. Tuck in the ends  STACKStack the cabbage rolls ""snugly"" in the crock pot, directly on top of black forest ham. Add 1-2 bay leaves. Pour approx 1/3 jar of saerkraut on top. Pour your ceasar mix. It should cover the cabbage rolls. Cook for 4-6 hours as desired. Serve. I like to cool mine and eat them the next day. For some reason, these always taste better the following day once the flavours have marinated. Yep! You're welcome :)",

I know that people say is that you know India people are dying in the streets. That's ******** right? Because I'm living here and I've been here since January. That's my husband's Indian. And if you can see outside. Everyone, it's alright, so there are no people. No one. It's dying in the streets. I also would like to say that all these videos that you have seen about Delhi people dying in the streets. That's not true because Indians like to sleep in the street. You know like some that some parts of India. But you know, mostly mostly in the big cities you have people to take a nap. They sleep in the streets, especially poor people, and that's absolutely fine. But that doesn't mean that they're dying. That doesn't mean anything, it's just culturally. They're like that. OK, so whatever they show you about India is ********. It's not true at all. What we have in here is restrictions. So basically we're going through a strong lockdown that they only allowed. The shops are only allowed to open from 7:00 AM. Until 11:00 AM. Look this guys. Here's the guys. Do you see everyone, anyone die, anyone die you outside. Actually we waiting here to take some take away food because most of the places are shut. Today I had to buy some creams because I had to. I had to go back to UK right? And I was like let me buy something. You wear the Greens which I really love and what we did is we just call the guy. From the shop. Because he's in allowed to open the shop, he opened it for me on a black market literally. So I go inside the shop and then buy the things. So that's how Indian people are surviving towards these restrictions. What we have is restrictions. It's nothing like people dying. It's nothing like people are not taking care of anything. It's manipulation. You need to understand that they're manipulating you. Yeah, so unless you don't see it with your own eyes, don't ******* trust with the media saying."
https://www.bitchute.com/video/Zbjmylivs892/,Summer Catfish Makeup Tutorial // Samantha Lux,instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sxmxnthxlux/ ❤︎ SUBSCRIBE ❤︎ LIKE ❤︎ SHARE ❤︎,"You hi, what's up you guys? It's Samantha. Welcome back to my channel or welcome to my channel. If this is your first time here. My name is Samantha. I am a 20 year old female and this is my channel maybe I think getting a lot of comments asking me how I do my fake freckles. How I do my fund and highlight what highlight I'm wearing. Bunch of different questions on my summer routine so they thought I would make a video touching on all of the questions that I've gotten and pretty much just showing you how I do my everyday summer makeup and it's very. Easy, which is something that which is. Did not say he certainly did. So if you want to see how I got this makeup look, make sure that you keep on watching and I will see you at the end. Bye. OK, so let's get started. First thing I'm going to do like I always do in all the makeup videos I'm going to get my hair out of my way so you do have quite a bit of hair good. I hate when I hear back, but. Just going to put that side because that's the side that falls most of the time. The first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to prime my skin. Maybe I've been using just like an elf primer. It's the poorest face primer going to be putting this sides of my nose. My pores are big. I'm also going to put it like down there. I might have some texture some. The reason that I have no idea about first thing I'm going to do, which I don't usually do in my skin, is like not Oracle is put some concealer on before I put my foundation is going to be using the Knicks gotcha covered concealer. It's waterproof. It conceals literally anything we needed to and I'm just going to put that on with my finger just like right in the spots that I need a bit of extra inside is on. I'm going to be taking a little bit of translucent counter and just setting it. Tiny, tiny bit just so that it doesn't move anywhere. When I put my actual foundation on joking Foundation that has been using which is the Milani conceal and Perfect Foundation is just a little bit too dark for me even in the light of shade I have it in no one, and it's still a little bit too dark, so I'm going to mixing it with the mat and for the mat and for this. Went to mixing it with the Maybelline fit me matte and Poreless Foundation in the Shade 112, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to mix it around on the back of my hand with my beauty blender or my knockoff beauty blender if you want to get technical and then I'm just going to start blending in on my things. That looks like a lot. Don't worry, I'm gonna take this all over so it's not so. So I still haven't even picked up more foundation yet. I'm just blending around what I already had on my sponge, so don't want to be too thick. Obviously we're going for a natural Dewey summer look, so we're not. So we're not going to take it on too heavy today, too heavy. I say it's like layer foundation. Maybe that's where my hair back really fast, at least until I powder my face. My armpits very. Let's hope not. You know that is on. I'm going to be going in with my hardship, you concealer because you know you really want a very lightweight thin coverage. Sheer concealer. Going to have underneath my eyes and any other places that I'm afraid, might crease forming around and you throw the day. A lot of people like to bake just the size of the nose, but I literally can go everywhere because if I don't my. So it's like watching this fly like that close to me. If I don't set my nose like this, it will come off, especially when I get my nose contour and grow up the day and stuff. It will break up, it'll bunch together. It's just not a cute look. I'm going to go in with just this big fluffy brush and just kind of go over anywhere that I may have missed. It looks like my face is darker to knock it from this before I move on to my eyebrows, I like to just spray a little bit of a fixing this or I. Taking cucumber spray because I use a lot of powder as a good touch and I wanted to really sink into my face so I like to let it start again as I start my other makeup and I start my eyebrows. I like to brush them out first and lay them down into place. And then once they're brushed out, I go ahead and I take my Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow. I mean, I knew it was looking for the color and the color dark brown. I'm going to start shipping on my iPod. My start kind of like right down here in the middle. I just start outlining that bottom line. Bring softer and softer towards the inside and I'll take a little bit more. I'll go in and I'll realize if I also like to take my eyebrow and a little bit so I don't make it look at this a little bit more growth in the middle because I feel like it makes my nose a little bit slimmer. All about that catfish life, you know, take my hair down, don't look so ugly, but now that my eyebrows are done or filled in, I'm going to go ahead and take my tart shape tape and ship concealer. I'm going to go back into my tart shape tape concealer and I'm going to clean up my headphones. OK, so before I go on and do my eyeshadow I am going to go ahead and take my lashes that I'm going to be wearing and put glue on them and let them start to dry while I do. I got a tattoo. You guys looked a little female symbol. Oh my God, you see that ****. Scary, so here's the habit. I put my lashes down to dry and then I went to go to my eyeshadow and my camera died. So I'm not exactly sure where it ended, but. Basically what I did was I put eyeshadow primer of my eyelids. I dried it. I said I tried it. I set it with a translucent powder and then I just ran a neutral to warm brown through my crease and I just slapped the lash on like that's literally all I did. Super easy, super quick, super flirty. That's it. And today I'm going to be using my position Formula Bronze Booster product and I'm going to start contouring and I'm going to place it right on if not slightly above the bottom of my cheap phone. I'm going to blend. Right here on my forehead. Anything, just the control color, not leave the Brandy color and put it right. Here comes the fun part, and we're taking the contour color again on this small like eyeshadow brush and I'm going to be going. Right under the tip of my nose and then alongside. Everyone's been taking my wet and wild illuminating palette. I've been using this for so long. It's so beat up. It's kind of gross. It's I'm going to be using the. I think in the gold shade right over here I like to just swirl them together and kind of use it and use it as a blush. I'm going to be going in with my Jeffrey Star ice cold highlighter. Of course, I'm just going to kind of, you know, pushing a little bit on by little things like. Just a little bit in between my eyeballs. Stop making noise. Next I'm going to be doing my lips today. I'm going to be using the mix galadon slide on glide on, stay on and defining minor color. I don't like it all. Looks like this, it's waterproof. That's usually all I do for my lip color. I like to be very natural when it's like. For summer, but we're going to be adding a little bit of a gloss today. It's the very, very last step. Big buckles. You have to have big hearts, especially in the summer, like there's something you can. I like to look at the freckles on my nose and then also a little bit on the phone near my highlight. And I just cleaned them out. Give myself one more spray. It is dry off with this. Casualty. Set aside for the make up for today so let me go ahead and. Throw in my earrings. We're done ready to go. So that is going to be for this week video. You guys enjoyed it. Learn something. We have to hope you don't hate trans people now. Literally like too much. So right now we have always gives me like go."

Business owner Jung Kim said that she was punched in the face by a customer who hurled racial insults at her as she was pummeled. “You little Asian girl,” said Sung Jun Lee, the woman’s son. “That’s what she remembered.” The attack left Kim bloodied and bruised with a broken nose. Kim said the break is so bad that she needs surgery. The trouble started after Kim said she asked Keaundra Young, Daquiesha Williams and three other women to leave her store after they knocked over several wig displays. “They started saying something like some racial words like, ‘Asian people shouldn’t be in the Black market,’” Lee said. “We’re stealing their money.” The video showed the women returning to the store, knocking over the displays again. Young eventually charged at Kim, punching her at least eight times. Lee said the women also scratched his face as he tried to fight them off his mother. Lee said the situation escalated when the pair nearly ran him and his father over with their vehicle in the parking lot. Williams has been charged with assault, while Young has been charged with aggravated assault.",

Let's go to the Gateway Pundit where Joe Hoff reports that her husband is the greatest president in the modern era and one additional reason is that his wife Melania Trump is the most beautiful first lady. In history well on Valentine's Day this year the beautiful Melania Trump showed her golden heart in reaching out and reminding the world of the brave children and their families. Spending Valentine's Day in the hospital. Melania Trump is so gracious. She's beautiful and strong. The attacks on her husband and her for the past few years were the most abusive in the US, if not world history. But she stood strong by her husband's side in some of those very difficult situations. Now she put out this tweet here. On this Valentine's Day, I think of the brave inspirational children at the Children's Inn where I visited the past few years, sending them love and strength today and everyday, and she attached some of these beautiful, heartwarming images from her time that she spent there with those children. Absolutely beautiful moments that those children will never forget. There's no question that Melania has the grace and beauty that we have never seen in a first lady. Now today she's working hard for the American people and her family, she announced on Twitter that she's opening her. Own office Miss Melania Trump is announcing the opening of the office of Melania Trump. Please follow this account for news and updates. I'm sure the trolls are going to flood into that account. They say that the focus of her office will be an extension of Melania Trump's B best slogan while at the White House that focus on children's Wellness and safety.

https://www.bitchute.com/video/9ZQGr4vmKjo/,"Joe Biden Promotes Coronavirus Vaccine with ""Boy Beauty Vlogger"" Manny MUA",The White House on Monday published a video with a YouTube male makeup artist to encourage Americans to get the coronavirus vaccine.,"If you were to be stranded on a desert island and you had to bring one product with you, a skin care product that you might really love, what would it be? Some sunscreen. There we go. Welcome to the YouTube Town hall on COVID-19 vaccination with President Joe Biden and Doctor Anthony Fauci. My name is Karine Jean Pierre and I'll be hosting these conversations that we're going to have today. Now listen, we are doing this today because we wanted to partner up with some of your favorite creators. To have a conversation about the importance of getting vaccinated, let's get started with our first conversation. Manny MU a Manny MA. Can you hear me? Are you guys doing doing well doing fine? How are you? I'm doing fantastic. Do you like so much for doing this with me? I really, really appreciate it. You guys are absolutely have a couple questions for you guys. There's a lot of rumors that are going around that young and healthy people don't need to get the vaccine. You should save it for people who are a little bit older. What do you guys think about that? Both your guys's thoughts young. Children, even though when they get infected it's unlikely that they would have a serious disease compared to an elderly person or a person who has an underlying condition they are not exempt from getting serious illness. So you want to protect the youngsters, be they adolescence, be they young children, you want to protect them. There's no doubt about it. But then there's also the responsibility that you have of not being part of spreading the infection throughout the Community, so you almost want to take what I call as societal. Responsibility protecting children also protect society, as I've heard rumors about you know, of course a vaccine passport when you need to confirm whether you have the vaccine or not to travel or go to concerts, etcetera. Do you feel like that is going to be something that's going to be implemented more? These Brewers of vaccine passports, I think it just plays the paranoia and and some people, particularly with younger people, and that's just not the case. But if you've been vaccinated, you don't need to wear a mask. And if you're not, you should wear a mask for your own safety sake and for the sake of the people you care a great deal about the people you love. It's so easy for people to get a vaccine. All you have to do is text your ZIP code and the number 438829. They'll tell you exactly where you can go to get a vaccine. You can get it quickly and you know what Uber and Lyft have come along, and they've said that for the end of May all the way through the July 4th, anybody who calls them, they'll pick them up, take them to a vaccine. Site wait for them and take them back. That's a big deal. That's amazing, honestly, that's incredible. I love that they did an initiative like that like that's absolutely amazing and so responsible of them. You know, for my last question, President Biden, because I am a beauty guru myself, you know, I do have to ask if you were to be stranded on a desert island and you had to bring one product with you, a skin care product that you might really love, what would it be? I think my wife before I headed to that island would tell me that you better bring some sunscreen there we go. That was all the questions I had. I want to say thank you so much. Thought you have a great day you too."

Then R, wait for it, wait for it. Sexist men are sexier than woke men. And it would seem that the ranks of the Soylent are friend zoned for a reason. But why? Well, the answer to that you will have in just a few short minutes. A big thanks to Raid Shadow Legends for sponsoring this video.

We'll work 50 gems and XP boosters, some energy refills, and even an ancient Shard. As soon as you get started. All of this treasure will be waiting for you here. So good luck and I appreciate the support. I read the game penetrating the Secret Society of pickup artists by Neil Strauss a number of years ago, and it's the chronicle of his journey and encounters in the quote seduction community. Closed quote. However, I'm much more familiar with a man named Rush who is an American, former PUA or pickup artist, and perhaps more appropriately, a pug, a pickup guru. Now I became familiar with Rouge who previously has written books on the so-called manosphere and how to become a PA, mostly because of the reaction to them and to him personally by radical feminists and institutional organizations that exist solely to be professionally offended. To their detractors, the typical PUA is a person who studies the art of manipulating women by using sophisticated tactics and psychological tricks to seduce them. Like women haven't been doing this to men since forever. But that's not the point. The PA's themselves would describe their actions and the way they have learned, or the techniques they've learned is. They would probably say they are teaching men how to behave in an assertive, dominant way that will give them more success with the average woman. Anyway, the point is that with Rush, because he was a pug or a pickup guru, well he was targeted by those same radical feminists and the failing legacy media as well as other allies like the ADL, the SPLC and other male feminists. And in fact they succeeded in getting his events cancelled. His books removed from Amazon and him being personally banned from PayPal, YouTube and many other sites for being a quote. Misogynist closed quote. Now I used the story of Rouge to point out some very important things about the society in which we live in. And that is to point out the current cultural taboo of stating any opinion that runs counter to radical feminism and the goal of smashing the patriarchy in the West. Which is this goal, which is, by the way, enforced by the institutions, the banks, the judiciary and big tech among others. And to say any opinion against this ideology is tantamount to not only blasphemy, but modern sacrilege. And for that reason I will be focusing on a social science paper. And the ability for it to replicate its findings on a subject that most people intuitively understand. But the professionally offended will kick up a cacophony of outrage to lament against, and that is that women, including those that self identify as feminists, I'll say that again, women, including those that self identify as feminists, find bad boys as they were. Sexier than they do woke male feminists. Now just a quick interjection. I'd like to say that things that most people intuitively understand as common sense shouldn't be controversial, especially controversial things to say, and it's only because we live in a hopelessly dysfunctional society that they are. But here we are, and to the Soylent neckbeard men that rant on about toxic masculinity and other such drivel on platforms like YouTube and Twitter. Take heed. Here is your study and the reason you get friend zoned rather than get the girl. Now while the more militant feminists will condemn other women that prefer sexist and domineering men rather than softer, more vulnerable male feminists as being women that are foolish, uneducated, deluded. Sometimes traitors to other women, or as internalizing patriarchal misogynist views. Well, of course in an era of me too, and other hyper woke rallying cries to even question the oppression hierarchy is controversial. However, research does suggest that women, including feminists, find sexist men more attractive. There it is. In a paper titled Benevolent Sexism and Mate Preferences, Why do Women prefer benevolent Men despite recognizing that they can be undermining authors go and cup for carried out? A series of experiments testing women's attraction to different types of men and then teasing out women's motivations. While many previous social science studies on the topic have been unable to replicate their findings in this particular study, it suggested. That specifically, men who display what they termed benevolent sexism. Well, these men may be seen by women as being more interested in investing resources in a woman. In contrast to woke male feminists. In a write up on that study, David Lee describes benevolent sexism as thus. Women should be put on a pedestal. Women should be cherished and protected by men. Men should be willing to sacrifice to provide for women. Women are more virtuous than men. Women are more refined and pure compared to men, and he went on despite aspects of benevolent sexism appearing chivalrous and romantic. Previous research has found that women who endorse these beliefs often demonstrate approval of restrictions. On women's freedoms, independence and autonomy and may impact women's support for gender egalitarianism. They found that women who saw these types of men as more attractive also saw the men as being more willing to protect and care for them and to commit to a relationship even in men who were not being scoped out as potential intimate partners. Women were more likely to see sexist men as more attractive women who were both more and less feminist displayed similar levels of attraction. To sexist men. So this effect isn't the result of women not being quote woke enough closed quote. He also noted that it's important to note that sexism and misogyny are not identical concepts. Kate Main suggested that misogyny is more about control of women rather than about hatred, and argues that sexism is more an ideology that supports the reason why we treat women differently. Now this is just an aside an anecdote, if you will, but these concepts are something that male feminists most being predators posing as house pets don't seem to understand because again, in my experience, most male feminists use their feminism and their support as allies. It's basically used as a sexual technique in it of itself. But intuitively, women basically understand that it might be a better trade off to have a committed partner that will sacrifice for them than it would be to have a woke male feminist partner that expects them to be more independent. And this is something people have known for millennia and have only seemingly forgotten in the last couple of decades. And that is that humans have evolved over 10s of thousands of years, and our gender roles have been evolving simultaneously as we have. Masculinity is no more toxic than femininity is shrill. Both are needed and complement the other, and both are needed when attempting to build a stable society. And a stable society. We obviously do not have, because at this point at least since the 1960s, we are no longer even able to replace ourselves. And that's something to think about. Another thing to think about is that This is why male feminists are friendzoned by most women and snickered at at best, but usually looked down on in disgust by most men that hold traditional values. Now again, none of this should be controversial, let alone controversial. To say it's only because we live in a hopelessly deluded and dysfunctional society where many, if not the majority, are now incapable of discerning reality from ideological ****** ***** that many do believe that it is. So thank God for social scientists and their ability to tell us what we all already know. And as a quick postscript to this video, as far as I understand, Rouche has left the pickup guru life behind him and as converted recently to the Armenian Church. Not an unexpected twist for a man as he gets older and a path. I wish him the very best on. With that said, thank you very much for watching.

She's been in this position for two months, two months. She's been the CDC director. She had a press conference yesterday. Part of the White House, a COVID response task force team Doctor Fauci was there, of course, and now she's out there literally saying that. COVID, which has been around for a year. COVID, which you know, we've seen the downward trend COVID all these people. How many millions of people here in Florida and around the country now Joe Biden's? 100 million shots in arms in the next 50 days, he wants 100,000,000 more shots in the arms. There's three count em. Three FDA approved vaccines that are being delivered every single day, and yet COVID is still a big problem. According to Rochelle walensky. This was here yesterday at the White House. I'm gonna pause here. I'm gonna lose the script and I'm gonna reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom, impending doom, impending doom. This is the message that the director of the Center of Disease Control wants to send out her second month in office. She's gonna lose the script. Also, something someone that works for Joe Biden should never ever do you. Definitely wanna stay on script and she's going to talk about this feeling she has of impending doom, impending doom. I mean, can you admit this is the leader of the organization who's in charge of mitigating this pandemic? They she's there to work diligently and to keep people optimistically looking forward to make sure. That we battle and beat COVID-19 coronavirus, whatever. And she's out there saying, you know, I wake up every day and I have this feeling of impending doom, impending doom. I mean that is not. That is not a good bedside manner. I'm sorry and she goes on. There's more she goes on to say she's she's like basically she's in fear for her life. We have so much to look forward to so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope. But right now I'm scared she's scared. She's scared this is the leader of the CDC and she is. She has a feeling of impending doom, she's scared, or there's something something else. She said about being. I know that feeling of nausea when you read the crisis, standards of care, and you wonder whether they're gonna be enough ventilators to go around and who's going to make that choice. OK, so now she's feeling nauseous, so she's she's feels doomed. She's scared and she's nauseous. I don't feel like she's got the Constitution for this job. I don't feel like. He's got the the the physical fortitude to for such a high important place in the United States of America at this moment. During a pandemic. You don't want the director of the Center for Disease Control to be scared and fearful and feeling like there's this impending sense of doom and nauseous. You need somebody who's I mean. Let's be honest, just less emo, but you know, she says she knows what happens when COVID runs rampant. I know what it's like as a physician to stand in that. Patient room gowned gloved masked, shielded and to be the last person to touch someone else's loved one because they're locked. One couldn't be there, you know I heard this and I thought to myself if she's in there. Gowned gloved, masked and shielded, and she's the last person touching a loved one's arm because their loved one couldn't be there. If she's in there. Masked, gloved, what was it a gowned gloved, masked and shielded? Touching someone's relative? Why couldn't the relative be in there gowned gloved, masked and shielded? I mean what? What's the difference between her and this loved ones, daughter or son or husband or wife? If your husband or wife is dying of COVID and it's OK for the director of the CDC to go in there, gowned and gloved and masked and shielded, why can't I go in there? Why can't you? Why can't the loved ones see each other? Obviously they're not sitting alone. Somebody's getting in. But she's just trying to make you fearful. She's trying to make you fearful that even though you're vaccinated, even though you wear a mask, even though it's been a year, even though your governor says there's no more mask mandate, even though you can go to the go to the beach or Disney World or to the Super Bowl, even though you can do all those things, you should because there's impending doom. And this thing's not over. And so I'm asking you to just hold on a little longer to get vaccinated when you can so that all of those people that we all love will still be here when this pandemic. I definitely I mean, when you get up on on national television at a White House press conference as the director of the Center of Disease Control and say hey guys, I'm gonna go off script for a second. We're all doomed. I feel like you know, maybe a you should have stuck on script and maybe B we find somebody else for the job because I just feel like I feel like she's not she's just not up to the task."

Now, they want to shut down Telegram.

What a fitting title of that position. Nancy Faiza or Fazo or whatever. She threatened telegram with shutting their service down in Germany and I should tell you right away that the German Government has said openly that they have no idea how they would do that technologically. Or legally so in today's video, I want to briefly talk about who this person is and then I want to get to the official narrative of why they want to shut down telegram and then what? I suspect the actual reason is for why they want to shut down telegram in Germany and I want to also tell you right away that it has already begun. They were bothering. I guess Apple and Google. And when you have the Telegram app from the App Store. Or from this play store or whatever, and you didn't download it directly from the Telegram website. Then some comments in some telegram channels are not accessible in Germany. Well I haven't tried it abroad obviously, but in Germany some of the channels there's still available, but the comments under the posts are not available. However, if you uninstall this play store or this App Store version and you get the Telegram version from their website. Directly then it works again. This is something I have checked. I've seen that, and yeah, so this is already starting in Germany. This kind of censorship, even though our Constitution or our basic law they couldn't cassette says in a very, very short sentence that doesn't really leave any room for interpretation. I think censorship is not taking place in Germany, and it sensua findet nicht. But of course it's not. Censorship when a private company does it and is forced to do that by the state. And it's not censorship because it's just a private company. They can do whatever they want as long as it's what the government tells them to do right. Big shout out and thank you to all my supporters and my subscribers. If you like these kinds of talks, these kinds of videos then also follow me on other platforms, especially on Telegram. The Lync is down below so just really briefly. Who is this new minister Nancy Fazer? Eiza whatever. I don't know it's an A umlaut that is spelled ALE that is very uncommon for Germany, but nevertheless that is how it is spelled here. She is from central western Germany from Hessen, Hess born in 1970 and in 88 she already the Social Democratic Party of Germany's SPD. She studied law and while she was politically also active, she worked as a lawyer until she now became the federal minister. For the interior and community, and I notice that there seems to be a little bit of a mistake on the English version of her Wikipedia page, but more about that later, maybe OK so more to the point, what happened? This minister Nancy? She said that she wants to shut down telegram in Germany because she doesn't like the communication that's going on there. She thinks that these are dangerous polls and that some people say very nasty things, sometimes even. Not within the boundaries of our law. Can you believe that? And This is why Germany will shut down telegram. That is of course not possible, as we all know they cannot shut down telegram. It is not even in Germany. They can only make it harder to reach that or to use it in Germany or from Germany. Of course there are VPNs and also Russia. I think they tried to shut it down. They didn't succeed. And then yes you could Kick It Out of the app stores when you pressure. Google and Apple, but you know you can still get this app from somewhere else. Also, legally this is highly questionable because it is not the majority or even a significant part of the communication that is going on on telegram that falls into that category that she described. Nowadays there are church groups and even the Social Democratic Party itself is active on telegram, of course, and it's no longer just young dissidents that are using this now. It's also older people and people from all parts of our society that are using telegram these days and in Germany it became quite large actually and especially two years ago. I really don't know why the Telegram user numbers in Germany went through the roof. I really have no idea why that could be, which brings me already to the actual reason that I suspect to be behind all that. I do not think that our government really cares about some threats or some. Not so nice statements about people and politicians being made on telegram on this social media or messenger app. I have a little suspicion that the real reason behind this maneuver or this pressure right now is that during our little health crisis here in Germany, a lot of people have started to share some experiences they had with the health system or with certain medical procedures and or pharmaceutical products they had to take. Where they reluctantly were taking that the industry, some big companies and our government just thought, oh oh, that should be blocked and you all know what I'm talking about. Of course, if you try to say certain things that happened to you or a friend of yours on let's say Facebook or something, you will be deleted or you will be blocked. So a lot of this is going on on telegram these days. That is where people are exchanging just news and experiences about this or in context. If this current crisis that we are having and this spreading of allegedly false medical information, that is exactly why people, or many people, among many, many other reasons and groups. Of course, why they are going to telegram. And I think this is what our government is targeting here. This is what they don't like. They like to tell the people false numbers, false statistics, and they don't want these people to talk to each other so that they cannot check if that is true. But probable or possible? Because if you talk to a lot of people and none of them corroborates that, and they all actually tell you a different story than what are the odds, I think you can calculate then with basic statistics you can calculate what are the odds that the government is lying, but isn't that really revealing? Isn't that really telling a story when the German government, now in 2022, just wants to shut down communication that they don't like? Digest, you know, using phrases like we need to shut down telegram that is no longer being reminiscent of North Korea and China. This is exactly like North Korea and China. This free society and this open society that they were talking about was just a lie. Or let's say free and open. It is only for people that they like and it is not free and not open for people that they dislike. Just consider what is the only group of people that is allowed. To freely travel internationally right now? Yes, exactly. So you see more and more. Our societies are not working in our favor anymore. Our institutions are used against us and it is other people who are empowered and promoted and who are given all these freedoms that we used to have all right. So before I conclude, I just wanted to say just look at the English version of the Wikipedia page of Nancy Faisa. It is really curious to me because in the German article it doesn't say anything about what kind of family she was born into and in the English version it says so and there is even a source being given here and that source #2 that you see maybe on the screen shot now and when you go there that is the website of the Hessian Parliament I think and that says that she is Catholic and it doesn't say what kind of family she was born into and that is why this point is very suspicious. To me, because such a source, you know, a parliament website that gives a short a very short compressed CV with some personal data. In principle that doesn't give you that information like what kind of family someone was born into. That's not there. It just said that her current religious affiliation is Catholic, and that's it. So the source doesn't really contain that, and you know, because it made me so curious. I even used the way back machine to see if there was a recent change, but it always says. Catholic, so that was haha funny person or something. Somebody must have slipped that in and yeah, well Wikipedia right? I mean that is not a source I would trust and here once again I think that's just plain wrong. Someone ought to correct that. I guess all right enjoy the rest of your day servos harden."

And the difficult truth is, every public health measure we have left. Comes with a massive cost to people in their lives. But we have never shyed away from doing what's necessary. We have made the deliberate decision to temporarily enhance police officers authority for the duration of the Stay at Home order. Moving forward, police will have the authority to require any individual who is not in a place of residence to 1st provide their purpose for not being at home and provide their home address. Police will also have the authority to stop a vehicle to inquire about an individual's reason for leaving their residents, and our inspectors will also be ensuring that those who absolutely must come to work are strictly following the public health measures. For our employers and employees, take note. This is your last warning. I'm wondering about these new police powers to just randomly stop someone walking down the street or to pull over a car. What happens if if a person refuses to answer the police question? So by issuing these new additional enforcement measures, it allows police officers to ask the person why they are not at their place of residence and what their place of residence is, and specifically to your question. If you are not willing to comply, then you are breaking the law. If someone sees their neighbors breaking these, these new regulations and and having a party in their yard, that sort of thing should, should people call police. On their neighbors in terms of people calling to snitch to inform look, we all have a personal responsibility. If it means saving lives, then I think we have to think about what your social responsibilities are as an individual to make sure that you don't empower other people and invite a whole bunch of individuals to your home."

Full preparation and cooking instructions.For more BBQ recipes check out my website www.BBQFOOD4U.com,"Welcome to barbecue food for you. I'm kinger and today we're going to be showing everyone a simple, easy, and delicious way to cook up a beef tenderloin roast on a Weber kettle barbecue. Following meatheads easing simple directions from amazingribs.com on the secrets of beef rose, let's get to it. Start with the top end of a beef tenderloin roast or any decent cut of beef. Go ahead, remove any excess silver. You are fat. And we're going to take some butchers twine, tie it up and try and make it nice and round. Next we're going to add a little injection of butchers barbecue prime injection just for a little extra flavor. Just start on one end. Simply work your way down. Give me a little squirt every inch or two. After injecting the roast with another layer of flavor, simply take it, place it in a Ziploc bag. Leave it in the fridge for at least two to four hours just before you get your meat on the grill. Spice it up with any type of rubs or spices that you love to taste. For this, all we're going to do is put on some extra bold black peppercorns and a little bit of kosher salt. He's got a nice coat and a salt and pepper, so let's go get it on the grill. Barbecues all up to temp in the woods starting to smoke away so we just got our meat on. Cook it at 2:25 till it hits an internal temp of 115 degrees and we'll give it a nice sear on the outside after around half an hour keep a close eye on the temperature and just keep checking it. 117 on the end. 1:15 in the middle. And 113 on the end. Once you have an internal temperature of 115 to 120 degrees, simply take the beef. Even an eye on it turning it every 30 seconds or so. And another quick little roll. No, it's great. Again, another quick rule we're going to. If you like your beef cooked a little bit more than that, simply bring up the internal temperature to 125 degrees and then start searing it after letting it rest for around 5 minutes, loosely tented and tinfoil trying to remove the string and slice it up. With the string removed, it's all ready to slice, so let's cut into it and see how it looks. Hmm, check that out. Nice juicy. Cut some thin slices off here. Just like butter. Going to make up a couple sandwiches. Looking good. Beef tenderloin roast. It's easy to do barbecue food for you. Give it a try."

Freshly cracked. Black pepper seasoning. Give that quick mix round. And then. It's. Into the blender. To get blitzed. Once it's been in the blender. Back into the pan. Then you can put it on the heat again. Because what you're going to do. That is not too much better. A tad watery, so all you're going to do is heat it on a simmer again and just reduce it down to the consistency that you're after. And then you've got a beautiful Madras sauce. Once you've got it down to a consistency, you're happy with, time to go in with whatever you've chosen. I've chose. Chicken tikka. Because it's delicious, you can see the recipe. From my other videos, if you like. Either way, you can go in with cold mam beef, prawns king prawns. What do you like and enjoy your spicy dinner?"

https://www.bitchute.com/video/W8GM4sSDWxIc/,The Competes Act: 10s of Billions for China,"Democrats want to send your money to their Communist Chinese partners in crime. 50 Billion+, every year.","I wanted to ask you a question about this competes act, which helps American chip makers compete against the Chinese ones. The letter from the President supporting that. I wonder what you make of that. Well, we would like to compete with China. We want to be able to beat China, especially when it comes to chips and others as we see a problem supply chain. Unfortunately, the bill that the Democrats are bringing to the floor does nothing of that. It mentions coral reef more than once in China. It puts the. Build back better issues into the bill. It actually helps China compete against America. Do you think it's strange that the president's letter of support does not mention China very much? So I mean, some of the biggest threats we have to this country long term are the size of our debt. We just went over 30 trillion and China and this new this administration and also when you look to. The speaker, they'd will not hold China accountable. Why aren't we investigating the origins? The origins of COVID? We're now going to 900,000 Americans have been killed, and next week they're going to honor China. With the Olympics we we had arrested numerous people that were spying with China, and now we're finding that this new administration is not prosecuting them. Why is the change all of a sudden that they're bowing to China? Instead of helping us compete against them so that we make sure the next century is the American Century, Peter Schweitzer, the author, came out with a book with a number of allegations of ties between the Biden family and China. Do you think there's any credibility to those those facts they put forward in his book? You haven't been able to read the book yet, but I ordered it raises lots of questions and there's a lot of questions out there based upon what Hunter, Biden and others have done. And I think they need to be answered. It's really a bill to have America concede. To China on a lot of fronts. I mean, the bill gives slush funds to China. You know, there's a fund that's given over $100 million to China, and they add billions of dollars to that fund. Why would we be giving taxpayer money to China right now? We need to be investigating the origins of COVID holding China accountable, not giving them taxpayer money. They had $54 billion in new mandatory spending, which means every single year that spending happens no matter what at a time of high inflation. You don't need to be jacking up inflation with more Washington spending. They do a lot of other things in this bill that actually hurt American jobs. They're going to have this global police force to go around the globe trying to shut down manufacturing all in the name of global warming and climate change like the party. That's for defunding the police here in America is trying to hire officers to shut down manufacturing in other countries. And in the United States, all in the name of climate change. This. This is such a misguided bill. Thank you, Sir. Sure. Who is who commits most violent murders on prime time TV and on on on gangster or or or movies? Not the people who actually commit violent crime. In America, it's all businessmen. White business professionals commit all the crimes. And when one speaks as I have done to some of the Hollywood producers involved in this rubbish, they say yeah, because they're the only group that has no defence league. Anyone else will be on us if we make them the bad guys."

Stock up on Survival Fo..","Yes, Sir, Don Lemon goes off on air in support of his former boss on CNN. Before I get to that report, I'm rich crankshaw, host of Crankiest American on YouTube. Welcome to the next news network. Take a moment to like, comment, share and hit that notification Bell so you are the first to know when news breaks. CNN should change their genre to low quality satire. They seem to be entertaining the country with the number of people either arrested, fired or forced to quit in the past year. Don Lemon, who is no stranger to sexual misconduct, allegations himself defended his former boss, Jeff Zucker after he resigned under scandal. Landon Ryan from town hall reports CNN anchor Don Lemon gave an emotional testimony on former network president Jeff Zucker during the latest broadcast of his night time program, claiming that his ex boss made the Liberal news outlet relevant again. Lemon said Friday on Don Lemon tonight. That it has been a tough few days for CNN employees and that they are all heartbroken because the loss of our leader. He said that it has been hard to come into work this week. For the more than 3000 CNN employees, take a look if you want jaded so everyone of personal message that I want to deliver at the top of the show and hang on one second. Just grab the notes here. A lot of folks have been watching wondering what's happening. It's been a really tough day. Today, in a tough few days for us here at CNN all week, really. I didn't want to talk about it until tonight. So the truth is that we're all heartbroken because we lost our leader here. We lost the man who was the backbone, the glue and the spirit of this company. The man who I personally credit with changing my life. A man who believed in me when nobody else did. He is the reason that you have a gay black man with two hours of prime time. A show with my name on it. The only anchor of color in prime time cable news. Think about that you want to talk about diversity. Here it is. It has been hard to come into work this week, not only for me, but for so many. Of us here at CNN, my colleagues 3000 of us more than 3000 of us. So let me just say this to my colleagues who may not have been here as long as I have the younger folks who haven't weathered these storms. I've been at this network for almost 16 years. We have been through ups and downs, ratings, highs, rating, lows, everything, regime changes. We've been through a lot. And through it all our mission has remained the same to deliver the facts, to deliver the news. It is what we did when Ted Turner turned the lights on. Here it is what we did through 2 Gulf Wars through 911 through Katrina through an insurrection. Jeff Zucker may not have launched this network, but he revived it. He made it relevant again. He studied it for the last decade. He left us with a very good blueprint going forward. So for all of you at home watching. You should know that I and my colleagues will continue to do exactly what he would want us to do, and that is to do what I'm going to do right now. Deliver the news no matter what it is without fear or favor. So thank you Jeff Zucker for everything you did for everyone at this network. And what for what you did through the entire country for the entire country. So. Let's just move on. Good evening everyone. Well, Gee, what do you say? I mean, OK, the diversity thing great, but what does that have to do with delivering the news and especially delivering the news truthfully? OK, so you can. You can sidetrack everybody on on the fact that you're you know, a gay black man on prime time, which is great. OK Hallelujah, I mean I didn't support Obama but I kind of had a little tear in choked up. Given the fact that how far our countries come, and having a black president that was that was an accomplishment. OK, but it has nothing to do with running the country and your social order. Your social position in life has nothing to do with telling the news truthfully. And this comes after Zucker released a statement Wednesday announcing his resignation from CNN over his failure to disclose his relationship with. Colleague Allison Gaullist, an executive vice president and chief marketing officer during the. Investigation into disgraced former network anchor Chris Cuomo. Cuomo was fired in December following revelations about his involvement in aiding his brother, disgraced former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo against a slew of sexual harassment allegations. During the investigation, Chris Cuomo was also accused of sexual misconduct against a former colleague from his time at ABC News. Gaust, who will continue her employment with CNN, said in her own statement that she and Zucker have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years, but that recently their relationship changed during the pandemic. The relationship has been called an open secret by media personalities and former CNN employees. Since Zucker's resignation, revelations about his relationship with Gaullist have been reported. Including how the relationship dates back to 1996. When she was a trainee and he was an executive producer of NBC's Today Show. The couple also gave talking points to Governor Cuomo, Gaullist former boss. To respond to attacks from then President Donald Trump during daily coronavirus briefings in the early months of the pandemic, Zucker and Gaullist were reportedly instrumental in Governor Cuomo's appearance. On his brother show Cuomo prime time in 2020, and Gallus personally asked the governor to continue his CNN appearances after his office started to oppose scheduling. More interviews with the Cuomo brothers. So Don Lemon called Jeff Zucker a good guy, and that's not a great look in the midst of all the scandals that are riding CNN, I get that he worked under Zucker for a while at CNN, but it doesn't look great for lemon. So do you think Don Lemon is coming up on the chopping block himself, glorifying your boss after he resigns for a negative reputation? Your network is known for. Is not something someone boasts about, but Lemon saw nothing wrong with it to call CNN relevant was perhaps the overstatement of the year. That's what happens when denial sets in, and there's nothing left to report. So do you believe CNN is still relevant? Comment below subscribe for updates.

Opening ceremonies and after the ceremonies, the story just gets worse. Before we get to this report, I'm rich crankshaw, host of Crankiest American on YouTube. Welcome to the next news network. Take a moment to like, comment, share and hit that notification Bell so you are the first to know when news breaks. Yes, so it all started with the Olympics being held in Tokyo during the summer of 2021. Now people are being asked to tune in to watch the Winter Olympics. It's not only bad timing. Millions of Americans distrust the CCP and don't want to support them with their views. Now there is news that the Olympics are paying the price. Let's find out what's happening. Rebecca Downs from town Hall, reports some good news out of the attention surrounding the Beijing Winter Olympics games. Is that the opening ceremony? From Friday, drew record low ratings. The reasons should be obvious stemming first and foremost from how it's occurring in a country where genocide is taking place. These games have been dubbed names such as Genocide, games and the Genocide Olympics. When it comes to the actual number. Dan wetzel. Explained in his column for Yahoo Sports that just 16 million tuned in for the opening ceremonies. This new record low isn't even close as the previous record was twenty point 1,000,000 for the 1988 games in Calgary. The last Winter Games in 2018 held in Pyeongchang. Had 28.3 million viewers. Olympics opening ceremonies draws record low ratings. Why aren't Americans tuning in was wetzel's headline? Unfortunately, propaganda isn't just coming from the International Olympic Committee IOC. Which allowed the games to take place in Beijing in the 1st place, NBC refused to air an ad from Representative Mike Wallace, Republican from Florida, with a message from himself and Ennis Cantor freedom of. When you see made in China, put it down. Take a look. The world's greatest athletic showcase, but just outside the show. Rape, genocide, slave labor. American companies are drunk on Chinese dollars entangled with communist dictators committing atrocities and propping up these genocide games staged by the Chinese Communist Party. And what can we do for freedom? We found the dictators when you see made in China, put it down. Servant Leadership Fund is responsible for the content of this advertising. That's how it should be. You know when Pelosi went public and actually. You know, basically cobbled to the Communist Party showing complete weakness, letting them have their way. That was a disgrace to this country when she should have said flat out instead of. Ohh, you're athletes should be quiet because we don't know what the Communist Party will do to you. You should have said if you lay a single hand or harm these people in any way Americans there will be consequences or she should have announced we're not going. Why would we put our athletes in harm's way? One of those makes no sense things. So people already are also already watched, or rather didn't watch the Tokyo Olympics just last summer. Which were supposed to take place in 2020 but had been postponed due to the virus. Such as. Another ridiculous reason for China to be the host country after a virus that has killed millions originated there. As China is going for a zero virus policy, the fate for those who happened to test positive for the viruses to be quarantined in isolation with poor living conditions with bad food and no equipment. Anyone with common sense could have seen this coming the the viewership of the Olympics has dropped to an all time low. There are athletes in quarantine right now that are alleging being fed terrible meals. And it's good to see the Americans don't want to watch these games to send a message. Now we should always support our athletes who train their entire lives. For this though. So will you be? Will you be watching the Olympics this year? Comment below subscribe for updates.

So after the Governor of California and one of his mayors mandated facial protection against CVS, they were caught red handed, breaking their own rules at a basketball game. These children followed their example and got frozen out. Let's find out what happened at Eric Thompson from trending politics reports the conflict between woke schools demanding jabs and students whose families are rejecting them for their children is increasing. As children returned in person learning last fall, multiple stories of abuse started getting reported nationwide. In December, a short video appeared showing a group of children sitting on buckets outside a school and eating lunch. Which was shared widely online drawing anger and criticism from parents. Take a look. Now, in the latest example of tyranny as a high school students in Oakdale, CA Joint Unified School District began protesting the state's mask mandate. After Governor Newsom was spotted at a 49ers game without a mask. The school administration went crazy. Hundreds of students in Oakdale were banned from class for not wearing their masks. The students say they were following Governor Gavin Newsom's example after photos showed him maskless at the NFC Championship game over the weekend. The students were bare faced and packed into the Oakdale High School gym. Freshman Nolan Harris was one of them. By the end of the day, there was about 100 kids in there, he said. If they. If they don't follow by their own rules. That they're trying to force upon us upon me. Why should I follow them, Harris said. When the high schoolers showed up to school without masks this week, far left school staffers used lunch tables to barricade the children in the school's gym. According to reopen, public schools on Twitter, confirmed staff attempted to barricade the Maskless high schoolers in the gym by putting tables in front of the exits. A staff member also was caught turning down the thermostat to freeze them out. Public schools have evolved in Marxist portals, promoting social justice causes. In addition to producing youth unequipped to join the workforce, they're also acting as their children's guardians. Once they've walked onto the school grounds. In California, the teachers unions have told the media that their members don't have to get parental permission before discussing transitional genders with elementary students. Coordinating a ride for a pregnant student to an abortion clinic, etcetera. Stein parents pull your children for their sake. Once again, it's rules for thee, not for me. The leadership of California, a state that imposes the strictest CV policies. Why were high school kids even surprised? That's children would start resisting. After the blatant hypocrisy. These children have every right to be upset and we hope it opens the eyes of millions of Californians. So what do you think? Do you support them? Comment below. Subscribe for updates.

Stock up on S..","Wait till you see who Biden put in charge of Russia. Ukraine conflict. Before we get to this report, I'm rich crankshaw, host of Crankiest American on YouTube. Welcome to the next news network. Take a moment to like, comment, share, hit that notification Bell so you are the first to know when news breaks. So will Russia attack Ukraine? Leave it to the Biden administration to lean on Jake Sullivan to give advice on what could happen. This is the same guy who has been accused of peddling the Russia hoax and is now their national security adviser. We're in some serious trouble now. If Biden is listening to this guy. Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit reports. It has been widely reported that White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan is facing scrutiny for the his major role that he played in pushing the Trump Russia hoax. As a senior foreign policy adviser to Hillary Clinton, Sullivan spearheaded what was known inside her campaign as a confidential project to link Trump to the Kremlin through dubious email server records provided to the agencies said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Now, as you recall, Hillary's campaign lawyer Michael Sussman, was indicted in September for lying to the FBI. According to the indictment, Sussman falsely told FBI counsel James Baker. He wasn't doing work for any client when he asked for a meeting with the FBI when he presented bogus evidence the Trump Tower was secretly communicating with Kremlin tied Alpha Bank. Fox News producer Jake Gibson reported in November that Jake Sullivan is mentioned in the indictment of Michael Sussman. But Jake Sullivan's previous involvement in one of the greatest lies in modern day politics has not prevented him from serving under Joe Biden or from joining the mainstream media and being treated as a respected foreign policy expert. On Sunday morning, as the drive for war by the Biden regime intensifies, Jake Sullivan joined Martha McCallum on Fox News. During the discussion, Sullivan admitted a war with Russia in Ukraine will result in enormous human cost to the Ukrainians and strategic cost to Russia. Why be here today? I'd like to start with this. Sources are telling us that Russia is now quote 70% ready to launch an invasion in Ukraine. Because they are now or will soon be upwards of 130,000 troops and significant new presence of jets, missiles, anti aircraft equipment in Russia and in in Belarus north of Ukraine. But the US and Ukraine have sent mixed signals on whether or not they think that an invasion will actually happen. So what can you tell us this morning is an invasion imminent. Well, what I can tell you, Martha is that we are in the window any day now. Russia could take military action against Ukraine or it could be a couple of weeks from now. Or Russia could choose to take the diplomatic path instead. The key thing is that the United States needs to be and is prepared for any of those contingencies in lockstep with our allies and partners. We have reinforced and reassured our allies on the eastern flank. We have united the West. We have provided material support to Ukraine. All the President Biden's. Connection and we have also offered Russia a diplomatic path if they choose to take it. If war breaks out, it will come at an enormous human cost to Ukraine. But we believe that based on our preparations and our response, it will come at a strategic cost to Russia as well. And that's what we're learning, according to Chairman of Joint Chiefs Mark Miley. Very saying that Kiev could have could fall within 72 hours if there is an invasion that 50,000 people could be killed. What do you think is the likelihood that there's a surprising quick fall of Keith? Look, my job here is not to predict what exactly will happen day-to-day. It is to prepare for any contingency, including a contingency where Russian forces drive on the Ukrainian capital. Well, he is predicting it. They are predicting it. You know, they're claiming what they're claiming is the classic description of what is the false flag which you know traditionally. They say that's conspiracy theory, but it's actually been proven. You know the fact you can go back to the Civil war in in that regard, and so we had this discussion online with some very smart friends of mine back and forth. And you know this in and of itself is the false flag talking about a false flag, in our opinion. Of course, that's the basic. Consensus anyway, and I guess they don't seem too worried about the loss of Ukrainian lives. And if war breaks out, the Ukrainian rubes don't matter to the war mongers in DC. Now, how can we trust anything Sullivan says he was part of the Hillary team that lied. To try and destroy Trump in the Russia Gate hoax? Honestly, how does someone like this have any security clearance? Let alone being the national security adviser. This is the corruption Biden has allowed into his White House. Now he's giving advice on how to deal with Russia. Can't make this stuff up, so tell us how out of control you think this White House is. Comments below. Subscribe for updates.

On Thursday, September 23, the victim, Vladimir Zh. Told Lente.ru about this. According to a local publication, the incident took place on September 21. A Muslim woman wearing a hijab came to the reception. “I did not see anything strange in this, I have been working in the city for several years, the patients came in hijab earlier, the procedure is the same for everyone. For examination, I asked her to show her arms, legs, stomach - she had to bare literally 10 centimeters each, ”said Vladimir Zh. According to him, the patient was indignant, saying that she was not supposed to do this, but the doctor replied that the norms were the same for everyone. “Half an hour later, her husband burst into the office with the phrase“ do you like to look at women's tummies? ”He didn't say anything else but started beating me. In my practice, anything happened, they even came with a knife, but no one used it. But this time it didn't come to a conversation ”- summed up the victim.",

Fat Burning At Homehttps://youtu.be/NFNIx-3DKcc #Yoga #sleep #PsycheTruth","Hey, it's Karina and thank you so much for clicking on my video today we're doing another lazy yoga class where the whole class will be reclined down on our backs. We'll be doing some gentle hip openers for beginners, so when we start to open the hips and stretch through the inner thighs a little bit, this can do a lot to relieve a little bit of low back pain. And it's also just a really great kind of unwinding and emotional release, so it's a great video to do at the end of the day. Or really any time of day. If you're not able to join me right now, go ahead and add this video to your watch later and you can come back and join me whenever you have the time. So we'll start today's class, reclining down on our backs. So nice and gently, we'll start to prepare here, plant your feet on the floor in front of you and just take a moment to find a nice tall spine here. From here we'll place the hands behind us. You can lift your hips up a little bit, to scoot the hips forward and start coming down onto your forearms. Go ahead and pause here for a moment and then nice and gently. Here you can use your hands to assist. You will come on down to our backs. So take a moment here, just starting to kind of find that connection with the mat underneath you, and take a moment to notice that you have a little curve underneath the low spine. It's natural for us to have that lumbar curve, but since we're going to lift our legs into the air, go ahead and think about gently tucking the tailbone so you just seal that little gap under the floor. From here, we'll go ahead and lift the knees up, keeping them nice. And bed here go ahead and reach your arms around your knees and we're just going to start to hug them into the chest. So here we're just bringing some nice gentle compressions through the hip flexors. If this is already feeling really intense for you, then go ahead and spend a few moments here. Just breathing into the hips feeling this nice stretch that we're getting. And after a moment here, we'll come to pause for a moment and then wrap your hands underneath your thighs. So between the thigh and the knee, hug the thighs in again and maybe a little bit closer to the chest this time. Starting to really connect with your breath here, so notice that you can take a nice full deep breath. Really extend your exhale. So it's nice and slow and calm. From here, go ahead and plant your left foot back down on the mat. This time we'll just hug that right knee in. When we are doing both legs at once, it's a lot more intense, so we'll be doing things one like at a time through this class, helping you kind of get used to these shapes a little bit before we come into our full happy baby pose. So right now we're thinking about bringing the knee kind of straight up toward kind of the I guess collarbone. You can say. And now I want you to go ahead and open that hip a little. So now we're thinking about bringing the knee kind of towards the right shoulder. Keep hugging that leg in. And notice that as you pull this leg to the right, your left hip kind of wants to roll up off the mat, but go ahead and roll that left hip back down and I just want you to think about trying to keep the low back nice and sealed with the mat, trying to keep both hips. Down on the ground. And now we're just going to switch the legs so nice and gently, here starting to relax that right leg. We'll hug the left knee in here, hugging in both knees for a second and then holding on to the left as you go ahead and plant that right foot down on the mat. So once again, we'll hug this knee in. Kind of thinking about. Feeling that intensity through the hip flexor since the hip flexor on this leg. But I'm going to show you on the right side, so a lot of times these hip flexors are kind of a combination of weakness and just being in the same position all the time, mainly sitting. There's a lot of benefit of getting into the hip flexors and now we'll think about bringing this left knee towards the left shoulder. Opening that hip a little bit, but still thinking about sending that right hip down to the floor so you're not letting that right? Hip lift. You're kind of keeping the low back sealed with the mat and just starting to open that left knee towards the left shoulder. Breathe in at any point that you start to notice that you're moving into a stretch that feels too intense or that makes you start to hold your breath or grit your teeth come out of the stretch a little bit. Think about maintaining that nice calm breath slow controlled exhalations. Great, so bringing that left knee back in towards center. Bring that right knee up again, hugging them both in maybe noticing if now you're really able to fully compress that hip flexor. So fully hugging the thigh towards the upper body. So this time we'll plant that left foot back down again, hug that right knee, and for a minute, and then we're going to start to slowly straighten the right leg, but keep the knee pretty generously bent at first, just pointing and flexing through the foot here a little bit and starting to wrap the hands around the right thigh, hugging the right thigh into the chest and just feeling how now we're feeling this kind of stretch through the hamstring. It's quite intense through the hip flexor and then take a hold of your leg, either keeping it here if that feels good for you or starting to reach toward the calf. Hug that knee and again and as you're here, you'll notice we're starting to come into that kind of hip opening shape so the knee is kind of directing out toward the shoulder. Thinking about pulling this thigh into the rib cage or into the upper body here. So we're starting to come into a little half happy baby shape so the foot is kind of could be planted on the ceiling. And we're really bringing this right knee into the right shoulder. Slowly exhale. And then starting to bring this leg back through center, bend that knee, hug the knee and lift that left knee and again. Hugging in both knees for a moment. And then we'll plan that right foot down. Hugging in the left knee for a moment starting to open it up to the sides, we're getting that little hip opener and then slowly starting to straighten that leg. So we keep the knee mostly bent here. Hug the thigh and towards the upper body. And then if it feels OK for you to start reaching down the leg a little bit, pulling that knee in toward the shoulder or toward the armpit however you want to think about it now, we really feel this activation and stretch. Kind of getting into the quad. The hip. There's a lot going on as you start to move into this shape. And then nice and gently bringing that knee back through center, hug the knee and once more and bring that right knee up as well. So now we're going to do a gentle reclined pigeon pose that kind of helps us stretch the side of the glute and the IT band a little bit. So from here we'll take the right leg and start to open that right knee out, planting the side of the right ankle on the left knee. We're just below the left knee. From here you can use this right hand to remind this hip to open. So what you'll notice a lot when we start to do this is the knee stays really close to the body when we're thinking about opening our hips, we want to send that knee out and away from us. So as you do that thinking about kind of using this right hand to just gently remind that need to open, you can pull that left leg in toward you. So this is quite intense. This is a great place to just breathe for a few moments. If you're not able to fully bring this leg all the way towards the chest, just find the place where you start to feel that nice intense stretch. You can maintain your calm breathing. And if you're starting to feel at any time that this knee starts to feel a little funny as you do, these hip openers gently flex the foot toward the knee. If you want a little bit more, you can reach both arms through hugging that left knee toward you. So now you're really intensifying that stretch through the right loop. Wherever you are is a perfect yoga pose. Just breathe for a moment. And then nice and gently will start to unwind, so letting that left leg go, bringing the knees together. I love coming to this little hug the knees in, in between. And now we'll start to plant the side of the left foot onto the right knee. Once again, reminding this knee that wants to just kind of come hang out really close to you to open up a little bit away from you. Gently bringing this right leg toward you to intensify the stretch and keeping a gentle kind of flex through the left foot. Just keeping the knee pointing back. Just keeping the toe pointing back toward the knee helps keep everything in alignment. If you want a little bit more reaching through, hugging in that right thigh and breathing here. We also hold a lot of emotion in our hips. That's where our reproductive organs are, and. Many of our important hormonal glands as well. So. Sometimes we start to feel some emotions bubbling up for us when we stretch through the hips. That's perfectly normal. Just let those emotions come. You'll always feel better. Once you feel those emotions. Moving through them rather than trying to just ignore them. Really nice, gently unwinding here bringing both knees back into the chest. And then planting that left foot down, hold on to the right knee here. And once again we'll start to slowly, gently straighten that right leg just a little bit. Hugging that, right? Thigh toward you. So once again, notice that you can hug it toward you. Kind of keeping the leg in line. With kind of its normal positioning. And then we can think about opening that knee out, hugging the thigh toward us. And if it feels OK to wrap your arms around the leg here. You can do that. You can take the hands around the shin or the calf. Or if it feels reachable for you, you can reach for the side of that foot. And now we're in our half happy baby. So I've got my left arm down on the ground. It just kind of support me hold me up. And then as you start to bring this leg towards you, just breathe into that compression that you're feeling in the hip. Totally fine if you're still right here, you're still right here. Maybe shaking and quaking as you slowly start to open the leg. Increasing our mobility. Is a lot about just letting these muscles know that it's OK to relax so the muscles are kind of tight. They're trying to protect themselves and then with our nice calm breaths, we let those muscles know. Hey, it's OK to relax. And then that joint is able to become more mobile as the muscles around it let go. Leave here. And then we'll let go of that right leg. Hugging both knees in. Planting the right foot. And slowly starting to straighten this left leg. So once again, hug it in with the knee kind of staying in line. With the collar bone. And then opening that knee out. Hugging it in here. Maybe wrapping the arms around the thigh or really hugged the thigh into the body. We're taking your hands around the shin, the ankle, or reaching for the side of the foot there. Half happy baby on the left side. So you'll encounter happy baby pose and almost every yoga class because it's a great, just feel good pose to kind of open up the heads, let go of a lot of tension that we can accumulate after our practice. But when we're first getting into this pose, it is not easy and it sometimes doesn't feel super happy so we practice it on one side. And then when that starts to feel good or easy, then you can move on to doing. So I'll go ahead and release that foot. We'll hug the knees in here for a moment. And then go ahead and plant both feet down on your mat. We're going to take a really gentle little bridge pose here. Just a nice way to kind of sand the hip flexors into an opposite position. Kind of undoing some of that compression we've done. So with both feet planted here and both arms planted underneath you. We'll start to just find that gentle tuck of the tailbone that seals the low back to the floor and then push into your feet. Feel your quads starting to lift you up. You don't need to lift up very high here. If you want to keep pushing, rising the hips up a little bit more, you feel even more stretched through the hip flexors. And then nice and gently rolling down one vertebrae at a time. Go ahead and walk your feet out to the corners of the mat with the toes pointing inward, allowing the knees to fall in on one another. So now we're going to move into our happy baby pose on both legs. So if it felt really, really intense, just doing one at a time, then go ahead and continue practicing one like at a time before you try your full happy baby. If you're ready to move into happy baby, pose with me. Then we'll go ahead and bring the feedback to a parallel position. Taking a moment to kind of tug that tailbone sealing the low back to the mat, hugging both knees in. And then let's start to slowly straighten the legs. If you'd like, you can straighten them one at a time. So kind of keeping one bed point and flex through one leg. And then straighten the other. Point and flex. Just kind of getting a little hamstring stretch in here for a moment. So what you can? One more time. And if you'd like to have both legs stretching point and flex a few times, go ahead. This is quite an intense stretch for the back of the legs though, so no worries if this is not something that feels good for you. From here, go ahead and hug the knees in. Hugging the knees in here for a moment. Sometimes it feels nice to just gently rock. Have massaged the low back a little bit here. And then we'll start to send the knees out to the side. If you plant the feet together and place your hands around the ankles, here we are in baduk anasyrma bound angle pose also known as butterfly, is another great position to. Just kind of. Hold for a few breaths. And then from here reach your arm around the knee for the outside of your right foot. From here as you start to lift the foot up towards the ceiling. Notice that that compression through the right hip flexor can. I can feel my right quad working here a lot is going on, so you can keep this left foot just kind of relaxed like it is. Or go ahead and come into your full happy baby pose reaching for that left side of the left foot and then remember that as the knees are in here, it's a little bit easier and as the knees open. And the hips open. We really get into the stretch a little more. Breathe here. This is really intense. If it's too intense, go ahead and. Relax one of the legs, just doing one leg at a time. And then we can also work with stretching through the inner thighs here, so I'm going to hold on to my left foot and then start to extend the right leg. It's going to hold on to that knee or calf. Breathing here. And then starting to bend the right knee. Take that right foot and then straighten out that left leg. Back to the full happy baby here. It's like once more straighten out that right leg, so straightening the right leg here I feel it more in the hamstring opening that right hip and stretching. I feel it more in the inner thigh. Just do what feels good for you. I'll bring this one back in. Straightening that left leg here. Moving to that inner thigh stretch. And then nice and gently hugging both knees back in for a moment. So now you have the option to kiss your knees here. So really hugging yourself to a little ball, bringing your nose to your knees. Kiss your knees. Plant the head back down. And then nice and gently will go ahead and plant the feet back on the mat. And then with your arms planted on the mat next to you here as well, we're going to do a little spinal twist. So lifting the hips up, send them a little to the right. That'll let your knees drop over to the left. And then notice that as your knees come over, your shoulder wants to join. But to get the spinal twist, we want to think about letting the right shoulder come back down onto the mat. If this right leg doesn't completely lay down, that's totally fine. You could also use some pillows or bolsters underneath the legs over here to make it a little easier. And then letting your gaze fall over the right hand. If that feels good for you, getting a full spinal twist. The few cycles of breath here. Letting the body just. Start to relax. After a little bit of intense stretching that we did today together. Slowly bring your gaze back through center. If you turned your head. And then you can use your hands to help lift the legs back up. We'll spend just a moment in this little neutral position here. And then with the arms planted, both feet planted on the mat, lifting the hips, sending them a little bit to the left so that the knees fall down to the right. Bringing the left shoulder down as well. As much as possible, letting that left shoulder rest on the mat, and if you'd like go ahead and turn your head gazing over the left hand. For a full spinal twist. So much of our. General Daily stresses. We just start to kind of take it all in without even noticing. But when we focus our attention on destressing focusing on our extended slow exhalations. Can just slowly. Unwind and dissipate all of that stress of our day. Gently bring your gaze back up through center. And then lifting the knees back to the center, you can use your hands to help you. And you can take your shavasana either in that little position where the feet come out to the edge of the mat, the toes point inward, and the knees fall in on one another. This is a great kind of modified shavasana that you can take. This is really nice gentle on the low back. I think I'm actually going to stay here for shavasana, but you are welcome to extend your legs long taking your traditional shavasana. If that is what would feel best for you. Savoring this time together for just a few more breaths. Letting the body integrate. All of this movement and stretching that we've just done together. You're welcome to pause the video here and spend a few silent minutes and shavasana. Or whenever you're ready. We'll start to bring a little movement through the body, wiggling the toes. Go ahead and lift the arms up overhead. Take a nice big stretch and then we'll come to lay on one side of our body. You can use your arm like a little pillow under your head. Then using this hand in front of you to push into the floor and lifting you up. Coming to sit for just a moment here. Go ahead and bring your hands to touch. Placing your hands together at heart Center and then drop your chin towards your chest. Thank you so much for taking some time today for yourself.

https://www.bitchute.com/video/SzLksELsiUA/,Why Muslims Should Be HAPPY About Muhammad Cartoons,"Muslims around the world have been protesting France's stance on freedom of speech, following the republication of some Muhammad cartoons. Multiple people have even been beheaded over these cartoons. David Wood explains why Muslims, instead of being upset, should actually be happy when they see cartoons of Muhammad.","Nothing gets a jihadis blood boiling like a good old Muhammad cartoon. China is literally cramming Muslims into railroad cars and sending them to concentration camps. The reaction to China's anti Muslim genocide from the rest of the Muslim world ranges from mildly concerned to couldn't conceivably care less. But a satirical newspaper in France posted some Mohammed cartoons. The Muslim reaction, international outrage, protests, riots, stabbings and of course, beheadings. Talk about a perfectly functioning moral compass. This is what happens when your ultimate role model is an illiterate 7th century Arabian caravan robber who had sex with a prepubescent girl, tortured a man for money, and ordered his followers to slaughter people for making fun of him. But I'd like to tell our Muslim friends that they should actually be happy about Muhammed cartoons. They should be overjoyed when they see Mohammed cartoons. They should thank Charlie Hebdo for publishing and republishing Mohammed cartoons. Why do I say this? Well, think about it. Mohammed called for the violent subjugation of the entire world, Mohammed said. The Earth was brought together for me so that I could see the east and the West, and I was given 2 treasures. The yellow or the red and the white meaning gold and silver. And it was said to me your Dominion will extend as far as has been shown to you. So Islam, according to Mohammed, will control the east and the West. Mohammed said, I've been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no God but Allah, that Mohammed is the messenger of Allah and they establish prayer and pay the cut. And if they do it their blood and property are guaranteed protection on my behalf except when justified by law and their affairs rest with Allah. Not surprisingly, Muhammad's followers have been trying to conquer the world for 14 centuries. In the early centuries of Islam, Muslims fought their way West out of Arabia across northern Africa and into Europe, and they simultaneously fought their way east all the way to India. Islam only stopped advancing militarily when it ran into more powerful groups. Who made it stop advancing? Then the tactics changed. In our time, we're not so much concerned with Muslim armies conquering us. We're concerned with Islamic grooming gangs, drugging, ****** and pimping young girls. We're concerned with forced marriages. We're concerned with the endless terrorist attacks we're concerned with the relentless attempts to replace Western values with Islamic values. We're concerned with Islam's utter contempt for the lives of non Muslims, a contempt that originates in the Koran in Sierra 98 verse six of the Koran allowed declares verily those who disbelieve in the religion of Islam. The Quran and Prophet Mohammed from among the people of the scripture, Jews and Christians and Al Mushrikun those are idolaters, will abide in the fire of hell, they are the worst of creatures. Jews, Christians and other non Muslims are the worst of creatures. We're lower than dogs. We're lower than pigs. That's why jihadis will not hesitate to slaughter us in churches and synagogues, at concerts, at celebrations while working while shopping we are utter garbage in the eyes of Allah. And there are a lot of jihadis who want to remind us of that. What does this have to do with Mohammed cartoons? Well, Muslims after 14 centuries of jihad after terrorist attacks around the world, carried out in the name of your God. After countless thousands of young girls were defiled in every possible way, some Westerners responded to the atrocities. With some cartoons. They didn't respond by going out into the streets and slaughtering Muslims. They didn't respond by putting Muslims into concentration camps. They didn't respond with riots or rape or torture or any kind of violence. They responded with cartoons. Do you have any idea how happy you should be that France is as tolerant as it is? Do you have any idea how happy you should be that the UK is as tolerant as it is? Do you have any idea how happy and thankful you should be that the United States is as tolerant as it is? After 14 centuries of bloodshed, rape, oppression, cruelty, forced conversions, executions, and terrorist attacks, the response to the religion that called for all of this and that calls for our violent subjugation is cartoons. Some Frenchmen responded to violence with nonviolent cartoons. And now you're responding to their nonviolence with more violence. Grow up and realize how good you have it. Show some gratitude to the people who invited you into their countries because your countries were falling apart primarily due to the fact that the legal systems of your previous countries were based on the commands of an illiterate 7th century Arabian caravan, Robert. If the worst thing Westerners are doing to you is making cartoons of the most obvious false prophet in history, you should be rejoicing, not murdering people. There are places in the world that are far, far less tolerant of Islam. But for some reason. You don't seem to care about those places."

Bill Maher's real time recently couple monologues went right after the Liberal establishment and a lot of the rules they've handed down since the beginning. And now we're seeing states Democrat states lifting mandates, despite the fact that Pritzker here in Illinois is clinging out of his mask for dear life. And then we've got CNN. This is really interesting. Their medical expert is now giving a horrifying reason why they believe that mass mandates should end. This is CNN, mind you? OK, so let's get some context here to what is happening before we do. If you're new here, hit the red button down below to subscribe, then tap that notification bell so the first to know when we published new reports. Now, let's analyze what's happening. CNN medical expert recently stated that the masked mandate should end. That normally would be news to celebrate, however, the reason given should actually scare every American Virginia kruta at daily wire reports, CNN medical expert Doctor Leana Wen, who was also. Ahead of Planned Parenthood. Before she went on to be a CNN commentator, she said that it might be time to lift mass mandates because. Well, how are we even allowed to say this? I mean I don't know well she had a reason. Maybe she'll say it in the clip here. Because the threat has passed, but in order to preserve public health, authority to preserve public health, health, authority for when it's needed. Again because people are losing faith. She explained she wasn't saying the idea was good for people to not to stop wearing masks, but that governments needed to ease up and allow people to make decisions for themselves, arguing that people were more likely to accept later restrictions coming from public health authorities if they were first giving back some of their liberty. An autonomy watch start up. You say we can start removing at least some coronavirus restrictions. Now tell us why. Well, I agree with the Colorado with many other local and state jurisdictions that are beginning to lift government mandates, and I think this is the key. I'm not saying that we should be stopping masking, but rather that this needs to shift from a government requirement to an individual decision. The government can't keep on telling our citizens that this is a 5 alarm fire all the time. People are just going to start tuning it out and not pay attention. They'll be desensitized and So what needs to happen is we need to end the state of emergency. And preserve the ability of public health authorities to reinstitute mandates in the future. If we see more and more dangerous variants later. Yeah, I mean she, she's more worried about the authority that they're going to lose in the future because people are not going to listen to them. They're going to tune them out. So let's. Make it about individual decisions. Individual choice before people lose absolute faith and stop listening altogether. I should point out this meme here. I found grand old memes. People are going to be are going to be free to choose to make their own decisions about themselves. That's not a santis, and then the responsibility should shift from a government managed to an individual responsibility CNN. In that interesting well, singing from the same song sheet now. They write that a number of officials have rolled back mass mandates in their states, most notably newly elected Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, Democratic Governor Phil Murphy and John Carney have all announced a plan to remove school masking requirements in a matter of weeks, prompting a response from White House Press Secretary Jin Sakai at Monday's briefing this week. Saki, the chief propagandist at the White House, said that it still recommended that children wear masks in school because that was the most recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But she noted individual schools and localities were at liberty to adopt different policies watch. Check on the mask mandate question in New Jersey in the States and the CDC is still recommending universal masking in schools. That's correct, and that's still remains our recommendation. So are you pleased with the fine with the New Jersey governor's decision? Again, our advice to every school district is to abide by public health guidelines. It continues to be at this point that the CDC is advising that masks can delay reduce transmission. There are also a number of other mitigation measures that we've put in place, but that continues to be. CDC guidance. It's always been up to local school districts to determine how they implement. What does it say then that a governor like Phil Murphy, who's been so closely aligned with the policies of this administration, would get ahead of the medical experts and say, never mind what they say? School districts, you decide. Well, it's always been up to school districts. That's always been our point of view and always been our policy from here and our policy from the federal government is to continue to advise everybody to abide by public health guidelines. Do you think they signaled that? Perhaps the public believes it's time for a change in the federal guidelines? CBC's guide well we certainly understand and have seen in polling that the public is tired of COVID. We understand that. So are we. And there has been some good signs recently where there has been a decrease in hospitalizations around the country. And again we're in constant touch about what it looks like moving forward. But our responsibility as the federal government is to rely on the data and the science that is being analyzed by our public health experts and will continue to rely on that. For what recommendations we're making? So listen to what's being said. Let's give people back a little bit of freedom now so we can ensure the government can oppress all of us later. OK, that mindset should scare all of us. This was the left plan all along. They're openly acknowledging the things they would never say out loud. This is some serious Orwellian stuff. So we think the left is planning next. How afraid should we be? Comment below, we'll see you at the next report for the next news network. I'm Gary Franchi. Thank you for watching that report.

This has to be one of the strangest videos from the border that we've ever seen here. At next news, a human smuggler growls like an animal, like a demon. After being arrested by Border Patrol agents. As bizarre as it seems, there might be a reason for this crazy behavior. Let's dig in, shall we? Christina Leila at the Gateway Pundit reports and a woman arrested for human smuggling and in Carrizo Springs, Texas last week growled at Border Patrol agents as they detained her. It's been reported that the smugglers are coached and told to act crazy if they get arrested so that they can go for an insanity defense watch. OK. What's your feeling?

Get your feedback in there. Get your foot back in there, ma'am, we're gonna have to Taser. You're not gonna like that. Take your feedback in. Bro. We're gonna have to. There is different in the different view. Unbelievable. They report that Border Patrol agents encountered nearly 2,000,000 illegal aliens in 2021. Thanks to Joe Biden's immigration policies quote large smuggling operations are abandoning migrants in dangerous situations at an alarming rate. In fiscal 2021, the Border Patrol rescued 12,877 migrants in the southwest border regions, compared to around 5000 in previous years. Last week, the Border Patrol rescued 25 undocumented migrants who have been left in a locked. Trailer with no way to escape according to the hill. Joe Biden's open border policies are deadly. 55 people died and more than 100 injured after a tractor trailer smuggling migrants from Guatemala, Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Honduras crashed into a bridge and flipped over in December. That truck was smuggling about 250 migrants when it crashed into a bridge in southern Mexico and flipped over last March. An SUV with about two dozen people crammed in it that was involved in a horrific crash with a tractor trailer in Holtville, California, killed over a dozen people. It was part of a cross border smuggling operation, according to sources within Customs and Border Patrol. Now this woman clearly unleashing her demons pretending to be crazy. That's right, but pretending to be crazy to get out of jail is not anything new. The mob used it all the time for their bosses.

While the current year's GDP growth has been projected at 9.2%, among other projections, the services India has fiscal space to wamp up capital expenditure. While challenges remain for the economy. On macro economy, front well for more on this we are joined by wins, business editor. Submit chaturvedi. Thank you very much. Summit for joining us. The Economic Survey for 2021-2022 is expected to give a growth projection of around 9% for the next financial year as Asia third largest economy is showing no signs of recovery from the pandemic. What does that mean for India? Eric. Well, India is currently looking at 3rd wave of COVID-19. Though this wave has not been as damaging as. Other things, but yes, this is one of the biggest challenges Indian economy would face going forward. So as per the economic survey which is the flagship and will document of Government of India that reviews the economic performance and forecast the challenges. It says that Indian economy is very poised to meet any challenges. There is a growth which is happening on Duval side agricultural side in this side and exports are also robust. But there's some challenges that remain and the first of the biggest challenge. One of the biggest challenges is definitely crude. This note is projected is projecting crude between 70 to $75 to a barrel as we speak today. It has reached $90.00 to a barrel. Also, this is maintaining the growth based on monsoon normal monsoon and there will be no further waves or damaging waves of COVID-19. So it's a kind of overall performance of economy which has been given in this economic survey. Today 9% growth over 9% growth. While that's nine point, 2% growth for this current financial year. But it may come down between 8 to 8.5% for the next financial year. So overall that growth has been projected that it challenges have been given. What are the other steps that are needed to be taken? That's also been given and also it's coming a day before the general budget going to be presented by C Chairman, Finance Minister of India tomorrow. It's in a way showing where the economy is going, what steps are needed to be taken and what could be the problem if these steps are not taken while the Minister say it's supply side. Informs complex and exports to be growth drivers for next financial year. Agriculture in the financial year 2022. So a growth of 3.9% and industrial growth was at 11.8%. What other sectors will be India focusing on this financial year? One of the main drivers of growth could be the export sector. Well this is something which clearly India is aiming to go for over the last few years India has started some flagship programs like make in India. Production linked incentive scheme. This is to make India though the overall factory of the world. It has been taken into account that India will be increasing its exports over the next few years. For that steps have been taken. So one of the main growth drivers would be exposed, but that will depend a lot on how the Jubilee tickets politics play over the next few months. Also where the crude goes. Also what are what is the COVID-19 situation but one of the main road drivers are going to be explored. India has taken a number of steps over the last few months when we saw. Chip shortages and there's trying to be a crucial contributor to chip manufacturing in the world. Also supply chain challenges so, so all these have been detailed in this economic survey today. Finally, submit the Union budget like you mentioned, will be presented tomorrow the 1st of February. What can we look out for? Well spoken to a range of policymakers and we're also Indian corporates. They all are of the view that Indian Finance Minister should push the pedal because the economy it needs growth. Well after seeing after witnessing well over the last few quarters the growth has been coming down not just in India but across the world so that the demand size has to be given some kind of. Overall, push for that to take it into account investment, new projects, they have to come over all. There has to be supply side problems. They have to be taken into account as well, but demand side growth is required so investments will be required in the areas of health, health care, agriculture. Infrastructure is a big area as well. Defenseman defense. Well, that has been given a good share over the last few budgets, but this time it's expected to get good cheer as well. Health care is 1 sector and for common man it's always a point of. Interest is what is going to happen in the. The text bracket. Will there be change in tax bracket or not?

Zee News Apps : https://bit.ly/ZeeNewsApps","Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has landed in Dhaka and has been welcomed by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina over the next two days in Bangladesh, the Prime Minister will hold talks with his counterpart that is Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as well as President Abdul Hamid. He will be participating in the Golden Jubilee celebration of Bangladesh's independence and the birth centenary of Bangabandhu, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman. He will attend the National Day program in the second half of the day. So now my question to you is that the Indian Prime Minister has finally arrived in Dhaka. So tell us a little bit about what's on the agenda and take us through his itinerary. Yeah, as a Baghdad genda here in Dhaka, he shot a while ago, arrived here in Dhaka. Welcome by the Prime Minister herself, which is a protocol given by the Bangladeshi Government at the highest level protocol given by the by the Bangladeshi Government. And of course, the airport reverberated with the national anthems of India and Bangladesh, both which have been written by Rabindranath Tagore. But later this day we will see he participating. In the 50th Independence Year celebration of the country, this is a momentous occasion for the country. The see this streets of the country, the capital city, Dhaka, have been lined up with the India flag and Bangladeshi flag. In fact, you can see a poster behind me welcoming the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the city. There have been a whole host of visits of South Asian leaders, but the fact that the Prime Minister of the world's biggest democracy has come here to take part in the Independence Day celebration is something that. Bangladeshis are very happy about very proud about he will of course later inaugurate the Bapu Bangabandhu Digital exhibition. This is something that both the Prime Ministers will be inaugurating together. But above that it shows the commonality between the ideals of the father of the nation of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman and the father of the Nation of India. Mahatma Gandhi. In fact a lot of security as well. You can hear a lot of noise as well but this is. Something that is important in the sense of the high security, which is right now here in the national capital. In fact, all the COVID protocols have also been being being followed, but tomorrow it will be outside where he will go to three places which we all have been talking about. But largely the fact that he's going outside shows that he is reaching out to the common masses. That's now we leave it there and we'll come back to you later in the day for more updates. For now, for more on the Indian Prime Minister, Bangladesh, visit. Joining us live now is jeeper Fossati, the former High Commissioner and former information advisor. The Prime Minister's office. Thanks for joining us Sir. Now the Indian Prime Minister is in Bangladesh on the invitation of his counterpart. Of course she, Cosina to participate in the country's National Day celebrations on March 26th. Tell us a little bit about the significance of this trip. Well, it clearly goes back to the liberation of Bangladesh. From the powerful Pakistani army, I'd be careful in saying it was the Pakistan Army which was responsible for the conditions which created. It was created by the Gen Army president. Yeah, yeah tongue. Now the fact is what has happened after after the independence there has been a period of military rule because of a coup. But what Sheikh Hasina has done. He's brought back the continuance of democracy and a secular democracy at that. You would not from the Prime Minister's program. He is visiting Hindu temples. He's visiting every place which one would expect a Prime Minister of India to go to and therefore it is a country which is very very different from Pakistan. And this is where the real number of the problem you know they have done much better than Pakistan. Economically they were far behind Pakistan when Bangladesh was liberated. And today they are ahead in terms of per capita income. They equal us in terms of economic growth rates. They exceeded us last year and their GDP exceeded us last year. There were of course the pandemic did have an impact on that, but nevertheless something very creditable at a people level. You will find a large number of them in Calcutta doing shopping. They come come in large numbers and most importantly, Indian assistance. Has gone largely towards infrastructure projects which have done them very well and there was one very serious problem which was of the sharing of the Ganga River's waters and that has been sorted out. It took us about 50 years to do it, but we did it. And therefore it's it's a very friendly neighbor. Even cricket is fun they. And they almost have national celebrations when they beat us, so that's that's the fun part of it. But more importantly. Slider cards carefully. She has maintained a cordial correct relationship with China with the West and of course with India and trade is booming. Do you know they have one of the best textile industries and are one of the largest exporters of textile products in the world right now. I think they're doing it so it's a good good neighbor to have right? Absolutely now Mr Parthasarathy. Before the trip, the Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Advisor had sought to ally New Delhi's concerns about Beijing. And shared that his country does not believe in developing the relationship with China at the expense of ties with India. That is its most important neighbor as he said. So tell us more about this. Look when when Bangladesh was founded. China was one of the few countries which backed Pakistani military action against the multi Bonnie and against the Bangladeshis. And therefore it took time for China to make up lost ground. But China does have a capability of delivering the goods economically to fellow developing countries. It has done well on that score. But one thing is very clear. I mean and it is not. It's one place where we don't worry of the Chinese presence. Because we know the ruler can keep it under control and is not going to do anything to harm our interests. What is very important, I think to bear in mind is to have this common system of you know. Respect for values and despite being an Islamic country, the fact of the matter is that the Bangladeshis allow the Hindu. Temples to drive or you have a small Christian population. Therefore it is secular as you would have seen. I think the Prime Minister is visiting to temples when he's there, which are highly respected. Yes, we've had some problems with regard to the flow of refugees from Bangladesh into Assam. Perhaps we could also have been slightly more tactful in how we articulated it. But nevertheless, that's behind us. And we're looking ahead and I'm sure there will be a spate of new agreements to strengthen the economic partnership. One last point, Bangladesh, since Sock has not functioned thanks to the Pakistanis, we now have bimstec, which is all our eastern neighbors going up to Thailand and that is doing pretty well. And in fact I was at attended a meeting of army chiefs from the Bimstec countries who come to India. We are reaching Pune and. Therefore, the relationship between the army is good there. They're having a bit of a Rohingya problem with not paper to serious Rohingya problem with Myanmar. And we're doing our best along with Japan to sort it out right? My final questions are now this visit of course, comes amid the run up to the West Bengal and Assam Assembly poll. So both states will keenly follow the developments over the next two days during this visit. So give us your thoughts on the same. Well, I I would. I would think that the the this visit is really geared to the relationship with Bangladesh. But I can assure you one thing Bangladesh is follow political developments with their brother in Bengali brothers in. West Bengal very seriously, so they will be having a good look at it. But I think what is important here is in foreign affairs. It is good to have a bipartisan relationship. By and large, I think people from all political parties observe this, and especially in the case of Sheikh Hasina, she has good relations with all political parties in India and that that helps out. So I think it is beyond the. Realm of domestic politics in India alright Mr Patty, thank you so much for joining us on rheannon. Thank you for all your insights.

Now the Congress LED opposition had called the Bills anti farmer. The two farm bills were passed in Rajya Sabha amid raucous and protests by the opposition. The farm bills were passed by voice vote in the upper house making it last in the Indian constitution. Although the opposition which lacked enough numbers to block it, has demanded that the bill needs to be sent to a Select Committee for review. The opposition created huge ruckus and rushed to the well of the house, protesting against the bills. Voice vote took place when the house resumed after a 10 minute adjournment amid the uproar by the opposition earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended the three legislations passed in the parliament to modernize the Indian agrarian sector. Prime Minister Modi said that the bills have been passed to empower the farmers so that they can sell their produce in any part of the country. The BJP was attacked by opposition for attempting to dismantle the old structure of procurement through legislations. Now the BJP in India is not the first party to move ahead with the new procurement system. Congress, a leading opposition party, had promised dismantling of the current system in its manifesto. During the Lok Sabha election in 2019, the current bill is intended to do away with the middle men. India agrarian sector remains unreformed because of intense politicization of the farming community with the abolition of the APMC Act, farmers in India will be able to self produce in any part of the country the bill. Also incentivizes participation of the private sector. The idea is to cut the middleman between seller and the buyer. Many states in India do not have the APMC Act, but still have done very well in protecting the interests of the farmers Prime Minister also said that minimum support price will not be done away with and people should not give in to fake news.

The country's top court. Said that, people's privacy must be protected in view of allegations that users data is being shared with companies. Both WhatsApp and Facebook refuted these allegations and told the Supreme Court that the same privacy policies applicable to other countries except the European Union nations where they have their own special data protection law. Now this is not the first time that WhatsApp has been pulled up in India. They remember in a strongly worded letter to WhatsApp. CEO will Katkat India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology earlier expressed its strong concerns on Whatsapp's new privacy changes and asked instant messaging app to respect the. Security of Indian users. Now Indian IIT Ministry in that letter had asked WhatsApp to withdraw the proposed policy slamming it's all or nothing approach. So what is this policy all about now? This is a data sharing policy between WhatsApp and Facebook and it has been one of the key aspects of the concern. The Indian Government letter said that the new proposed policy seizes any meaningful distinction between WhatsApp and Facebook companies. And given the huge user base of both the companies in India, consolidation of this sensitive information exposes a quote very large segment of Indian citizens to greater security risk and vulnerabilities creating a. Honey pot of information UN quote. Under such pressures, WhatsApp recently halted the rollout of this controversial privacy policy and now the Supreme Court of India has also demanded an answer from WhatsApp and Facebook. Now India, the Indian government had also raised strong objections against differential treatment by WhatsApp to its users in India and in European Union. While the new proposed WhatsApp policy was only for India, they remained unchanged. For Europe, the letter also said the Indian Government letter earlier written to WhatsApp also said quote differential treatment is prejudicial to the interests of Indian users, UN quote and viewed with serious concerns by the government.

And that famous man. Was me So what we're going to do tonight is tell you where Jesse Watters Primetime's going, but before we do that, let's talk about where we are now. American people have run out of patience and we're tired of being dis respected, ignorant, greedy leaders sold out our factories and pride to the Chinese communists for unpatriotic profits deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Shamefully, mismanaged took a physical and mental toll. We were over saturated with highly addictive painkillers, while Wall Street blew up the economy and escaped with golden parachutes instead of prison stripes. Sick cyber warriors. Invited us by race to distract us from the real division class as we erupted and tried to fix all this. A steady diet of hopes is in hatred was forced down our throats. The left romanticized rage and resistance for four straight years. But now they want to cancel you for just daring to disagree. And just as we came up for air, a sketchy virus slipped out of the very country. We arrogantly misjudged 2 decades ago when we brought them into the WTO. Then they locked us down, shut it, our businesses and closed our schools. Well, they bought the dip and capitalized on the new normal. The permanent pandemic power grab. And after everything turns out we were right from the very beginning, weren't we? Am I being too dramatic, probably. But do I know what I'm talking about? Of course I do. The American people have been dis respected for far too long, and that stops tonight. We'll be exposing the scoundrel, celebrating the Patriots and making sure we're respected whenever some snobar idiot disrespects us will confront them and tell him what's up. And they better start listening. They can't pretend like they don't hear us anymore. The same goes for all the crooked politicians out there. We're in a Republic and we give our representatives power to represent us, not themselves. Every night will remind him they work for us. Am I taking myself too seriously? Maybe, but we'll figure it out. Bottom line, the country screaming out, listen to us and we will. Here's one way how, as most of you know, my mom's always texting me to tell me how she feels. But that's not fair, especially for me because she's such a big lip. So we're going to try something new. I'm going to give out my phone number so you can text me too. It'll always be right there at the bottom of your screen. Make sure to include your name, city, and state. If you're old fashioned, email water is at fox.com. Remember name, City and state. Jesse Watters has always always been about connecting with the people and telling it straight. In fact, I did that earlier right here in New York City. New show launching Jesse Watters primetime. You excited. Yes, I am. Have you ever heard of Jesse Watters? Prime time? No, no, I haven't. Do you know who Jesse Watters is? No, I'm waters you, Jesse Watters yeah. Jesse Watters primetime drops Monday at 7. That's amazing. I love 7:00 o'clock. I'm pumped up my moral good and ready, Jesse, what he's the man right here? Oh God, dude, every time I see you, it just hurts my brain. The fact that you exist, it's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts. What do you watch at 7:00 o'clock right now? Bad woman? I'm not going to be wearing any leather. That's the point. Reality so news? Well, you're in luck. 'cause that's what I do. What kind of news do you watch? CNN Fake News CNN is fake news. Don't talk to me. On Jesse Watters primetime, what news topics do you want to see me cover anything that's actually real? Time now for some real news of the week. Safety in New York and immigration the filibuster World Peace man. What topics in the news would you like to see me cover odors in the air and people don't like that? You smell that. What is that? What what is new on me? I'm only crying variant. Did you get Omicron? Yeah, did you? Yeah? What were your symptoms? I haven't experienced any type of symptoms, thankfully I got. Bills are good. I'm very concerned about the casinos because I don't want the graduates to go and take their graduation money and go to the casinos right away. Rain Man yeah, let's play some cuts which guests would you like to see me have on Ron DeSantis judge? Jeanine Kyle Rittenhouse. Kevin Hart me. I'll go on pick me choose me. Love me should I interview AOC? Yes, interview her 'cause it's like where's? Where is she in the city? What is she doing for the city she like? She like laughed? It's like she make me my drink then. Cheers. Try interview Joe Biden. Sure, why not? How is he doing? I would imagine he's doing lovely. You have a great imagination. Anyone you want to say hi to at Fox right now?

Tom Waters waters, John Waters and this is my world. This is your world hi world can I pop your bubble? I love that yeah, here you go. So we'll keep connecting to the country on the streets, on TV. And yeah, you can text me. Primetime will represent the people and respect the people. For example, we sent producers to Joe Biden's hometown, Scranton, PA, to ask if the President has been true to his Scranton roots. Let's just say he's not the hometown hero, the media told you. He was just know this. We have a sense of purpose and a sense of humor. Now, one says the news has to be boring, and I promise this show. Will not be boring. So rod with prime time will take the trip together and not the kind of trip Gutfeld is thinking about. But if that's your thing, fine. I have a good feeling where this is all going and you already know by this point I've never been wrong. I'm also predicting Aaron Rodgers is gonna win MVP at championship. No, he's gonna win the Super Bowl. OK, so maybe I was wrong once. Very rare. Just don't tell me you don't feel what's happening. Something rising up from the bottom. Parents have been activated while workers have begun bargaining for a better lifestyle. People voting with their feet fleeing from blue to red states, day traders and social media stars making a fortune or a name for themselves outside the confines of corporate America. Hispanic Americans swerving into the Republican Party, black Americans questioning the Democrat monopoly on their vote, the rise of independence. All of us sick of being manipulated for money. Censored for political power and abused by partisan prosecutors. So stick with me for one reason. Because I love you. This is a love story and unlike Biden, I actually will outperform expectations.

The president hasn't had a week like this since his disgraceful and deadly retreat from Kabul. He saw his entire agenda fall apart in real time these past seven days and even someone is out of it as Sleepy Joe has to realize things are getting bad on Monday. the US shattered records with over 1.3 million COVID cases. In a single day, for the guy who promised America, he would shut down the virus. It seems like he's doing the exact opposite. So Biden week started off well for one on Tuesday. Things only got worse for the embattled President Biden went down to Georgia to attack the filibuster. I believe the threat to our democracy is so grave. That we must find a way to pass these voting rights. Bill we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this. Biden speech caught flak from both sides of the aisle as he trashed Senate rules and looked to smear any American who cares about election integrity as a racist. So if you're keeping score at home, that's oh and two for Biden this week. And if you thought things were getting getting any better as the week moved on, think again. On Wednesday, the Labor Department announced the Consumer Price Index jumped 7% in December, the worst since 1982 thanks to Biden. Pork anomic policies prices. Are the highest they've been in 40 years. Now you know how your wallet's been feeling a little light lately. Well, you can thank Joe Biden for that, and the pain didn't stop there as the release of a new poll highlighted Biden's fall from grace. His job performance rating hit a new low with only 33% of Americans saying they approve of Biden and more than 50% disapproving. And that was only Wednesday. Which brings us here to yesterday where it was a Thursday to forget for this administration, Kamala Harris didn't do her boss any favors when she sat down for a one on one with NBC. She got tripped up on what should have been a pretty obvious question. It sounded like a beauty pageant contestant who would? Who's thrown a curveball in an interview? At what point does the administration say you know what the strategy isn't working? We're gonna change strategies, is it Tom? It is time for us to do what we have been doing in that time is every day. Every day it is time for us to agree that there are things and tools that are available to us to slow this thing down. But this train wreck of an interview by his second in command just continued. Biden's no good, terrible Thursday Joes vaccine mandate on private businesses, which would have affected more than 80 million Americans, was shot down by the Supreme Court, the nation's highest court told Biden that our personal freedoms outweighed his executive overreach. So as Thursday came to a close, Biden was looking at an over four week and this morning there was no reprieve. As the pain continued for Joe Biden was forced to admit that he hasn't done a whole lot as president. There's a lot of talk about. Disappointments and things. We haven't gotten done. We're gonna get a lot of them done, I might add. That's pretty rich, Joe. He admits he hasn't done anything to help the people who elected him but then slips into a. I don't worry, we'll get it done. Unfortunately, we don't believe you, Joe. And things are getting so bad for Biden that even his trusty leftist media has turned on him. President Joe Biden has had a very tough week with setbacks for his agenda. Every time I think the White House thought they've hit bottom, there seems to be a new bottom. The overall sentiment, not just among the American public, but even among Democrats in Washington. People who are allies of this administration is that this is a really bad period for the Biden administration. The Biden administration continues to fail every step of the way, and even the left can't hide it anymore. So here's the important question, what is the White House going to do about it? Well, it doesn't look like they have a plan at all. If anything, their frustration is reaching critical levels. You do hard things in white houses. You have every challenge at your at your feet laid at your feet, whether it's global or domestically. And we could certainly propose legislation to see if people. Support Bunny rabbits and ice cream. But that wouldn't be very rewarding to the American people. Bunny, rabbits and ice cream. That's what the White House has come to. Well, it's so clear that they are in over their heads. They can't handle the crisis that they're currently facing. So what happens when a new crisis arrives? Like the mother of all supply chain problems that is emerging right now in China? We're still feeling the pain from our current supply chain crisis and another supply bubble is ready to burst. Kanamits are warning that if COVID continues to spread across Asia, the disruption to manufacturing could be. Catastrophic, as we're too reliant on China to make the things that we need. It's been a very bad week for Joe Biden. Probably the worst seven days of his presidency. He saw America's institutions and people reject everything. He campaigned on nearly one year after his inauguration. Joe Biden Presidency has hit a breaking point. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","Now, Johnny Joey Jones, as you know him well is a retired U.S. Marine and we're very proud to have him as a Fox News contributor. You've been with us a great deal. Your perspective has been key and fundamental. After what you've just heard from the Secretary of State. What are your feelings tonight? Yeah, first I wanna start by saying I'm my thoughts and prayers and my love and and supporting everything you need is with the families of 13 heroes. We lost them. I'm easy to find if any of those families need anything from me, please let me know. I'm there to help you in any way I can in the organization that I support. Or no, we're here for you. Secondly, I'd like to say to the thousands of people that fled Afghanistan because you helped us and you believed in us. We're here to welcome you and anything I can do for you. Please let me know. And lastly, I'll say for every single veteran out there and Gold Star family who bled. And said pounds of flesh like I did for this war. I love you and I appreciate you. I can't tell you tonight that your service and sacrifice meant what you thought it did. When you, when you were there. I, I can't tell you tonight that it meant that our country would be safer. I can't tell you tonight that it meant we would search down and kill the people that tried to kill us. 'cause I just don't know if that mission is accomplished. But what I can tell you is every single one of us that bled and and now they took some fainting breaths or even last breaths there. We did it because we knew the people to our left and right would do it for us. And if that's what it took, if it took us dying so they would go home, then by God that was worth it. So when everyone out there to understand that's what it was worth it. I don't know if the mission laid out by our leaders and our government was accomplished or even full heartedly attempted to be accomplished. I just don't know that I don't trust politicians and I don't trust this type of diplomacy any further than I can throw it in a gal with no legs. Can't throw real far. But I will tell you, I believe in the men and women I served with. I believe in the in the pureness of our intent and when the Secretary of State stands up there and tells me that the people who killed my brothers and took my legs can earn our trust. Yeah well thank God this is television news and not just a casual conversation 'cause I'd have words for him. Nobody wants to hear. Well I think I'm. I also know some pretty harsh words which we we both are gonna keep to ourselves. I can tell you Sir, this is though a reminder that leadership matters, doesn't it? You know that is a military man. We know that in life this is. Leadership matters. We know this is not a reflection of this country or of our military, or of the American people, and that is what is so shocking that we are willing to make sacrifices. You you did so, and everyone else is willing to this was shocking. Is none of this had to happen. This was not a natural end to what this we all wanted to be out of there, but not like running away to to cut are not running away. And then and gaslighting the American people about what is or is not happening. Let alone abandoning, we abandoned people from four with an arbitrary deadline. Is that how do we? How do we? How do we process that? What do you say to people? I just hope the American people understand something that's really special about this country. Blood is the easiest currency to acquire. We offer it up freely. We volunteer to serve this military and I don't know many that volunteered in the last 20 years. That didn't beg to go into deployment. You can get blood really easy, but the interest on that payment, the interest on that currency lasts a lifetime. Yeah, 'cause those are broken hearts that that that ripple throughout this country. And so the next time a politician stands at that bully pulpit and promises you. Something like a war. Ask questions and have consequences at the ballot box 'cause we know now. Regardless of party, we can't trust them. And before we send our sons and daughters, we need to know why and where they're going and how they're going to get back. This is completely at clearly nonpartisan. I'm a partisan for America. You are as well. This is about the human condition and and what the greatest country on Earth in which we wake up in every single day. Thank God is capable of doing Joey. I want you to listen to something from General McKenzie. With CENTCOM giving praise to the Taliban, listen to this. The Taliban have been very pregnant, very pragmatic and very businesslike as we have approached this withdrawal. They were actually very helpful and useful to us as we closed down operations. Absolutely standing. These are people who also are. Still there's one family, at least out there, begging Joe Biden to get an American back. Who's who was kidnapped by the Taliban over a year ago. They're still holding Americans. What do you make of a man in uniform who makes a statement like that about the enemy? That's that you can say on television stuff. Yeah, that's tough. I I don't know that man, I didn't. As far as I know, I didn't serve under his command. I don't know what political pressure on his shoulders. But I know what it means to be a marine. I know what it means to bleed with men and women and to hold their hand when they're taking their last breath, and to do everything I can. Everything in me if it means walking down and leaning over a bomb and taking a damn good guess to keep them alive, even if that means I get blown into pieces. That's OK, and I'll tell you right now, I'd never look them in the face, even if the President United States who was my boss at the time, told me to, and say some trash like that about the people trying to kill him. You can say that you are proud of this mission. We just accomplished as far as airlifting 100,000 people out of a country that's about to go to ruin, but to go so far as to be a spin doctor for an organization that literally tortures people, oppresses them, and kills them. How dare you and how dare you ever ever look troops in the face again and order them into combat? You don't deserve it. You just don't get to do that. You don't get to play both sides of the ball when you put that uniform on. Can you ask our 18 to 19 year olds to go bleed and die for this country even if we're smart enough to know it's a 'cause? That doesn't mean anything to you and I I don't mean the general, but to our politicians he even if we're smart enough to understand the politics behind it, we raise our right hand and we do it because we do it with honor and we do it because we love this country and we do it because even if it's some partisan war, if it can keep our enemy at Bay for one more day, that's worth it. And how dare you think that you can lead troops and stand up there and speak glowingly about the people who have tried to kill us for 20 years? How just how dare you do that. It is shocking. Listen with if you want to withdraw and and botch it, turn it into an evacuation, sure, and spin on that. That's OK. Listen. I am proud of the men and women that got everyone out of there. But to go so far as to brag on the Taliban. That's just it's. It's betrayal is what it is. It is. And if there is a point where you have to do that. Or you could resign in protest where there is this understanding about what is appropriate, what decency really is. It's hard enough with. Everyone who served you and your brothers and sisters now watching this collapse, but then to praise the people as they stood there and aided Al Qaeda and aided bin Laden as the as we are just within a couple of weeks of the anniversary of September 11th. It is remarkable. It is also, Sir, I think you would agree with me unacceptable. God bless you Joey. It is an honor to be even remotely associated with you keep up the great work. I know. Of course prayers for you and for everyone. It is difficult, but we're strong people. We know there needs to be some changes and you're in the forefront of reminding us why. Thank you, Sir. Thank you and don't forget about those still recovering from that bomb that they didn't weren't killed by it. We need to pray for them. Yes, we've got a lot of a few of our troops I know have already been transferred here to the United States. Families are asking for prayers for the seriously injured and that must be on our forefront of our minds as well. Thank you Joey. Hey Sean Hannity here.

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","Back to our top story. Now the House Select Committee Speaker Nancy Pelosi picked to investigate the January 6th Riot on Capitol Hill, held its first official hearing today. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy head picked several Republican lawmakers, 5 in fact to get a spot in the committee, but the House Speaker rejected two of them, prompting the Minority Leader to pull the rest of his picks that included Illinois Congressman Rodney Davis, who joins us now. I'm sure you're plugged into the hearing today. What did you think of it? You know it was just tragic to hear the stories again from my friend like Harry done about the hell that those officers went through on January 6th. I would certainly looking forward to being a part of this Select Committee, but the speaker decided in an unprecedented way to to kick off my colleagues Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, which hasn't been done, not just a Select Committee. It hasn't been done in Congress on any committee before you mentioned Harry done there, who of course was the officer that we saw. And there's the five members by the way. Who were picked to be on this committee by Congressman McCarthy? But then they were pulled after congressman Banks and Jordan were excluded. By Nancy Pelosi. Harry Dunn, who of course is the police officer that we saw trying to walk the insurrectionists through the stairway of the Capitol building there trying to keep them away from the chambers, he said in the closing that people say that this was a that this is the Select Committee, a political exercise. But he said January 6th was political and he also said. It shouldn't be that hard to tell the truth. You pointed out. Harry Dunn is a friend of yours. I've seen pictures of the two of you embracing each other in in past occasions. Actually, you know we do have the sound, so let me play that for you. Come right back to Congress. Is it in the sentiment that's going around that says everybody trying to make January 6 political? Well, it's not a secret that. It was political. They literally were there to stop the steal. So when people say it shouldn't be political, it is, it was and it is. There's no getting around that as you mentioned just a second ago, congressman, you count him as a friend. I've seen pictures of the two of you embracing in the halls of Capitol Hill. Yet in some circles he's painted as a left wing activist. What do you say about that? Well, I just wish people would get to know Harry, like I know him on that evening, after I was able to go back to the Capitol immediately after the break in. Immediately after the riots, one of the first people I saw in the Capitol Rotunda. It was my good friend Harry and we embraced and he told me the stories that he mentioned today. But my goal in my charge here in this in this Congress is the ranking member on House administration which has jurisdiction over the Capitol police and what I wanted my role to be on this committee was to make sure that Harry Dunn and the brave Capitol police officers that saved my life on a baseball field and my friends just a few years ago should never have been put into this position in the 1st place. We need to. Ask why the security posture was not there and that shouldn't be political, and it's something that I've been asking since January 6th and frankly, even before, yeah, we had Congressman bank sign at the top of the show. I don't know if you saw that or not, but that's a question that he has posited is if we knew that this was coming or something was coming. At least based on intelligence that we know the FBI had. Why weren't Capitol Hill police? Why wasn't the National Guard? Why weren't political leaders more prepared for the possibility that something like this could happen? It was the worst case scenario of errors that kind of were compacted into one giant problem that I think any of us could have could have wondered would have happened in the past and to be honest with you, when you look at the preparation, I got a briefing the day before and there was nothing that would have led me to believe that we would have encountered what we saw that day and then to top it off. Now we've had the Inspector General of the Capitol Police give Flash reports that said there was not enough training. There was not enough equipment. Our officers were not put in a position to succeed and to top it off, intelligence was given to our Capitol police and to the Capitol Police Board, which is made up of political appointees that frankly, I think your viewers should know make all of the decisions around here at the Capitol. They were the ones who worried about optics. They were the ones that Capitol Police Board that handed Speaker Pelosi a note at 1:43 PM on January 6th, asking if she believes they should call the National Guard. These are questions shouldn't have been asked today, John. They should be asking future hearings and I certainly hope the committee members that remained ask them what what about the issue? Congressman Davis of incitement and whether or not the President speech the morning of January the 6th, played into this at all? I expect that that is going to come up. Do you believe that there was that this crowd was incited to do what it did? Listen, of course it's going to come up. Of course, the speaker has decided to put together a committee that's that's 8 Democrats and now two others that were were appointed by Speaker Pelosi. Those of us that were going to make up to five Republican appointments. We were ready to to soberly and very effectively ask the questions as to what failed before January 6th. And unfortunately, I don't think we're going to get them to answer. Ask those questions because. The chairman of this Select Committee has said the only questions off limits are speaker Pelosi. Related questions, right? It's wrong. It's not going to help Harry in the rest of the folks. I'm pretty much out of time, congressman, but I just wanna ask you very quickly about what you just said. There you said 8 Democrats and two others, Congressman Kinzinger and Cheney are members of the Republican caucus. Yet you refer to them as others. Why is that? Well, they did what I wouldn't do. They accepted appointments from Speaker Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi knew what she was doing. We had a chance at a bipartisan Commission. I wrote a bipartisan Commission bill in January that every Republican voted for as part of a previous question. There was some disagreement as we moved forward a month later on a bipartisan deal because Speaker Pelosi was asked to change the scope and address some staffing issues. She didn't do that. Which is why she put this partisan committee together. She knew what she was doing. It's not a coincidence. And it's the way that she can get Democrats not to ask the questions that need to be asked as to why she was handed. That note Congressman Rodney Davis to the great state of Illinois. Thank you for your time Sir. Appreciate it. Thank you John. Thank you so Sandra. Clearly there is some ill will there between other members of the Republican Conference and Congressman Kinzinger and Congresswoman Liz Cheney."

With respect to Saudi Arabia, but I think we're doing very well question. Federal mediation is always possible if that's what they want. Hopefully they'll be able to work out the GM strike quickly. We don't want General Motors building plants outside of this country. And we're very strong on that. The UAW has been very good to me. The members have been very good from the standpoint of voting. The relationship is good. Hopefully they're gonna work that out quickly and solidly. Now I just gave a pretty big news conference inside and we're going to be late for New Mexico. We can't do that. Ever to New Mexico, so go ahead, David. I think we're the same. I think we just want to find out the final numbers and see. You look at a vector and you look at. There are lots of different things we can look at David and we'll know for certain over the next pretty short period of time. Well then we're going to decide we're going to. Say it again louder. Would this be proportionate? Is that what you're asking? I would say yes. I would say so. I don't know who's going to New Mexico with me, but I'll see you on the plane. Can I watch? Well, I think so. Look, they want to find out also and I think they probably feel they know. But we're going to know very, very quickly. We have pretty much all the material we need. We'll know very quickly. I think the New York Times made another terrible mistake. It's it's a shame. Nothing like that could happen. I see they're making a big correction today. They've just announced as a correction. But to do that about a Supreme Court Justice is a terrible thing. It's a. False accusation. Whatever happened with the New York Times? I mean, I could tell you personally they never checked. They never do. We used to have a thing called fact checking. They don't do fact checking anymore. They used to call and say what about this? What about that? How can they do a thing like that and destroy somebody's life? I mean, they're destroying lives. And it's fake news. It's just fake news, but it's a very fair question. I mean, they have to be very embarrassed, but much more importantly what they do is wrong. And they do it all the time. Well, we have the strategic. If you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody. Now we have more than anybody else with the number one energy producer in the world, which took place very recently and we will soon be substantially more than anybody else. So it won't affect us. And ultimately I don't think it'll affect the world. But it won't affect the United States. I don't think so, no. I think it's going to be fun. We're going to see some of the African leaders at the UN, yes. So I'll see Prime Minister Modi and I will will be meeting with India and Pakistan. And I think a lot of progress has been made there. A lot of progress. Thank you. We got from The New Yorker. I don't know anything about it."

#ABCNL #Prime #Poland #Refugees","Just imagine if you had to leave everything you own behind to start an entirely new life in a new country. That is the reality for so many Ukrainians. Now trying to get back on their feet in Poland, the government, the Polish people and many organizations are doing everything they can to help as refugees now attempt to settle in for the long haul. Our Victor Kendo has been traveling across Poland and brings us this in depth report. They've been waiting for hours. Thousands of people now in a foreign land with an uncertain future not to see a football match at Warsaw National Stadium, but for a chance to score a Social Security number that will pave the way for a new life in a new country. Tonight the Polish Government and people rolling out the welcome mat for millions of Ukrainians escaping the war torn country. Of the more than 3,000,000 who have left Ukraine so far, 2/3 have come to Poland. The population in Poland, capital increasing by a staggering 20% in less than three weeks. Pankiw explaining how they have no home to go back to in Lviv, I lost my job and lost my apartment because other refugees living there already. So we are looking for any possibilities to like to understand what we standing on. She's one of many taking advantage of a new UN program now underway in Warsaw. To distribute money to refugees, summer sleeping in the rough and they really need help. So we hope that this cash assistance acts as a bridge to get them on their feet. The need so great here we met Ilya from Keith, he's been sleeping on the floor of a Warsaw train station with his grandmother, Mom and sister waiting to find a more permanent roof over their heads. She's going in here, but. Russian, Timur and Olga, arriving from Kharkiv with their family, travelling six days before making it to Warsaw, a line of buses waiting to take them and countless others to a help center. Platform there don't have friends in voice. Everything is gone. Officials, now urging Ukrainians to make their way to more rural areas and smaller towns where more resources may be available. At the moment they are focused on the biggest cities because they think that this is like the the the main change for them. But in the smaller cities there is also eight. There's also help. There are also people willing to help in this town of 16,000 people. They've welcomed 600. Refugees, well, there's no way as a dad I can look at moms with kids, right? And not cry and think what can we do? Andrew Edels offering his spare cottage to 14 year old 11 family Eleva pictured here with his younger sister, mother and grandmother last May. Fleeing car key along with his cousin after spending days inside this bomb shelter with their dog. Way better. First of all, no explosions so you feel safer here. I feel way safer here only 40 minutes outside Warsaw, the town of Milanovich, a community opening their doors to the most in need. And to be clear you've never met before, right? Fax machine is not. They've never met this mother and son fleeing Ukraine with all they could carry. Now relying on strangers for shelter. This local Polish woman taking them to stay with her mother across town. And they are the lucky ones. Poles now creating makeshift shelters in any empty space they can find here inside of a shuttered mall which was set to be demolished. But the owner decided to delay that and convert it into a Health Center. So now empty stores are lined with cots for refugees. There are also bathrooms. And showers providing a temporary solution until they find a more permanent place to live. This Polish theater becoming a temporary home. A mother of five telling us they had to cover her windows with blankets to muffle the sound of sirens back home. Her children calling that the siren monster, the mayor of Warsaw, now asking NATO allies to do more. We need a system, a system in Europe and in the world to relocate refugees because we cannot do it alone. What I'm asking all of my friends in the Western world help us out and let's do it in a way which is well planned. Enough of improvisation organizations offering. Free plane and train tickets to other parts of Europe to help ease the burden. Crowds continue to swarm Krakow's Ukrainian consulate. This line, stretching for blocks in both directions to replace lost documents and passports outside that national Stadium in Warsaw. Thousands lining up to apply for their new Polish ID numbers equivalent to Social Security numbers called a pestle. Why was it so important to get that pestle number? I need vessel for many things. I need work for money for bank account for staying here. In Poland, until the warrant 2600, pencil numbers assigned in two days at the stadium alone, more than 120,000 throughout Poland and counting, they grant access to legally find work life for a mortgage, send children to school and receive monthly public transportation passes inside the stadium, refugees bring their documents, fill out the paperwork, take new photos and, if approved, walk away with their new numbers. Within hours we have about 100 stalls here for now. The maximum number of people that can be processed one days about 1002. Well, Lena registering her son Odd for his new ID number still in disarray like so many others, she's now planning their new future in Poland. Hi everyone, George Stephanopoulos here.

#ABCNL #Ukraine #Adoption #LeftInLimbo","Imagine anxiously awaiting getting to meet your new child after they've found their forever family and then waking up to the news that the country you're adopting them from is under attack. That's exactly the nightmare. The dozens of families in the US are facing as their adoption cases find themselves in limbo due to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. ABC's Matt Gutman brings us this story of two families and what some orphanages in Ukraine are doing to keep some of the most vulnerable as safe and protected as possible. Right now they're driving me. Pain after bombing. A harrowing journey out of a country gripped by war. We had many conversations about what was happening and. You know if it was the right decision to go or to stay on February 22nd, Quayson Juniper, who were both born in Ukraine with special needs, were officially adopted into the Wittbrodt family. It was. Like kind of like we we did it. We made it. We got him out like we're going to be OK. Less than 36 hours later, Russian tanks rolled across the border and Russian bombs started shattering the peace. And this family, from Wyoming, and those kids were thrust into the biggest armed conflict in Europe since World War Two when we woke up to that concussion. Like that in the ways that. Like you felt it, you heard it and then it's like you heard it again. And then you heard it and you're like Oh my God like something, it's really happening. They believed they were the last parents to sign adoption paperwork out of Ukraine. Just a few hours later clutching their kids, they joined what would soon be a deluge of nearly 3,000,000 refugees navigating an unpredictable warzone to safety. Once the bombings had happened, we still didn't have their passports, so they couldn't have left, and so, like a miracle happened and we were able to get them, they are some of the lucky ones prior to the invasion just within our agency, we were working with about 45 families who were hoping to adopt from Ukraine, and they had identified 81 children that they hope to bring home. There's just so much unknown at this point. Caius and Juniper are among the fortunate orphans able not only to find their forever families, but also to make it out of Ukraine. Majority of the orphans still there with no current prospect for adoption. The war has reportedly uprooted 10s of thousands of orphans from state run institutions in frontline cities. This orphanage in Lviv in western Ukraine had 20 orphans before the war. Now there are 100 and five children here, mostly from frontline cities. We visited another orphanage in Lviv. Despite the affection and the nourishing meals, there are nightly reminders of the war. At this orphanage they're trying to give these kids some enrichment. They don't know what war is. We're told here, but they know that something is wrong. They know they're not where they used to be. You can feel the tension. Volunteers are there daily helping with the transition and the trauma. Memories, and that's OK, but I can make them and I can make good memories for what I try to do with trying to give them good memories. What do they need most? Pink just time spending like being with them is the most important. The Ukrainian government has frozen all adoptions, thousands of orphans were valuated to European cities, but now the government is trying to keep many of them inside Ukraine to minimize the trauma. It's just trauma on top of trauma on top of trauma, so one of our goals is if we can figure out a way to keep them here. We reduce the amount of trauma that we're inflicting on the kids. Sherry Mcclurg is a clinical psychologist who specializes in adoptions from Ukraine. But these kids must be feeling and experiencing. It's gotta be so overwhelming right now and we just need to keep them all together. Spending time is something Shannon and Anthony Estes dream about in Illinois when we first met him, he literally leapt in the arms of my wife. And, you know, he was full of tears. And then when we first got into the car, he was pointing out a receipt saying, Mama and Papa and just immediately fell in love with the kid robot, seen here singing in the car. The Estes asked. We blur his face for safety reasons. They hosted the seven year old this winter and as they were waiting for adoption papers to be filed, Russia invaded Ukraine, upending their plans. Also. We didn't think anything was going to happen when I heard Russia started to invade Ukraine, so of course that struck fear in me. I had to get on my phone and look at all the research and I started to freak out like now what's going to happen? We have no way to reach him. We don't know what's going to happen to him, but during our interview telling us. Their latest news. We actually just found out his orphanage crossed into a safe country. Yep, just just this afternoon. But yes, admit they've been fortunate. Many other families continue to wait with no end insight after Ukraine put that moratorium on adoptions. Once again, and be able to hold him and kiss him goodnight and tell him I love him. Hi my name. More time. Absolutely make my day they're worried, but hopeful there will be a day that can all meet again. It doesn't take blood to make you a family member. It's doesn't even take the same language, the same culture to be a family member. Back in Wyoming. A sweet homecoming. All the world coming Chiasson juniper are safe from war now a part of a loving family. Back in Ukraine, the many thousands of orphans uprooted by this war are busy clinging to a semblance of childhood, squealing with laughter on the merry go round, playing pattycake zoning out to paw patrol. And as often as they can. Being loved, I always say that. Kids learning families. That's just how it is. I love you. We think we won the lottery with these two kids. So many tentacles to this war thanks to Mac up and for that hi everyone. George Stephanopoulos here. Thanks for checking out the ABC News YouTube channel.

#ABCNLPrime #GoldStarFamilies #Veterans #Trauma #Afghanistan #Taliban","With Afghanistan descending and into chaos, some veterans who served there, and families whose loved ones never made it home, are now struggling to cope with these recent events. Here's ABC's chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz. This is Kylie Willis. She lives in a small town in West Virginia, only a few hours drive from the nation's capital. I believe this one says Purple Heart. I believe this one is because he served in Afghanistan. Kindly is a member of one of the 2448 Gold Star families who lost relatives in Afghanistan. They are now reeling from the rapid collapse of the Afghan government and the reestablishment of the Taliban. The main question is why? Why did I send my loved one to die for this country? If things just went back to the same. That question a recurring theme this week. Haunting Gold Star families, and it may be triggering a mental health crisis among our veterans. You know, losing my dad was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Kylie was 15 years old when she lost her father in Afghanistan. Her father, staff Sergeant Kirk Owens, was driving a notoriously dangerous Rd in 2011 when he was struck and killed by an IED along with two other members of his unit. In the Paktia province and area that was seeing increasing violence and fighting, he took the front seat in the front car because he knew it was the most dangerous. They were going down a dangerous path and he he took that spot. So somebody else doesn't have to Jane Horton's husband, specialist Chris Horton was also killed in Paktia just a month after Kylie's father, he was just 26 years old. You know, for me when I sent my husband to war, he was not my own. He was our countries. He was America son. When you have talked to some of the Gold Star families which you have been such an incredible advocate for and for our veterans, what are you hearing? Number one, what did my loved one die for? It wasn't for this. My tears were not for this and hopefully our country will show us that our loved ones sacrifice was not in vain. Brian Moore is a 23 year veteran of the US Army. He's completed 7 tours to Afghanistan. He recently overheard a radio show host asking that same question was his service in vain and I just. That stung more. I mean, why would you even bring that up? Why would you even start saying that? Argument ask that question. Has nothing to do with the soldiers as everything do with the leadership, the. Our government and in the choices that they're making, not anything to do with the soldiers and their service, but a common frustration among those Americans directly affected by the war. The unclear mission in Afghanistan. The troops are not there to nation build, but we did. We did Nation build others like more worry about the friends they made along the way. I met smack gangs that worked with the government and. One in particular. He was. Didn't the nicest guy he would do anything for you? I didn't see him for a year or so and I met him at getting him. He called my name from across the. The way or the FOB, I guess, and had Brian oh, who's calling my name and I was like how did you even remember my name? It was it was great. General. Jack Hammond is a former commanding general in Koppel with memories of building a school for young girls. There we adopted an orphanage we built 2 all girls schools for regular schools while we were working with Afghan security to transition securities. You know, like everybody else, you pray you. You go on your phone and you look at the old pictures and you see the. Beautiful little kids, now Lord knows what's gonna happen to them. The Department of Defense announced it's offering mental health resources to service members and their families. This week after the collapse in Afghanistan. Services never for not it read. Remember that what is happening now does not minimize or negate the experiences of all who served overseas and those that were doing OK. They're not doing OK. And for those that would not doing OK the the they're doing a lot worse. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaking at a press briefing this week, acknowledged difficult days for our veterans. I know that these are difficult days for those who lost loved ones in Afghanistan and for those who carry. The wounds of war. Especially now we mourn those who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan. Let me say to their families and loved ones. Our hearts are with you, General Jack Hammond is retired now working at home base. A Boston based organization that helps veterans with what they call those invisible wounds of war. I'm talking to a lot of guys that weren't having any mental health issues that were doing really well. And for the first time ever, they now really a feeling it because that they're all ripped up. More has had his own bouts with residual trauma from his time deployed. Including PTSD. This is going on. And I am trained to do something about it. But there's nothing I can do right now, but he wants people to know that what he and so many others are going through isn't a struggle they face alone. But there's a whole group of people around that veteran that need help too. So think about those people and it's just everything now is intensified by. The last few days, if someone sees this and they're. Inspired by what I say and they go and they just talk to somebody about what they're feeling and. It doesn't makes a huge difference.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRyyONsrMlM,Thousands evacuate as over 100 fires burn across Australia l ABC News,"Nearly 130 fires are burning and more than 14 million acres of land have been charred leaving at least 25 people dead and over 2,000 homes destroyed.

#ABCNews #AustraliaFires #NSWBushFires #AustraliaBurns","Now that the historic fires devastating Australia some 130 fire there burning right now scorching more than 14 million acres of land. At least 25 people have been killed, and more than 2000 homes destroyed. Ginger there in Batemans Bay. With the latest this morning. Good morning ginger. Good morning, Michael. We've been driving around for seven hours South of Sydney today. It was just endless landscape, just charred and you can see there's also just hot spots everywhere like the ones that I'm surrounded by. I also have a new accessory this morning, my mask when I'm not talking to you. I'm wearing this thing because the air quality is horrible and the smoke look at this satellite image. The smoke from the Australia bushfires has now reached all the way to South America. This morning as intense flames still scorched parts of Australia. At least four people are missing, and at least two dozen are dead. NSW Police charging 24 people for allegedly setting some of these bushfires. An airline passenger spotting pyrocumulus clouds over the weekend. Essentially, fire induced Thunder storms. Lightning from those storms starting new fires. We believe what we saw as a column collapse that spread that fire dramatically in in a number of different directions. Also, it's an incredibly difficult and dangerous season. More than 14 million acres have burned, fueled in part by Australia's driest and hottest year on record. So when it rained Monday? People in Sydney cheered as the skies opened up. But fire officials say that the rain is actually hampering their ability to back burn. That's when firefighters set fires intentionally to control the progress of the main fire. Let's start with the the back burning. It's so counterintuitive for people to say I see rain that has to be good. It's definitely not enough to extinguish it, but it's just being a real pain in the fact that we can't actually light the fire in front of it. So it is a little bit of a problem at the moment. One of the biggest factors in the epic fire season that still has at least two months ago. The drought driven by something called the Indian Ocean dipole or iodi. It's a fluctuation of sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean and in its positive phase. The westerly winds that would typically bring rain. We can and sometimes easterly winds form that takes all the warm water and rain inducing storms away from Australia. Many areas are now haven't seen, you know, good rains for for almost two years. 10s of thousands have been evacuated, but for some escaping the inferno has not been easy. We had three different attempts for air evac that fails because it's too much smoke. Megan wagon, her family, were forced to seek refuge in a movie theater while waiting for rescue. There was actually ash falling from the vent, a helicopter finally managing to get in and give the family out to safety. You know how they say you never know what you got till it's gone. The air is definitely something I'm really appreciating right now. Fresh air. Can I show you something even when you see these hotspots, there's a threat. After the fire goes through that tree, burning from the inside out trees can easily fall. That's how people can get hurt. A lot of these fires were set intentionally that backburning we talked about. They're trying the firefighters to get on top of it because by this weekend the conditions get way worse. Guys, can you give us a more of a sense being there? I know this is your first time ever to be in Australia, not the reason why you wanted to be there, but we're glad that you are. Just give us a sense of of what people are dealing with. Her ginger. The loss, I mean it's unimaginable you think about losing everything that you have. Your neighbors also lose everything they have. They have a lot of help. They have a lot of heart here in Australia. I've learned that really great people, but they're they're feeling like this is only the middle. They're not even close to the end. They've got two months left in this fire season, so there's fear and hope combined, I'd say, but they are hearty people. They really are. OK ginger, thank you.

GOOD MORNING AMERICA'S HOMEPAGE:
https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/","We now overseas so the race to find survivors of that massive disaster in Indonesia. A huge 7.5 earthquake causing a tsunami that ravaged several major cities. Friday evening, more than 800 are dead. The toll is expected to rise. ABC's Ian panel has the latest good morning, Ian. Morning Robin, that's right, frantic search and rescue operations are ongoing, but there are real fears this morning that that death toll could go higher, and that's because responders are struggling to reach those caught out by the earthquake and the tsunami. This morning, a desperate search underway for survivors. After a massive wall of water surging hundreds of miles an hour ward ashore, ripping through a large island in Indonesia three days ago, triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, hundreds attending a beach festival when this tsunami crashed into the area, ways reaching as high as 20 feet in cell phone video. People are scrambling for their lives as the wave moves in. A man yelling and warning people as the tsunami begins to strike, but many more feared dead. After the tsunami hit dragging people out to see from the air the sheer scale of destruction is clear home after home life. After life destroyed officials saying more than 800 killed, many more bodies may be buried in the wreckage at the earthquakes epicenter. Areas still cut off over a quarter of a million people were living there bridges. Roads communication towers ripped apart the death toll expected to rise after many areas have checked the streets, now lined with makeshift morgues more than 200 aftershocks have shaken the area. Indonesia's president touring the damage in Palu as people lined up for food, gas and water. Amid the devastation heroism, this 15 year old girl pulled from the rubble and an air traffic controller staying behind to help the last plane out of Paolo before the tsunami hit. It cost him his life, but likely saving hundreds of others. And questions this morning about that tsunami warning system. One possibility is that the earthquake cut the electricity that powers at warning system, meaning many people simply didn't know that this deadly wave was heading their way Robin so hard to hear that those images as well. Ian, thank you."

https://twitter.com/wntonight","American police and security officials on alert tonight after a terror message. ISIS, the group ravaging a rock in Syria, renewing its call to followers to launch attacks here in the US. It comes as that extraordinary March was taking place in Paris. Look at all those people more than one million of them define terror. Also tonight another new video showing one of those Paris attackers appearing to pledge allegiance to the ruthless leader of ISIS. More on that March, and the investigation in a moment. But first, ABC's Pierre Thomas with America. On alert tonight Pierre Tom sources tell me tonight no specific threat has been identified, but the new call for ISIS but for violence is being treated extremely seriously. Clearly trying to take advantage of the aftermath of the attacks in Paris, ISIS posted a new message on Twitter overnight, calling on sympathizers to strike the soldiers strike their police security and intelligence members in the West. The target countries, the US, France, Australia and Canada. The video is a recut of a previous call to arms posted last September. Following that posting, the world saw Lone Wolf attacks in Canada when a gunman attacked Parliament and killed a soldier. Authorities investigating whether the attack was ISIS inspired. And this siege of a chocolate shop in Australia last month, which left two hostages and the gunmen dead. All that before this week's massacre at a satirical newspaper in Paris and a hostage standoff apparently perpetrated by another member of the same terror cell. When a new video posted online overnight pledged allegiance to the leader of ISIS, the fear tonight this new posting on social media inspiring more lone wolf attacks. The thing that worries me the most right now is the buzz on social media. Whether it comes from a specific group like ISIS or whether it's just on the the chat. Rooms today authorities were taking no chances with this new threat. New York Police immediately responded. Warning officers at roll call to not sit together in patrol cars to watch for approaching vehicles and to look at the hands of people approaching them. ISIS clearly has influence here in the US. Last year, the FBI arrested twelve Americans trying to join ISIS. So Pierre, what is the US planning to do about this growing problem with ISIS? Nobody is taking any chances. Police across the country are on alert and the White House is planning a summit to combat the influence of ISIS and al Qaeda. Tom OK. Good to know Pierre. Thank you."

They say a floating section at the front of Thwaites Glacier, that until now has been relatively stable, could ""shatter like a car windscreen"".

Already it is dumping 50 billion tonnes of ice into the ocean each year.

Meanwhile, in Siberia, the highest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic - 38C (100F) - has been officially confirmed, sounding ""alarm bells"" over Earth's changing climate.

#BBCNews #ClimateChange","Scientists are warning of dramatic changes at one of the biggest glaciers in Antarctica in the next 5 to 10 years. They're calling it the Doomsday glacier. Scientists warn a floating section at the front of Thwaites Glacier that until now has been relatively stable, could soon shatter like a car windscreen. Researchers in the UK and US are currently studying the rapid melting rate. It's already dumping 50 billion tons of ice into the ocean each year. The BBC science correspondent, Jonathan Amos has the details they are putting people on the ice. They are studying it every day with satellites. They even have robots going under the glass here to look at what's happening at it's floating front end and their assessment is is that they are about to see big changes there in the next 5 or 10 years. They expect 1000 square kilometre section simply to shatter because it has so many cracks in it and that'll make all the ice behind. Then speed up and. So this is a story about now, but it is also a story about the future about what is happening in this warming climate that we have on planet Earth. The highest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic 38 degrees Celsius has received official recognition, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed the record took place on the 20th of June last year in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk, which sits just inside the Arctic Circle as the region sweltered under an unprecedented heat wave. The extreme heat found wildfires across the forest and peatland of northern Russia releasing record amounts of carbon."

The call comes four weeks before the crucial COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow.

#BBCNews","Religious leaders from around the world have issued a joint appeal for international politicians to agree to a new global deal to combat climate change. Christian, Buddhist, Muslim and Jewish leaders were among those attending the gathering at the Vatican, hosted by the Pope. For their part, the faith leaders made a commitment to educating and influencing their followers about climate change. This is Mark Lauren is in room. They came from across the planet faith leaders urging politicians to save it. Christian and Jewish Buddhist and Muslim Taoist and Confucian signing a joint appeal to world leaders who meet at the Kop 26 in Glasgow to commit to. Net, 0 emissions to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees to support poorer countries. A Pope who was focused on environmental concern and an Archbishop with this warning. Our abuse our war against the climate affects the poorest among us. Reconciliation with creation. In obedience to our creator. Proclaims the love of God. The world. Has just enough time. To get this right. In return, the signatories say they'll educate their faithful, spreading the message of climate awareness. The document was handed to Alec Sharma, the cop president, to take to next month's summit, telling us the faith leaders are an essential resource. The message from them has been very clear. This is a critical moment for the world, and the message was one of the head and the heart. The scientists telling us the message from the head is very clear is that it is humanity that is creating climate change and we need to act now and the message of the heart is about morality. The call is urgent man-made climate change and fossil fuels have prompted the warmest decade on record with floods, fires and heat waves. This may be the last chance to halt the damage. Religion and science don't always go hand in hand. Climate change deniers are sometimes fueled by religious conservatives, but with research, finding 84% of people around the globe identify with a faith. World leaders know that those meeting here today have a chance of getting their followers to change their behavior. Marklo in BBC News at the Vatican. Well, at the British Embassy in the Holy See in Rome is the Reverend Graham Usher, Anglican Bishop of Norwich. Bishop Graham began life as an ecologist and was appointed lead Bishop on the environment by the Archbishop of Canterbury earlier this year. Thank you very much Reverend for joining us here on the program. Just tell us a little bit more about the significance of this event. Well it was a hugely historical event, probably unique in gathering together leaders of world faith communities, probably representing together about 80% of the world population all in one room in the Vatican this morning. So the Pope, the Ecumenical Patriarch, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and then leaders of all the major faith communities across the world with a very common message that we need to work together as a world community to combat. Climate change to change the way we live and operate and draw from the wisdom of our religious traditions to live more simpler lives on this single island planet. Home of ours. Well, the one thing that Catholic leaders and the Catholic Church have done is they've committed to dis investing in oil companies. So oil, gas and coal to get their money. Frankly out of it, isn't that what the Church of England should now be doing as well? Well, many Church of England diocese are choosing to divest the church commissioners and the Church of England Pension fund believe in conversion. They're actively engaged with pension funds and other investors throughout the world to bring change to the way in which oil and gas companies operate to bring them in line with the Paris Agreement at COP 21. So we are actively engaged in that process, seeing some results along the way, and if by 2023, those companies aren't in line with the Paris Agreement, then we'll be divesting from them. So so you aren't doing what the Catholic Church has pledged to do and and that is to dis invest in in oil companies. What we're doing is really committing ourselves to live greener and simpler lives to through all of our church networks and communities to look to be eco churches, and to reduce the carbon footprint of all of our churches. So we're actively engaged in this whole process and actively engaged in the dialogue with the oil companies to bring them into line. Are they doing that at present? Yes, yes, we are seeing some results there. And as I said, if we don't see that. By 2023 then they will be divested from indeed already some oil and gas companies have been divested from by the Church Commissioners and the Church of England pension fund because they are not reaching the transition pathway, goals and aims that we have set. But we're holding these companies confident that that's likely to happen. I mean, we are up against, you know, a race against time. Every report that we see everything that we see is that these companies, you know, continue to burn coal, for example, and. And that we should be moving away from that. So do you think that dialogue you know it's it's? We've run out of time when it comes to dialogue. No dialogue is working and we believe in conversion. We believe in changing the way of the world to align it to the values of the Kingdom of God. Certainly we still will need gas and oil going forward. You know, take out gas and oil now and you totally disenfranchise the global South because they don't have access to electric vehicles etc. You wouldn't be able to do the vaccination program that we have at the moment because of plastic use in syringes so. Oil and gas is still with us for some time, but what we are aiming to do is change the culture you support. The International Energy Authority statements that stated that the the 1.5 degree scenario, if it's to be achieved, no new investment is needed anywhere in in. In coal, in oil and gas. Well, I think we we want to move to that position by 2023, but what I'm really delighted about today is the fact that the world faith communities have come together under the umbrella of Pope Francis and the UK Embassy to the Holy See. To really pledge a commitment and to launch this appeal to the world leaders given to adult Sharma this morning in this unique event at the Vatican. Really to encourage the world to come together at this. Tyros time at COP 26. In Glasgow in just a few weeks. Time to make the changes that need to happen to provide the investment into green economies too, which is certainly something that we're doing as as to our church investments at the moment, but also to look at funding for loss and damage to look at ways in which we can support the world's poorest people who are already affected by the effects of climate change. Reverend Green will have to leave it there. Thank you very much for joining us here on the program."

#BBCNews","With just over a month to go until the Tokyo Olympics, Japan has just announced it is lifting its coronavirus state of emergency in the capital this weekend. From Sunday there will be relaxed restrictions on alcohol services and bars and restaurants. Some restrictions will still remain in place, though the current state of emergency allows only 5000 people or 50% of venue capacity, whichever is smaller. The government now saying that areas not under any restrictions can have up to 10,000 fans. Despite this, Sir, the Prime Minister asked people to watch the Olympics at home. He said, lifting the state of emergency is possible due to a recent drop in infections in Japan. Total number of infections in the country has been declining since the middle of May. The number of people in critical condition is also decreasing. What do you miss? Hippo taking your conscious. Abandon O'Connell. Cueshe joke Hokkaido. That was the Prime Minister speaking just a short time ago. We're still monitoring this press conference as it's underway. Right now it's quite a long one that the Prime Minister is delivering to the nation. He has just said that the country is getting closer to herd immunity as the pace of vaccination picks up. So that's just coming to us from the Prime Minister to remind you just over 6% of the population is fully vaccinated so far. Well, also, watching this press conference is Richard Lloyd Parry Asia editor. For the Times newspaper and he joins me now. So a big moment Richard, with the lifting of these restrictions and the state of emergency, will it prove controversial? Not really, I think this is what many people expected. Going ahead with the Olympics, that's controversial and the timing of this announcement. I think no one could deny it very closely. Tide up with that decision and what this does is in some ways encapsulates the dilemma facing the Japanese government as it presses on with the Olympics because it would look very bad to go ahead with the Olympics, the world biggest sporting event of the world's most popular city. Tokyo, if that city was under an official state of emergency, but on the other hand, once they remove the state of emergency, I think everyone expects that the the number of daily infections will start to go up again and five weeks from now we're in the Olympics, kick off. Who knows what level they will be at. We're expecting another press conference tomorrow from Japan's top medical adviser. What's he expected to say? Is he going to agree with the government on the lifting of restrictions? Yeah, I mean it's it's difficult, but behind the scenes we know. That the government and its scientific advisers have had some differences of opinion. I mean, these are not scientists who are going to step seriously out of line, but they have stood up and challenged the government on on some things in the past. And and I know from having conversations with them myself, that members of that advisory panel, some of them, are unhappy with the way the government handled it. They don't think their communication has been clear enough, and they think that they should be threshold set. For when the situation will be judged safe or not, the government gives the impression of not wanting to lay down those metrics, because at that might be caught in a position where it's forced or under even greater pressure to call off these gains, which it really doesn't want to want to do. So I think tomorrow the scientific advisor Mr Romney will will will, probably, you know, caution that this these games are not without risks and he will probably encourage people not to. Try and watch them in person. He'll want the numbers to be low, but I expect that he will not contradict this policy that has emerged in leaks in the last few days which you mentioned the government saying they want a cap of 10,000 on stadia but no less than that. Richard, the Prime Minister said right at the beginning he wants to avoid a rebound. He wants to avoid the hospital system collapsing. How bad is the pandemic been in Japan? Well, Japan is now in its sort of 4th wave, the 4th spike on the graph compared to the countries of Western Europe and North America. Japan's actually had a pretty good pandemic until early this year. At the end of last year the numbers were very low compared to almost every other big industrialized country. Now they're in a situation where that that's changing for two reasons. One, they've got this 4th wave and and new variants coming and spreading more quickly, but also vaccination rates are. Terribly low in Japan compared to almost every other comparably rich and advanced country. As you said, little over 6% of people have had both jobs. Now it's going to be a bit high when the Olympics come around, but but not that much. So that's the context all right Richard? Great to get your thoughts. Will let you get back to that. Press conference still taking place the Prime Minister now talking about relationships with China though, so he has moved on, but good to have you with us, thanks."

Boris Johnson revealed the figure a day after pledging that boosters would be offered to all over-18s by 31 December.

Long queues formed at walk-in vaccination sites on Monday, with some people waiting five hours to get jabs.

The PM and the NHS are now appealing for volunteers to help get jabs into arms and run vaccination centres.

It comes as Boris Johnson is set to face his biggest backbench rebellion since the 2019 general election as MPs will vote on new Covid rules for England later.

#BBCNews #Covid #Omicron","It is says the government, a race between the virus and the vaccine, and people have been rushing to receive their booster jab after ministers warned of a tidal wave of infection caused by the Omicron variant of COVID. That has meant delays for some people trying to access appointments and a fresh government call for vaccine volunteers. No variant of COVID-19 has spread this fast in the Commons yesterday, the Health secretary Sajid Javid said Omicron now represented 20% of cases in England. And was accelerating fast. The booster program has been expanded with anyone over 18 able to book a jab from Wednesday. That means NHS resources are being switched to focus on delivering vaccines and urgent clinical care. The health service in England has been put on its highest level of emergency readiness level 4 national incident, meaning it can be coordinated at a national level. A letter from NHS bosses says even with the protection of booster jabs, the threat from Omicron remains serious and the number of people requiring care could be significant. While vaccines are the first line of defense, the governments of all UK nations agree further measures are needed to try and slow the spread of Omicron. In the Commons today there will be a series of votes beefing up public health protections in England. There will be one on more mandatory mask wearing another on replacing self isolation with daily testing for people exposed to a positive case of the Omicron variant, but it's the plan to require a negative COVID test or proof of vaccination status to attend crowded events that has riled many Tory MP's. Actively, actually are and evidence from other countries suggests that they're not very effective, but also have a problem with the government requiring people to do that. Up to 70 conservatives may rebel against the government, arguing that these restrictions go too far. These votes will be judged as a test of Boris Johnson's authority over his party to a beleaguered Prime Minister who may well need Labour MP's to get his policy through Ben Wright, BBC News, Westminster."

Rajiv Nath, who heads India's largest syringe factory, says it is now making around 6,000 syringes a minute.

But he says that's still not enough given that the world needs 10 billion syringes to vaccinate just 60% of the population.

He believes co-ordination between the vaccine makers, governments, the World Health Organization and syringe makers will be “very, very critical” going forward.

#Covid #Coronavirus #BBCNews","The building that you are in right now. This one produces around 4 billion searches every day. The pandemic has been a rollercoaster ride for us. Well, we've had to hire 500,000 people more, and we've had to rapidly train them, educate them, motivate them so that they do appreciate the great role that they are playing in, speeding up the production lines without compromising on quality. We do get about 30 to 40 emails every day from new clients wanting to reach out to us from USA, Germany, Italy, UK. But in most cases give to say sorry to them because for most of the product lines we have booked till September. You have to play a balancing game between India's need and the global leads. We've decided to keep 2/3 of our capacity for Government of India and 1/3 of our capacity for the global market. How fast we can do it is the fight that we're going to be having against COVID. I would say better coordination between the vaccine makers, the government, and WH as a coordinator and the singe makers is very, very critical and I find that piece is slightly missing. We could have done better over there. And we can do better over there. So we are the guns and the vaccines are the bullets and the faster the guns can be provided, the faster the bullets are available. Humanity can try to go back to its pre COVID times and the economies in these various countries can spring back towards pre COVID times as early as we can do it. Better follow."

Lebanese people are calling it their 9/11.

Starting with the epicentre, here we follow how the blast sent shock waves through Beirut, bringing life to a halt.

The Lebanese are famed for their resilience, rebuilding after 15 years of civil war, invasion and foreign occupation.

But this disaster comes on top of an unprecedented economic crisis – and the Covid-19 pandemic. Will the country ever be the same again?

How I'm how I'm going to die? My colleagues and I rushed to the ER to find that there was actually nothing left. It took only seconds to cause so much death and damage that Lebanese people are calling it their 911. We're gonna take you from the epicenter of this horrific blast. And hear from the people in its path. As it ripped through the center of a city once known as the Paris of the Middle East. Killing and injuring. I don't know. And leaving more than a quarter of a million people without habitable homes. Beirut is the capital of Lebanon and home to 2 million people. It's an ancient city scarred by war but vibrant, welcoming a full of life over the decades it suffered so much, but no single event. As bad as this. This is the epicenter a warehouse in Beirut's port where the disaster began with a fire. Inside, unbeknownst to most of Beirut, were nearly 3000 tons of the fertilizer ammonium nitrate. And they weren't being safely stored when that exploded. It looked like a mushroom cloud. He felt like an earthquake. As far away as Cypress. As the shock waves radiated out, boats were blown out of the water. Grain stores on which this country lies were destroyed. And the firefighters, who'd rushed in when the fire first broke out, really didn't stand a chance. Safras was one of them, and one of the first of the dead to be named. She was a volunteer firefighter, just 25 years old and about to get married. Footage posted on social media shows her distraught fiance behind the coffin trying to lay his hand on it to get as close to her as he can. St. Georges Hospital is close to the waterfront. In the labor ward, a young woman called Immanuel was about to give birth to bring new life into the world. Her husband Edmund was filming when it happened. Lladro ceiling was down. I was afraid that. She might be hit or the baby was hit. She was all covered with glass. I tried getting my wife out first. I moved the bed outside and then I started helping the nurses and doctors to get them get them up. Amazingly, both the baby George and his mother are fine. All around the city. Moments of life. Moments of celebration were shattered. Israel, who's a doctor, had come back to Lebanon from the states to get married. She too was posing for her wedding photos when she was knocked off her feet by the force of the blast. I I was shocked I was. I was wondering what happened. Am I going to die? How I'm how I'm going to die? I've been preparing for my big day. Like for two weeks. I was so happy like all the other girls are I'm getting married. Where is gonna be happy seeing me in a white dress? I'm gonna, I'm I'm I'll be looking like a Princess on everything I'm not sure she. Animal salt lamp. I say no. Muffy, Muffy she is not. Limited. This is what's left of a neighborhood known for its nightlife. Many of the buildings here have balconies that overlook the port of Beirut, so people would have been standing on their balconies or near their windows, stretching their necks to catch a glimpse of the fire when the blast struck. If you were here when this happened where you were standing would have made the difference between life and death between a superficial or a very serious injury. Another BBC reporter was in the office on Tuesday night doing an interview over the Internet. It was a close Schaefer, Mariam told me. Though she is alright and so many others aren't. The explosion wounded thousands of people and hospitals are really struggling to cope. Lebanese people are famously resilient. This shows how strong the Lebanese are, says the man filming this. They keep saying. My family is happy. And there are ways. There were people who've been through so much who've learned to look after themselves. So as they try to pick up the pieces, they're working together to help each other with little faith in their government to do the job. But what now? For the country? Lebanon is already in crisis on multiple fronts. This catastrophic explosion has scarred not just the city skyline, but the psyche of a nation. It's become a symbol of all that's rotten in the political system. And it's left Lebanese people wondering how they're going to get over this and how much death, destruction and despair 1 country can take."

Zee News Apps : https://bit.ly/ZeeNewsApps","After the devastating bushfires of 2019 to 2020 that saw close to 3 billion wild animals killed, Australia is bracing itself for this year's fire season. Koalas are already at worryingly low numbers and they are particularly vulnerable in the Sydney region. They also face many other dangers, including habitat loss. Take a look at the support for more. They are cute, furry and peaceful creatures known around the world as one of Australia's icons. Fast haunted for their pelts when their population was close to 8,000,000 koalas now face threats, probably worse than human guns and Trump's government. Authorities, scientists and private organizations dedicated to the protection of the tree marsupials. Now say their population has dramatically declined, pushing them very close to becoming an endangered species. On top of that, young females will only give birth to one Joey per year at most. What we know with climate change is that this is going to increase in frequency and in severity. They're the two things that that we know and so. So that's a real challenge that we have to look into the future and forecast and build resilience in our habitats and our response capabilities as well. At present only in the eastern part of Queensland, NSW Victoria and in South Australia their habitat is threatened by many dangers. Logging and deforestation to make way for housing developments and roads and the well documented bushfires are all devastating news for the koalas who depend on unfragmented forest areas and eucalyptus trees for survival. Roads cutting through a koala's home perimeter are a problem the marsupial will cross them to get to other trees and thus risk being hit or even killed by vehicles, housing development and logging basically destroys the whole of a koala's home. So it's really important that not only do we keep really large areas for koala habitat, that also they're always connected, connected in many vein, and many threaded ways with other koala colonies and other habitat areas around so that they're for those numbers can sort of feed into each other. And it's also really important if we have another Bush fire, so that if there's another Bush fire event or something like that, koalas can escape to somewhere else. In recent years, the relentless frequency of natural disasters such as bushfires and droughts is causing much concern. Wireless simply don't have enough time to recover between events in the 2019-2020 mega bushfires alone, more than 61,000 koalas are thought to have died. Drought and heat waves create their own special dangers. Since the bushfires first responders received special training to rescue koalas that are wrong, a Conservation Society Australia and the National Park services have come up with a plan of action in an online training course for first responders. In case of a Bush fire. The cause teaches participants to assess whether wildlife is injured, identify the species, and report back to the incident management team. Coordinating the fire response. We are the problem and we need to do a lot better to help these guys live where they live because they were here before us. We choose to live where they live and we need to be more mindful of that and and learn to do what we can to live more adequately together. So protecting koalas has a surprisingly broader and more far reaching positive effect. Bureau report we own while this one. We are now available in your country. Download the app now.

So how are the Australian farmers planning to accomplish this target? Our next report will get you all the details. This sprawling cattle form in Tasmania is the brainchild of Sam and Stephanie Trethewey. The couple gave up their settled life in Melbourne. To fulfill their dream of producing climate friendly beef. And to do this, they've planted 25 different varieties of plants in their cattle paddocks. Nearly 14 of all greenhouse gases enter into the atmosphere as a result of livestock rearing. So this is a big issue in the fight against climate change. And when you look at the enormous task that we have to to try and curb climate change as a global civilization, carbon neutral is not going to be good enough. We've got to be net positive. We've got to be going that extra mile. To go the extra mile, the couple have registered their cattle farm with the Australian government's Emissions Reduction Fund. And so far have also managed to earn almost 15,000 Australian dollars in terms of carbon credits. Climate friendly beef product and also climate friendly products across the board. In the in the media industry is going to become really important. Sam and Stephanie are also using methane inhibitors to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released by their livestock. Customers across Australia are now more aware of climate change. And have started to demand beef that has been produced at such carbon positive cattle farms. There is still a long way to go, but Sam and Stephanie believe they have made their right start in making beef more appetizing for the climate friendly beef eaters.

To help improve and guide those who open their hearts and accept the truth. The actions and speech of the Prophet peace be upon him were guided by the creator of the universe. Muslims call the traditions and actions of the Prophet peace be upon him the son. Now for example something as simple as growing your beard and hair is regarded as soon and there is immense reward for every believer who follows the sun know with the right intentions. Today some may grow their beard and hair for the sake of fashion while others may do it to be more like the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. The reward is based on the inner intentions, which is known only by a loss of Hanover to Allah. Who is Ali the all knowing now I want you to imagine for a second that you had in your possession the blueprint to success. A guy that shows exactly what you need to do to be the best version of yourself. From the very basics to the most intricate details, would you not do everything in your power to follow it? The fact is, we have this blueprint and those who stray from it are not from the Prophet. Peace be upon him in an authentic narration. The messenger of Allah, Sallallahu Alley, was seldom said, whoever turns away from my son is not from me, albahari and Muslim. This statement clearly highlights the importance of following the Sunnah, but Satan, the enemy of humankind, works tirelessly day and night with his army to divert the world away from the truth. If we analyze the developing world over the past 100 years, we can see clearly how most of the world has gone in the complete opposite direction. Haram and sinfulness is celebrated and promoted by this so called modern world. And the sooner is looked at like a backwards thing that has no place in modern Western civilization. We have seen footage from 100 years ago of how women in the UK were dressed. Most clothing was modest and the hair was covered, similar to how Muslim women today cover themselves. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said that a time will come when women will be closed yet naked. This prophecy is a reality that has been made evident today. Skin tight clothes is a modern trend that displays the entire body as though the person is naked, yet they're closed. When the world moves away from truth and guidance, it can only lead to misguidance and self destruction. The previous generations were completely destroyed for their sins. Not the sins people do in private, but when evil becomes prevalent and accepted by the majority, many prophets that came to warn the people about God were often tortured and killed and serious in Allah tells us about the people of Yasin. He sent 2 prophets to guide the people but they rejected them. Then a last sent a third profit to strengthen the two. But still the people rejected the truth. When a man from amongst them came from the furthest. End of the city to tell the people to follow the prophets of Allah. They killed him and Subhanallah he entered into paradise and said if only my people knew they rejected the truth and harmed those who wish to be guided a lot. Subhanallah Tyler then sent the Angel Jibril to him. He uprooted the main gate of their town and let out a cry that completely destroyed them. Yeah. In love. Mr. The modern world today has exceeded the limits that have been sent by our creator. If we do not work to reverse this damage, we may reach a point of no return.

I remember at the mosque I was at the mosque this happened a few years ago. A non Muslim man entered the mosque one time and he looked quite distraught. I still remember his face a panel while he was in between mid 30s to 40s. He looked quite affluent and he was very well spoken. He came up to me and said. Can I pray in your mosque your way? I said, well, do you believe in my way? Do you believe in your? Slim says no, I've never been taught anything, but I just want to pray your way because I'm in a lot of trouble. I don't want to talk about his problem, but he wanted to go to any God. Any God that is the truth. I'll presume that it we've gone to other places as well. Other places of worship, but he also came to the mosque searching for the true God to ask him to help him in his problem. You know, where did he came up to me and said I want to pray exactly as you pray you pray next to me. I'm going to copy you so he did exactly as my movements. And then after that he said, can you ask God in the way that you ask him to help me and save me and guide me and I said the words and he repeated it after me. The man hugged me. Now you know Ozzy in Australia are not used to just hugging strangers. But he hugged me. So the guy was quite distraught. He was so much in need and he had. It's as if he had lost all avenues. Didn't know which way to go so he turned. To God, it was instinctive, since he was born as a baby, he left, and I thought to myself, so Pamela. This is exactly in the verse of the Koran, where a last minute Alice is in chapter 31, verse verse 13. I lost my Dallas says. Do you not see that ships sail in the sea by a loss, grace that he may show you some of his signs? Surely there are signs in this for everyone who is steadfast and thankful. Then I lost a planet with the ellises when waves engulf them, so they're in the ship and then waves engulf them in the sea like canopy's like mountains like hills, they call upon a lot. Sacredly declare their faith solely to him, but when he delivers them to safety to land, some of them become lukewarm. You know, in different half hearted enthusiasm dies out, they forget. None denies our signs except the deceitful, the treacherous and the untrustworthy. See where they were before and how much they needed a lot. And then some people when they're safe from their calamity, how quick they return back to being ungrateful to align a lot calls and treacherous meaning. First, you call upon me sincerely, as it should be, and you connect yourself with me and I save you. And then you betray your own self. Subhanallah Ceelo did not say that he. He betrayed him, although doesn't need that he betrayed yourself and I lost my hair, always wanting you to straighten yourself up before you return to him. Yeah, yeah. Overwatch. Money. Yeah. You know? Dina oil morning."

This is the last thing I'm sharing with you and Charlotte alla. There are people who Allah makes many things easy for them. Please listen to this carefully along. Makes many things easier for them. For some of you allow made money easy for you. It's just easy for you. For some of you confidence is easy. It's no big deal. Other people get nervous. You don't get nervous. For some students of mine, studies are easy. Like I I study, I teach Arabic. Some of my students. Well, lucky I could tell a lot, made Arabic easy for this one. And the other one mahuli Kalidasa. He wasn't made to study Arabic. He said he's a smartest guy in his field. He will be a PhD in physics, he can't do Modafinil dauphinais, he can't do it. You know he wasn't made for it. This is tough for him. Not everybody is the same. Now what happens is when people get used to success. Alan makes one thing easy. Then he makes the next thing easier, then makes the next thing easy and the next thing easy is everything always going to be easy? No, sometimes you will fail. There's a student who gets used to getting 100 the first time, the second time, the third time the 4th time and the fifth time he gets a 50. All of a sudden, and he's used to what? 100 so he said, oh forget it, I am worthless. A life, no longer with me. You know what's the point now 'cause you get, you get used to writing so high that one little failure. One set back and you're just crushed. You are completely crushed. What's the point? I'm dropping out of school. I don't want to do this anymore. I hate this. You know what we have to? That's this is when you didn't remind yourself at every single success that that success was a combination of two things. Your effort and unless help every single hundred you got before wasn't because it was easy. You put effort and a lot. A lot gave his Barca, you put effort and a leg gave his Baraka. And this time when it doesn't happen, two things could be wrong. Number one, maybe you didn't put enough effort and when you don't put enough effort a lot does not give his Barca. And maybe even if you put effort, ELE decided that he will not give you what I can. Maybe that's better for you. One of my best friends in life used to be a Hindu and he wanted to go to Med school. He was a straight A student. Straight A's entire life. Perfect scores, higher scores in the essay Tees applied to Med school. He was expecting a full scholarship. He got rejected. It was completely shattered. He ended up in a different university. He decided to new computer science instead and he was completely still a Hindu. He's completely depressed. Except he met people in in his new college Muslims who he started hanging out with and within two years he took Shahada. And he looks back. Now he goes thank a lie. He didn't make it to Med school. When I failed Med school, I thought it was the worst thing that ever happened to me and now I look back at my life and I say I failed Med school. It is the best thing that ever happened to me. You know? His kids, his kids are memorizing Quran, Can you imagine? His kids are memorizing for his father when he became Muslim they they dragged him to his father, got so like shocked he took him to India to beat Hinduism back into him and he ran away from they came back. You know? Those kids are memorizing Quran so hard. So we have to. Sometimes we have to have trust in a love we get used to writing a high wave and one little set back comes and beetles are trusting a lot. And then there are others who Allah gives you one difficulty. Then he gives you another difficulty. Then he gives you another difficulty and he gives you another difficulty and you start believing that I will never accomplish anything. My life is just difficult man. Everything is hard for me. I keep getting fired. I keep failing my tests. I keep doing that. You get depressed. And even this one has to remember that success in this world. Everything that happens is a combination of two things I have to put in my effort. And allow will make the task easy. I know I said last but I have one minute left. Might as well use it for something. I'll share this last thing with you. There are two parts of this class so far. It's not even the hold on, I just wanted to share these two statements with you. Kelly Amri there's a. There's a sylvari. There's a very beautiful, eloquent statement. A lie is teaching us that if you have a calm heart. If you have a positive attitude and you have to look cool in Allah and you put your work in, then Allah will make your mission easy. But if you start with the attitude, I know it's not going to work anyway, but I'll try. You already began with a defeated attitude, a level not make your task easy for you. You have to come with shuttle. Suddenly you have to have an open chest, a positive attitude, belief that a lot will give you success in what you do. And if he doesn't give it to you, well, you know you're still saying alhamdulillah, but you don't walk into an effort. You don't start a project, you don't start doing any work, and you begin with saying I'm probably not going to succeed anyway. Given my track record, you don't begin with that attitude. Then a level not make your job easy for you. So if we have that good heart before allows, a lot will make our task easy for us, soprano. With that, I pray that a large wooded gives us all the ability to take advantage of the wisdom of our of the great prophets of Allah. I think he was a lot of that is captured in there do as they said such few words, but they told us they told us so much of how to better our lives as believers and how to live our life successfully for Aladdin and also make the best of this dunia. Find the balance between this Dean and his dunia as he intends it, and milliput all of us to the service of his beautiful Dean and the Sumabat Anil Hakim. Hyati what they could Hakeem."

Now that Allah mentions his mercy out of his mercy. Also. This is part of our belief too out of his mercy. He describes Hellfire. It's out of his mercy that he describes health, why it's the scared straight program in Oakland. The idea that hell is not just described as a place that's bad, it's very graphic. It's laid out, and because the Arabic language is so picturesque and it's got so much imagery in it, you can visualize some crazy things that are being described. So in the point of it is to terrify you, so you get your act together. If Hellfire wasn't described in such depth and such graphic language, then you know what. Why take it seriously. How how bad can it be? I've brought this up to you guys before what what's, what's the concept of hell in modern entertainment? What does it become? It's it's it's a joke. People were jackets that say highway to hell, flaming skulls, you know, cartoons are made of people from hell, action figures, superheroes that come from hell. Or people journeying into hell and coming right back out like it's, you know, like a prison you could break in and break out. It's all. It's no big deal. It's become a joke. It's become a thing to just. You know, entertain yourself with it. Makes for fun horror stories. This is a reality in the tree of zaccone. That's the proper name of it. It's one of the trees of Hellfire, a theme. It is the food of the one constantly engrossed in sin, a theme. It's like boiling hot water. It's and model is also used for blood, young leaf elbow tone. It you know how when you take oil. And you put it on a pen that's already hot. It makes that sound. I don't have a word for it called. Now the sizzling, the sizzling sound, that's right. It sizzles in the belly. It gets into the belly and then it starts sizzling corral hameme like the like the the scorching and the sizzling of boiling water. When it reaches its top. Who who fatty Lowell Asawa. Grab him and shove him in inside the deep very middle of the Hellfire of the roaring flame summa subwoofer. Then pour above his head. Now there's torture going on inside of him. Internally he says, laying on top of him and I dabble hamim from the punishment of boiling hot water. Look taste this innaka anta Kareem. You're the one right? You're the one that has the ultimate authority, the noble, the noble of the Pharaohs were drowned. Remember one of the great. Reasons that the the people of Mecca didn't accept the prophets message aloud describes them as too drunk on their own grace. You know, status mustafin, so lessons here. Here's what your new abilities were tasted. This is what it was in. Our own, this is the very thing you used to be in doubt about in Alma, Tokina. FEMA, I mean no doubt about it, those who sought to protect themselves, the righteous are going to be in a safe place. Fiji and not in Union in gardens and grapevines surrounding them. Yell bassoon, I mean Sundays in Western Europe in they're going to be dressing in Sanderson Estabrook, light, silk and heavy silk. Light silken have two different kinds of garments. Mutek Abilene meeting one another. So once they get dressed up. First you get dressing. You pick your outfit or whatever, then you go hang out with other people in paradise you're like, hey, what you doing here? This is motor kaabil tasting one another. Lynn Karoly Castle in that is how we reward, and we will also will. We will have married them off to hoard beautiful spouses, in whose eyes are what's the word? Hypnotic, whose eyes are whole grain, is called when the white of your eyes is really white and the dark of your eyes is really dark. The contrast in your eyes just is captivating. This is holding a name, yeah, their own laffy hub you could leave. I mean, they're going to be calling in it. All kinds of fruits sitting peacefully relaxed, and they're just ordering food. Hey, what do you want to eat? Let's have that food we had. And then they taste it. And we talked about the taste before, so they're just they're chilling in Jannah. They're not going to be testing def init Hilmo Tallulah except the first death. This is actually a sarcasm in local on. You know, the disbeliever said we're not going to have death except the first death unless yeah, first death. That's only for those people. There are only going to be able to say that first death we already tasted is the only one we're going to taste. And by the way, for the person in Hellfire, you could argue, well, they're not going to taste death either. Yes, they are, yeah. Boo Boo ran. Kathiru says don't ask for that today. Ask for that over and over again. You will experience the tortures of death one after the other after the other continually. That's the wood in Arabic. So on the one hand there's no death at all and the other is continual death one after the other while him and he had protected them from the punishment of the roaring flame problem Arabic. This is out of a great favor from your master. Well, who photos? Danica, who that in fact is the. Ultimate success while lastly in hustle is not complicated. I swear by the passage of time and time itself is proof that all of humanity is drowning and loss. It's not complicated, it's straightforward, not knowing yet, so they can just try to remember they can try to take the advice. And for Muslims there's another added benefit, unless has been made it easy on your tongue so that they can make an effort to memorize. So the meaning of here. So they they can memorize Quran easily, you get started. You'll be shocked how easy it is. You just never thought about it. You just never thought you could do it. Just do it. Just try one or two out today. Let's get started, but I don't have a teacher. I don't know. I might say you read this in perfect stop making excuses. Just do it. Does start memorizing work on your schedule? I'm not saying don't work on it. Work on work on your Arabic. That's fine, but memorize will make that a part of your life. And the day which you the days then you that you memorize Quran you'll notice about a kind your day that you don't notice in days you didn't memorize Quran. You'll testify that yourself. I just want to relax. So let's say this. These are the gardens not just of constant activity, but they're also of constant relaxation. Now I'm sitting back, softness, luxury I love. On beds and lofty high beds and couches, they're going to be facing one another, so there are now gardens, and there's a huge gigantic living room and you're sitting in the living room and you can see everybody, but I will make it so we get to see everybody. Everybody gets to see everybody else. Hey, you're here, yeah, I didn't think you'd OK. Well you know, welcome. Awesome, have you here too. How's it been? So once you get here, well, you know I died when I was 82 I did when I was 40. So how to love and then this guy in the back? He goes. I've been here since slide. The 3rd century 'cause I was Shaheen. I wanna tell us your story and we're just everybody facing everybody. They're talking. And of course, if you're hanging out together and talking, there needs to be some drinks. So and since they're sitting on couches already, they shouldn't get up and get their drinks hold on. I'm a little thirsty. Give me a minute. You want to get something? No, you all said relax, you'll talk with him but lock will be done over there. Meaning there are services that are constantly running around with drinks because in with cups clear crystal and drink that is clear you can see right through it, Sir, more drink. Ma'am, we drink and is passing out, passing out, passing out, passing out and everybody is getting drinks, you know. And these these servants are coming. You don't have to get up. And the drinks are clear white. Some of them let Vettel, Sherry been by there. I love that in white, white in taste, meaning you could taste the color. You see. The color color looks good or it taste awesome too. 'cause you know what happens. Sometimes the color looks good in India of a drink when you taste your like poo. What is that you know? Like me for example? I can't stand rules I can't stand but I love strawberry milk. First timers are rules. Down this sucker. So usually you go halfway down the glass and you're like. What is this you know? So, but this is now the color of it looks enticing, but you're still kind of scared. And then yeah, I don't know there's going to be let me try a little. No, you have the rest bomb. You drink the rest. This is Utah by that Chris. Very clear white white of texture imply white of taste implies the taste is going to be pure. It's going to be freshly shawty. Been for people that are going to be continually drinking.

A story was narrated that a woman from Bennu, Israeil, who was a prostitute. Imagine this was the woman's occupation. Write the worst of scenes. One of the worst of scenes, things that are unimaginable. Right, this woman did this for a living. And this was this was her job. That a prostitute was walking. And that she's seen a bug that was thirsty. Again, now this is shaped on. This is how shape on works in the scheme of things really? What is she going to do and looks of hammerli and from a Muslim perspective it's a bug. A dog that is nudges. Yeah, and it's not like one night it was a beautiful, colorful parrot that touched her heart or no, no no it was. It was. A stray dog. No owner. But this woman, she was able to get to the world water well and drink, and that she seen the thirst in the eyes of this dog, and that this dog couldn't get to it. So something moved her in her heart. So she did an act of good. She brought some water to the thirsty dog, and she allowed the dog to drink. The profits are low. Holly, who was Salem says that Al Azzawi Gel entered her into paradise because of this one good deed that she did. And this is Islam. Don't belittle any act of good any opportunity you get jump on it. Anything if it's goodness, be the first one there. The profits are low while he was selling speaking about the day of judgment. The hardest day in all of our lives. And he describes. And the profits are low holy selling, he says. Everyone of you will stand in front of a law and speak to a law directly and there shall be no interpreter between you and Allah. So right away you. You sense the tone. You sense the severity of the hadith. And then the profits are low while you sell him. He continues on to say. He says, and then you would look to your right. And all that you will see is the deeds that you did. And then you will look to your left. And all you will see are the deeds that you brought forward. And then you will look in front of you.

I've got my deeds to my right and to my left and people are scared and people are petrified and this is the scariest day of my life. And and and and and this is the moment of no return. And now the profit is advising me. See how Shaytan is telling you brother if it's not Hodge if it's not $1,000,000 in charity. If you're not going to give up a limb, you know in no no, no this is this is shaped and belittling anything that you do is that it is that all you could do is that all you could say is that all that you could give. And imagine you're in this situation, no, the profits are long while you're selling me. Saying so, save yourself. Save yourself from this calamity from this musiva even if by you giving half a seat half a date in charity. And this is Islam. But any good that you do? You will find that on the day of judgment and today you are alive. It's a golden opportunity to make the most of it. Don't waste my brothers and sisters. Don't waste your time."

The ‘Samudra Manthan’ is one of the most important events in Hindu history. Solar and Lunar eclipses are also associated with the ‘Samudra Manthan.’","Yahoo and Cato have been around since the beginning of time. According to the Perons, the Samudra manthan is one of the most important events in Hindu history. Solar and lunar eclipses are also associated with the Samudra manthan. A long time ago, the gods and demons fought a war that the gods lost. They prayed to Lord Vishnu to save them from the oppressive demons. Lord Vishnu told grandma. And the other gods that they should have a temporary truce with the demons. The gods will certainly benefit more from the churning of the ocean than the demons. Will Lord Vishnu made sure of that, the gods and demons worked together to churn the ocean using Mount Mandor as a rod and the serpent Vasuki as a rope. Lord Vishnu incarnated as a tortoise to hold up the mountain on his back as the churning of the ocean. Started several things emerged. As a result, the first was poison halal which threatened to destroy Earth. But Lord Shiva kept it in his throat without swallowing it. Come be new. The wish fulfilling cow celestial horse Uche shabba era. But the celestial elephant, the costume gem, the Parisot Apsara Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and varuni the goddess of. Liquor appeared 1 by 1 finally, dhanvantari, the God of medicine, made an appearance holding the pot of Amrit, the demons forcibly snatched it and refused to give it to the gods. Lord Vishnu then incarnated as Mohini the most beautiful female from in the universe Mohini and incarnation of Lord Vishnu was a beautiful woman. She came with an Amrit pot to the battle place. And suggested that the gods and demons sit in different rows so she could distribute the amrit among them, the gods and demons. Agreed there was one demon who was relatively clever. His name was swear bhannu. He disguised himself as Chandra, the moon God and managed to drink some of the Amrit, the sun, God and moon God noticed what was happening and reported it to Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu then cut offs were bhanu's head with a Sudarshan chakra but Swarb Anu had drank the amrith so he could not die but his head was separated from his body. His head came to be known as Rahul and his body. He prayed to Vishnu and Vishnu granted him a boom. The boom was that occasionally Rahu and Kethu would be permitted to swallow up the sun and moon in a fight for power. The gods attained the amrit while the demons did not. The gods became more powerful as a result and defeated the demons, reclaiming their place in heaven. Since then, Rahu and K2 has been chasing the sun and moon as revenge for separating the head and body of the demons were banned. It is popularly believed that when Rahul Key to catch the sun and moon, they swallow them, causing solar or lunar eclipse. But they can't hold them for long. And Sun and Moon emerge again intact, as they also had nectar and are immortal scientifically. Rahu and Kethu are the two points of intersection of the parts of the Sun and the Moon. They are considered to be important because they cause eclipses. The North and South lunar nodes are called Rahu and Kethu respectively. Sometimes, when the moon passes these nods. It is aligned perfectly between the Earth and the sun to create eclipses as per Vedic astrology. Rahu and Kethu are two very strong planets even though they technically don't exist. According to astronomy, they play a significant role in Jodi Shaastra so they are important to take into account when making calculations. They are represented as mathematical points when doing Vedic astrology there are. A few different explanations for why sun and moon incision points are effective. The sun represents the body, whereas the moon represents the mind. Hence these incision points strongly affect the energy of these two parts of the body. These points help to regulate energy flow in the body. Thank you so much, guys, for watching this video. If you liked it, like comment and subscribe. If you haven't already."

The Iron Age of hypocrisy and struggle at the end of Kalyug, the population of the whole world will be so reduced to minimalism that there will be no more power to understand what term or add harm is. And it's already there. Kuluk people will not have the power to understand philosophy consciousness then at that time when there are no more good principles, no humanity left, then there is no alternative. At that moment, Kalki Safdar will arrive and he will take a sword on a horseback. He will simply continue to kill all these evil and adharmic creatures and marked the beginning of another satyug, the Golden Age of Righteousness and truth. Nostradamus prediction about Lord Kalki. Nostradamus was a great astrologer and whatever he had predicted had always come true. According to his prediction, it was discovered. That a person will bear with immense power in the world who's holy day will be Thursday and will rule throughout the world. Both of land and sea. He will be the only person who will free the world from all problems. According to Nostradamus, this great person will come down from his throne and will move through the sea and air for striking the evil once with his rod. According to Srimad Bhagwad Gita, Lord Kalki has many similarities to what Nostradamus had predicted. Who would not agree that the Earth has undergone extraordinary deterioration? Of its biosphere. Who could argue that living a pure life on Earth becomes more difficult and challenging with each passing year? Who has not shouted about social degeneration and political turmoil? Financial chaos and pain and suffering caused by endless wars. Leaving aside each statement counter declaration and argument about the predictions and prophecies about ******* we really wish he is out there somewhere. Thank you so much guys watching this video.

But many believe it to be infeasible or fantasy, while others disagree. But is time travel really possible? Or is it just fantasy?
In the first part, we'll look at modern science, and In the second part, we'll look at Vedic scriptures.
Time Travel in Hinduism
When studying Hindu scriptures, there is evidence that suggests Interstellar time travel is possible. One such classic example is that King Kakudmi and his daughter Revati traveled to different dimensions and returned to Earth in the future.","Time travel is a mysterious subject in science and has been the subject of debate for centuries, but many believe it to be infeasible or fantasy while others disagree. But is time travel really possible or it is just fantasy? Let's first understand what exactly is time travel. The idea of time travel is according to the fact that we can either come forward or backward in time. We can go to the past. And go forward into the future. But is it just an idea or do we really have this ability to do so? There are two ways to discuss time travel, modern science and Sanatan Vedic scriptures. In the first part we look to modern science and in the second part we look at where **** scriptures time travel. According to modern science, some people believe that it is possible to travel back in time but the feasibility? Of this is unknown forward time travel which is traveling outside the normal sense of time has been extensively observed and well understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. There is some theoretical basis for backward time travel. In general relativity, such as through rotating black holes, however, traveling to any specific point in spacetime is a much more difficult proportion and is usually connected with quantum mechanics or wormholes. Time travel in Hinduism when studying Hindu scriptures, there is evidence that suggests time travel is possible. One such classic example is that of kinkaku dummy. And his daughter Drifty, who traveled to different dimensions and returned to Earth in the future. Kinkaku Dhabi was a descendant of the Sun dynasty Kaku dummies daughter. Refte was so beautiful and so talented that when she reached marriageable age kakuda me thinking that no one on Earth was worthy of her, Kirby went to the creator himself, Lord Brahma, to seek his advice about a suitable husband for his daughter. When they arrived, Lord Bramha was listening to a music performed by Gondorf. So they waited patiently until the performance was over Kokoda Me then humbly bowed, made his request, and presented his list of candidates. Lord Brahma laughed out loud and explained that time passes differently on different plans of existence. And during the short time they waited in Bramble, oak to see them. They spent 27 chatter yoga on Earth, 27 chatter. Yoga means 116. Million 640,000 human years. Brumbaugh said tokaku dummy oking all those whom you decide to accept as son-in-law in your heart, have died in the course of time. 27 chatter yoga have already passed the ones who have already chosen are gone, as are your children, grandchildren and other descendants. You can't even hear their names, therefore you must give your daughter to another husband because now you are alone and your friends. Your ministers, servants, wives, relatives, armies and treasures have long since been swept away by the hand of time, kinkaku dummy was surprised to hear this news. However, Lord Bramha comforted him and said that Lord Vishnu, the Preserver was currently Incarnate on Earth in the form of Lord Krishna and Balram. He recommended Balram as a husband for Revathi. Goku Dummy and Revathi return to Earth after only a short time away and were shocked by the changes that had taken place. The environment and landscape had changed, but what was even more shocking was the state of human culture and spiritual evolution. Mankind was now at a lower level than when they had left. The Bhagwad Puran describes that they found the race of men had become shorter. Reduced in strength and enfeebled in intellect, the daughter and father found Balram and proposed the marriage. Since Revathi came from a different time, she was taller than Balram. So Balram used his plow to reduce her height according to present conditions. Their marriage were then duly celebrated. This story is believed to be a possible indication of ancient Hindu knowledge of the phenomenon. Of time delation. Thank you so much guys for watching this video.

According to the survey, these catastrophic events occurred at the same time. The chronology of these exact dates establishes that all the Hindu kings who have ruled Hastinapur since Yudhishthir are the strongest evidence that anyone could understand. Therefore, it is shown that the Mahabharata war took place during 3139 BC. C. C., that is, 5,159 years ago.","DQ Shetra War, also known as the Mahabharata War. One of the epic wars of all time. This war has taken place in the northern part of India in Kurukshetra, but the actual date of the war is still a great mystery to all of us. We still rely on our ancient astrological methods to find the dates. These methods were written in a 48 page date wise journal that consisted of all astrological facts and figures called visual panchang. This book was published by the Kashi Hindu Vishwavidyalaya Varanasi in the year 1925. It states about all the three eras the Kelly era, the Vikram era and the Shark era in detail. Even to this day, the history of the Mahabharata war continues to be a subject of discussion. It remains to be a part of a subject of great challenge and controversies as the dates of the war and the Caliope Cali oak have been elusive for two centuries. The oldest known suggestion dates back to Aryabhatt. Aryabhatt, one of the greatest astronomer and mathematician of the century, was born in 1476 CE. His work in astronomy has become an asset to all scholars. He is known for the discovery of accurate value of Pi. He has also written a book called Arabati during 499 eighty which gives us the exact information about the beginning of colleague. In his book he has explained in detail that he was 23 years old when the three yolks, namely Satyug, Treta Joghd, Whopper Yoga and 3600 years of kale yoga have passed. In general, he states that he was 23 years old during the 3601 first year of Cali Era, hence concluding the fact that 3102 BC was the beginning of the Kellogg. Kellogg has been. Vegan as the root era to determine the chronological dates of events, kings, divine dignitaries, and supreme personality of our history. It has been a known fact to all that the KALLIOPE stated approximately about 5000 years ago. We had hundred of these proofs regarding the dates of the Mahabharat War and the beginning of the kalyug in our history books that were destroyed by the British and Muggles. But we still have more than enough material to fully establish the fact when Lord Krishna left Earth to extend his divine Adobe, the town of Dwarka was drowned and destroyed by catastrophic rain storm and flood that lasted for seven whole days. It happened 36 years after Mahabharata war according to the geology, evidence 3 distinct catastrophic rise events happened 1 near the Caribbean. Another one happened in Istanbul and the last one is Dwarka. As per the research, these catastrophic events had taken place at the same time. The chronology of these exact dates states that all the Hindu kings who ruled Hastinapur since Yudhishthir is the most potent evidence that could be understood by anyone, hence proving the Mahabharat war happened during 3139BC means 5159 years ago.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYSroF1gZg,How These Three fundamental Qualities Govern The Universe?,"According to the Samkhya philosophy, the entire universe can be divided into two main categories: Prakriti and Purusha also known as Maya or illusion and True Reality respectively. Everything that is changeable, which is not infinite, is part of Maya  Purusha, on the other hand, is the only reality, the only immutable element in the universe: the Self, the soul. Everything within Prakriti, the illusory world, consists of three Gunas. Here Guna’s meaning is qualities. These three qualities are present in all objects to varying degrees, one quality is always more present or more dominant than the others. The three Gunas are Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. The three Gunas are present in everything; food, humans, animate and innate objects.","According to Suncare philosophy, the entire universe can be divided into 2 main categories. Prakruti and push, also known as Maya or Illusion and true reality respectively. Everything that is changeable, which is not infinite, is part of Maya Purusha. On the other hand is only reality. The only immutable element in the universe the self, the soul. Everything within prakriti. The illusory world consists of three gunas. Here Gunners meaning is qualities. These three qualities are present in all objects to varying degrees. One quality is always more present or more dominant than the others. The three goddesses are sattva, Rajas and Tamas. The three goddesses are present in everything food humans animate and innate objects. Only the soul is eternal while Maya or Prakriti is changeable and illusionary or unreal. The difficulty lies in being able to discriminate between the real and the unreal. The ultimate goal of mocks is to see beyond illusion and to see reality. The person who is enlighted only sees the true reality. Thomas good. Thomas Girl is a state of darkness. Inertia, materiality, and inactivity. Thomas manifests himself out of ignorance and deceives all beings of their spiritual truths. Other tomsick qualities are laziness, disgust, attachment, depression, helplessness, doubt, guilt, shame, boredom, addiction, pain, sadness, apathy, confusion, pain, dependence. Ignorance Rogers, good, righteous Good is a state of energy, action, change and movement. The nature of Rogers is one of attraction, desire and attachment. And Roger strongly binds us to the fruits of our labor. Other Roger qualities are anger, euphoria, anxiety, fear, irritation, worry, restlessness, stress. Courage Rum Nation determination chaos. Set for good set. We're good is a state of harmony, balance, joy, and intelligence. Soto is the good attained by yogis and it reduces Rogers and Thomas and thus makes liberation possible. Other sattvic qualities are delight, happiness, peace, well, being, freedom, love, compassion, equanimity, empathy, kindness. Concentration, fulfillment, calm, happiness, joy, gratitude, courage, altruism, self control, satisfaction, confidence. The Bhagwad Gita suggests that we should try to transcend 3 gunas rather than cultivate them. Knowing the nature of the three gunas and how they tend to keep us in ******* and illusion, we must become wiser and strive to transcend. Him sattva is pure and beneficial. However, for those who strive for liberation, even the cultivation of sattva should not be an end in itself, as sattva also unites us to the duality of pleasure and pain. Southwick people want to enjoy pleasure and avoid pain. They are buyers and knowledgeable but prefer to live a life of luxury and comfort. Therefore, they engage in actions driven by desire and get stuck. Although pure Sattva is nothing more than an instrument of Prakriti, which is meant to fulfill its goals by keeping us tie it to worldly life under the sovereign control of its sovereign teacher. Therefore one can cultivate purity or saatva to suppress the other two, but at the end one must rise above the three and settle in equanimity, equality and. Unity of the self. One must go beyond the three gunas to achieve immortality and freedom from birth, death, old age and pain. Thank you so much guys for watching this video.

In other words, this area or loss of Hannah who Tyler is teaching us that he knows about our internal struggles. He knows about the pain that we're suffering and the tightness of the chest that we are experiencing. Whether we speak these pains allowed or not, whether you've shared them with someone or not, a loss of power, who retired at knows very well about them. So if there is. If you're experiencing this pain and suffering within your chest, what is the solution? How do you bring peace and tranquility back? Once again, listen to the last two hours. Social gives us the medicine. The air that follows laws or gel, he says Faseb 100. Then you shall declare the praises of your Lord. Make the spirit of your Lord Cecil Purnell or it's as though more superhuman Tyler is saying do not forget my mention. Do not forget my vicar in the middle of your pain and in your anguish and in your suffering. Don't forget a loss of Hannah who declare his praise, say Subhanallah subhanallah and keep repeating it for as long as you need until you feel that contentment.

Here's you as you whisper into the earth, there was once a man that experienced terrible pains and hardships in his life, and his prayers were all mixed up. He would pray on and off, and everything was just kind of disorganised in his life. So he began to pray all of a sudden, and his prayers were organized so they asked him what happened to you. How did you change, and how did you adhere to your prayers on time? Now he said to them, I searched for so long and I did not find anyone on Earth that will listen to my pains and my anguish five times a day, even though he knows about them other than a loss of having a home with Tyler. So he found peace and contentment. In his prayer Allahu Akbar, my brothers and sisters, in Islam, every suffering in pain within you you're supposed to cry it aloud to a loss of Hannah. What I'll speak to a loss of Hannah. What island? That's why the prayer was legislated. That's why at this pier was legislated.

Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IslamicGuidanceYT","Hi. This is very unique story that happens one of the Sahaba of Nevius and Larry he was selling. He said myself and my 2 companions we had nothing to eat so we went, you know? If you're from the Arab country or from Muslim country, you would know. When the person is hinting for something that is in need. So he said, we went. And we present ourselves to the people. We didn't want to say. Please feed us. That you don't really tell people that you need, however you hint. You know it's not right, but you say I'm in need. Please give me some. This is not how a movement should behave. So we present ourselves to the people, ask them questions. But nobody understood what we want. Nobody wanted to hear us. So we went to the messenger over LA and we say yeah, so long. We are dying out of hunger. We are almost blind and deaf. We cannot feel or see or hardly hear anything because of Henderson, Canada. So help us almost in your Overlord special case. So the messenger over last set. Come. So he took them. And he said, do you see these three goats? They were gifts. Now all of us every night. We were assured the milk of these goats. So you guys take care of them. Milk them. And leave my share for me every night. So. Dad said it was fine at Hamdullah. He was normal. But one night, he said earlier. One night he long came to me. And he said, look? Is sufficient. And the messenger over law, perhaps, is with some of the unsought. And they probably fed him. So whatever meant that left with the mission you overlooked. You drink. Chat line is very tricky, right? He fools all the time. It's yours. It's going to go bad anyway. You know it's going to be old, so you drink. So I say to myself, well, I he's right. I'll sort of lines going to come back. With full stomach and he's going to go to his house is and he's not gonna even ask about the milk so Bismillah. So he had to drink the milk. He said as soon as I finish the meal. She said to me, wotu you what have you done? Now what else will come through one of these doors? And then when he sees that there's no milk, he will make against the person who drank his milk, so you're doomed. So just subhanallah. I felt so sad. You know, I'm grieving that I'm sitting there I'm so sad and he said whatever I have you have a little garment that when I cover my hand. My feet show. And when I cover my feet, my head show. So he says Subhanallah. I'm struggling with this sort of logist walk through the door, so I said to myself, you are doomed. So the messenger of Allah wanted a container he lifted. Is empty. So he stood up some of the law he was sending. And he raised his hand. That said, I was certain that I will curse me, and not only me, and my children were all going to be doom. The message of a light instead of making against the person, he said, well, I feed whoever feeds us. And provide drinks whatever provides drinks for us. Dad, he said Sobhana lot of solo. He walked away. And they said, well, Laurie, I would not miss that drive. So what did he do? He took a dagger and he went to the goats. He started the best of the three. And feed the messenger of Allaah so he can win the drought. The messenger of Allah. To Savannah so he said I went. And before I slaughter, I realize that out of all the goats are full again with milk. I say subhanallah. I checked the second one is for third one is ready marshalla. So I went to the one of the houses of the messenger of Allah and I said give me the biggest container that you have. So I came and I met all of them until it was full. So I went back to the messenger over LA and it said drink. God, where did you get this from? He said don't worry messenger overload drink and don't worry, just drink. He says so. He said, we drank the milk. And then he gave it back to no, no, no finish your you drink more is a finally. He gave it to me so that I cannot have anymore. So I drank some of it. He said then when I finish and he finished, I start laughing out loud. I could not stand up for my life, he said, then the messenger over last said, yeah, Dad, this is one of your tricks. What have you done? Then I told the messenger over lot exactly what happened. So he said to me, look at the generosity subhanallah why don't you tell us that we can give our brothers some of that milk? I said to him, he also he had enough milk and he had enough milk. I don't care who else goes hungry, but look at the messenger over last. You know he didn't say a law. Whoever took that milk, destroy him or make him blind, or a law giving this and that. No, he made offline. So the messenger of the law was the most generous person. There is the prosperity paradox is a pretty well established social phenomenon that having more money doesn't make you happy after a certain point. Middle class prosperity tends to actually make people happier than other people, but the more money you get it doesn't make you happier. It actually often has the opposite effect, because the richer you get, the more envy years you have, the less you can trust people 'cause everybody wants something from them, and then the other thing the public allies. Said contentment is a treasure that's inexhaustible. The Prophet chose to live a humble life over. He could have had all the wealth he wanted. He was offered mountains of gold. He chose to live as a person of Zoho for his poor people, the prophet, a man once said to him, it's in oh, so he had. If he said, yeah. I love you and the public's, I think about what you're saying and he said. He said it three times and then the prophet said. Get ready for poverty 'cause those who really love me. Poverty comes to them quicker than a flood reaches its destination. And one argument is that spiritual poverty to put the Prophet was giving money away constantly. He didn't sleep with money in his house. One of the things about Islam that I love is that it it that historically it created poverty with dignity. One of the things that we have in in the West. Is the complete. Undignified state of poor people. But you know that that's poverty. There's nothing wrong with with **** **. And in Islam, but there's something wrong with Messicana, which is abject poverty. There's there's no shame in being poor. Many, many poor people in the world that are beautiful people I. I've lived in the poorest countries in the world when I was in Morytania and I lived with better in one night. We we we we were with one of the scholars there we were with one of the scholars and he said when you get to incivil you might have trouble and if you do. Go a few 100 meters to your right and inshallah you'll find some help and we left using campament. When we got to a place called Icebear our our truck got sunk in the mud 'cause it had been raining. It was pitch dark and there was a Bedouin man there. This was probably about 10:30 eleven o'clock at night. He went and he took a sheep, and he slaughtered it and cooked it for us. And then it was raining and there was a lot of wind that night. He was holding the Iraqis of his tent. You know the main pillar. When we woke up at Fajr, he was still there holding it. He had spent the whole night holding that pillar up, 'cause he didn't want it to fall on us. That is covered. And cut Armand, or related generosity and dignity, and some of the most generous people I've ever experienced in my life for poor people. And we do them a great injustice. By not looking to their needs to."

About the problem for Salem says in the nation that preceded your nation, there was a man, a well known man, any man, a rabbi. Who everyone knew, what he looked like, how he dressed, how he sounded, and this man when he went to sleep at night, there was a particular night. He felt uneasy. He had a need that he could not solve. And that's you and I every one of us. You might have wealth but not help. You might have well been held, but the one you love is missing one of them, so you're up at night. All of us have something that plays in our mind before we sleep. And this man was in that moment. God, something that he, although he possessed many skills he could not fix for himself his problem. So the Prophet said this man said to himself. I will go out tonight. And give charity. The first person I touch, meaning I'm going to go out in the darkness of the night. I don't want to say a word I don't want them to know who I am. I'm going to change my clothing and go to a different part of the city where people don't know who I am and the first person I meet and come in contact with. I'm going to give them charity because if I solve someone problem a mobile solve. My problem. So the first person he touched came in contact with that night. That night he gave him Cherokee and Ram. The city he lived in the next morning, people in the city are laughing, laughing, laughing. He says to as he comes out of that what happened? Why is everyone amused? He said someone last night in the darkness of the night gave charity to a thief. Meaning there was a guy sitting in the dark waiting to rob him. And just before he's going to say, give me your money or I take your life just before he robs him, he says here's some charity and ran away. He went back and told the others. Can you imagine what happened to me? This has never happened before. I was about to rob this guy and he gave me charity. That man heard this. He's a rabbi imam. I love not going to accept charity. I wanted that, you know, an orphan someone like this. I didn't want a thief. I'm going to go out tomorrow so that night you went out again the next night and gave the next first person in touch and the next morning you woke up everyone laughing more. What happened last night someone gave charity upon the lady who sells herself Metalac protect our families. He said I was not going to accept charity too. I'm going to go third night next night. He goes now, but see this shows you the determination of the believer. He didn't just say I gave it a lot of my meet my intention. No, he's intent on pleasing a lot. He goes out. The third man gives charity. Everyone now is on the floor laughing. What happened, who? What did he give care to? This time someone gave charity to the richest man in the city. Who gives charity to that? You know the emperor. Laughed as you and I laughed. The properties are limited as that first night. The thief took that charity and said it's enough for me and did not hurt anyone else. Well. The second night, the woman who took this charity, she said, I don't have to dishonor myself tonight. And she stayed home and protected her family and her children. And as the third night, the king he received the saga, I'm going to go out tomorrow to give charity to others. He saw that although he had this well, he's not doing what those beneath him are doing, so he said, I'm going to do this tomorrow night. I'm not going to let anyone know I'm going to go out and give charity and then the property, I said. Lim said, never look down at a good thing. You do something. As I was driving to give the Jumma at UBC, you know we went through this part of town where there's a lot of you know people without homes and you know it looks rough. And I remembered this habit of the profits on the Meharry was. Sometimes, you know, you pull your children. Hey, don't give like. They're going to drink it. They're going to. They're going to do this. They're going to do that. Yes, perhaps they're going to take the $2.00 to $5 you take and not harm anyone else. That might come after you, and you might be looking at it from your perspective at a loss of how do I love? Might be sending you as their risk? Allahu Akbar or as risk for someone else in protection for them, don't look down at any good thing. You do. Always seek to make the good you do for AMA. This is why the man he was so sincere night after night. He wants to prove himself to Allah subhanahu. That I leave you with. Is the Prophet Muhammad Muslim? With the pockets of the law order, you would send them said that there was a lady made a law protect our families who used to sell herself. She saw a dog that was tide up. Unable to get food or water. So she untied it. Untyped the dog and gave it some water and food, and the prophets I sent them said for no other reason other than that act, the property I sent them said she did an act of kindness to an animal. Because of that, DA Locker gave all their scenes. And admitted hurt agenda. Why does the prophets? I seldom say these words because you and I we look at the outer actions and the moments of a person in life. But we don't know what brought them to that condition. You may not know of Miss Karen Foster homes. You may not know that that 14 they were hooked onto drugs. You may not know that if she was given your life, she would be a better Muslim than you. If she was given what you were given. And you saw how she used your life. You would be ashamed of yourself. Because of that, because for her to be nice to that legal animal, it's greater than what you would give even if you gave the charity of Portland. This is the reality. A lot of kind of went to Ireland, knows our circumstances, and knows why we do what we do. Can you imagine that a lot describes an act of a man? The problem by Salem teaches us is to move something harmful from the path of those who might come. You don't know who's coming. It could be a man or woman or anything. It could be a Muslim or another. It could be an animal. I thought that a lot speaks about and that the prophets I said let me shared was not just limited to those who we love. Sometimes we give to those. How are you you hear about Syria Sutherland? My family in back home in Egypt Sadaka it's almost as if it's attached to those who need but the greatest elements of soul that the prophet I seldom described. Some of them were two people who you would not consider don't ever add the law. Hold yourself higher in estimation of kokua with a loss of Hamilton. Alanos the ease that you have been provided and the good that you've been provided, so I repeat my invitation to you and myself. Take advantage. Of the luxuries that you have been given, the security that you have in this great country, the ability to have free education, healthcare, the opportunities that are provided for you to speak to people about faith, uninhibited freedom of faith and practice and religion. Take this that even in our own homelands where we might come from that these same liberties are not even accessible. You would not be able to sit as we sit like this in Syria. You would not be able to sit like this even in Egypt. Fear, a loss of power. Be conscious of what a law has provided you and use it for your benefit and the benefit of others. I mean also whom I was selling music. Even Mohammed. It is a pleasure and honor to have met and sat with you for a few moments and shared some words from the whole and from our Navy Mohammed Saleh.

1971 Convention: http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/year/1971","In an earlier video, we analyzed the debate between Ben Affleck and Bill Maher to see how religious literacy could have helped everyone gain a richer understanding about religion. But one subscriber pointed out, sure, great religious literacy is a fine and noble goal, but how the heck am I supposed to learn everything about religion? I have my own life to live. I have my own hobbies and my own interests. There's just no time in the day to go study everything about religion. And I totally agree when I say that society should be trying to boost religious literacy. I definitely don't mean trying to learn. Every minute detail about religion. Religious literacy is not just knowing facts, but it's a method for how we approach topics about religion at the forefront of developing this method is Harvard University's religious literacy project. They have an online class which I'm linking in the description below that narrows this method down to three fundamental assumptions that everyone should know about religion. The first one is that religions are internally diverse as opposed to uniform. Now I talk a little bit about this. In the Bill Maher versus Ben Affleck video, but it bears repeating. Each religion is incredibly diverse. Now. Of course there are big divisions like Christianity being subdivided into Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism or Islam subdivided into Sunnis and Shias. But there are cultural differences to a Hindu born and raised in India might practice or perceive their religion differently than a Hindu born and raised in the United States. But even on a regional level, there are huge differences. Evangelical Christians living in Boston will differ from Evangelical Christians living in Nebraska, or Evangelical Christians living in central Pennsylvania, even though they might share the same creed differences in politics and demographics and income levels might shape different expressions of their commonly held religion. But there is even diversity within a single religious community in a single Church of 100 people, you might have 100 different motivations for being there. You might have individuals that no longer believe in God, or people that hold so-called heretical beliefs that are outside of Christian Orthodoxy. All this to say that even in a single local religious community, we can't say that they all speak with one voice. When we recognize that religions are diverse on a global, regional and even local level, red alert signal should be blaring in your ears when you hear. Some pundits say all Buddhists are nonviolent or Christians vote Republican. Sure, this might be true for certain groups, but the statements are just so generalized they're not that accurate. The second point is that religions evolve and change overtime as opposed to being a historical and static. Alright, I admit that this also might be way too obvious to repeat, but many people don't. Appreciate the significance of what this means. Our religions have been around for a long time and they are products of their historical context. This means that religions, beliefs, and doctrines and theologies have changed significantly over the course of centuries. The Religious Literacy project, which I mentioned earlier uses the example of slavery. How the three big Abrahamic religions have reinterpreted slavery over the course of centuries, first justifying it. But now here in the 21st century denouncing it theology's change overtime to before the 19th century, you would have had a hard time. Finding a Christian who believed in the rapture. It just wasn't a well defined doctrine, but now, especially after the wildly popular left behind series in the 1990s, this doctrine is pretty common among evangelical Christians. Another modern example would be the Southern Baptist Convention's changing stance on abortion in June of 1971, the Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution allowing the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional. Mental and physical health of the mother and 30 years later in their 2003 convention, the Southern Baptist determined that the leadership in the 1970s were espousing a non biblical view on abortion and worked instead to outlaw it completely. All of these examples are to show that religions are not just internally diverse, but they are historically diverse to at every moment of time throughout history, religions constantly undergo reinterpretation by their living adherence and #3 religious influences are embedded in all dimensions of culture as opposed to functioning only in the private sphere of social life. Now this one is a little bit more complicated, so let's try to unpack it. We often think of religion as something personal. It's a decision that you as an individual makes, and you as an individual practices in your own personal life. But in actuality it is impossible to separate religion from its cultural context. Quoting the Religious Literacy project in the same way that race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic class are always factors in cultural interpretation and understanding, so too is religion, no matter what facet of culture you're looking at art. Politics, even etiquette, clothing and food. You will always find religious influences. So for example, consider something as mundane as the calendar in the United States, even though the US government is secular, Christianity is embedded in our calendar. Government offices are closed on Sundays. Christmas is a national holiday. Christianity is also embedded in US cityscapes, looking out over Boston. I see church steeples everywhere in the same way that we see minarets everywhere looking out over the skyline of Istanbul. When we recognize that religion is embedded in every facet of our culture. And not just relegated to our private lives, we'll be better equipped to understand when these religious influences are at work. So these are the three basic assumptions that I feel lay the groundwork for being a religiously literate person. If you understand that religions are internally diverse, historically diverse and religion is embedded in every aspect of our culture, then you'll be equipped to approach any topic about religion. Sure, knowing every minute detail about religion is great, but I understand that we're busy people and there's no shame at all taking this shortcut. As always, thanks for watching and subscribing and I'll see you next time. So as I said, these three assumptions come from the Harvard Religious Literacy project they are currently hosting a series of online classes on religious literacy. They'll be going throughout the summer, and no, this is not a sponsor. I just happen to have taken this class myself, and it's a lot of fun. So follow the link in the description and check it out.

Mark","The Gospel of Thomas is probably the most famous non canonical gospel. Everyone seems to know a little bit about it. They'll ask questions like why is the Gospel of Thomas not in the New Testament, or did you know the Gospel of Thomas might be an independent source to the sayings of Jesus? But what does the Gospel of Thomas really say? And why isn't it in the Bible? The Gospel of Thomas is preserved in its entirety in a single Coptic text from the non commodity library. A horde of early Christian texts discovered in the mid 20th century. It appears in a few Greek fragments to the Coptic manuscript dates to the 4th century CE, but it's probably a copy of an earlier Greek version that dates to the 2nd century, but some scholars have even posited a late 1st century date, dating Thomas is actually really difficult because, unlike the canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the Gospel of Thomas. Is a sayings gospel. It's comprised of 114 sayings of Jesus, no narratives, no sermons, just short sayings. So presumably editors could have added to the text throughout its composition. In fact, one scholar, April Deconick, argues that the Gospel of Thomas underwent several layers of composition, starting as a kernel of Aramaic Jesus sayings in the mid 1st century, all the way through to the 2nd century, with the version that we have today, though not all scholars agree with Doctor Deconnick to make things simple and to avoid this debate, let's just say that the Gospel of Thomas. Probably was composed in Greek and dates probably between 1:35 CE and 200C E, though with the added possibility that some sayings might date all the way back to the historical Jesus and some of them might have been an Aramaic. Now a lot of people think of the Gospel of Thomas as a gnostic gospel in an earlier video. I say why this assumption is a lot more complex than what you think the Gospel of Thomas actually lacks. A lot of gnostic features. There is no mention of a evil demiurge. There's no mention of eons or archons like what we see in the Gospel of Judas. We just have a few sayings that sound as it. Eric and the fact that the gospel was packaged with other gnostic gospels like the apocryphon of John in actuality, a large portion of the Gospel of Thomas has parallels to the New Testament Gospels. However, these parallels are always a little bit different, which leads some scholars to believe that the Gospel of Thomas is an independent source to the sayings of Jesus. For example, Thomas Verse 96 has close parallels to Matthew 1333. Jesus said the Kingdom of the father is like a certain woman. She took a little leaven concealed it in some dough and made it into large loaves. Matthew, on the other hand, reads he said to them another parable, the Kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened. So we obviously have parallel texts here, but there are enough differences between these two texts that make scholars think they are independent texts. Maybe one of them more original than the other, but who's to say which one is more original? This question is actually really difficult to answer. Some scholars think that Thomas often contains the older version of these Jesus sayings because they're more simplistic. In the canonical gospels, which often have very embellished parables, a good counter argument comes from Simon Gathercole in his huge commentary on the Gospel of Thomas. He argues that the Gospel of Thomas is non independent of the canonical gospels, and in fact whoever compiled Thomas was probably aware of the synoptic Gospels in Thomas Verses 1314 and 44. There seems to be some influence on the Gospel of Matthew and in Thomas versus 3365 and 104 there seems to be influence from the Gospel of Luke. Furthermore, he argues, since the Gospel of Thomas dates to the 2nd century. And is far removed from Jesus life. And since the Gospel of Thomas lacks specific details about 1st century Palestine, he concludes that it doesn't tell us much at all about the historical Jesus. As scholarship currently stands and with the primary sources that are available to us at the present, the Gospel of Thomas can hardly be regarded as useful in the reconstruction of a historical picture of Jesus. So at this point in the debate, we should just admit, yeah, some of the sayings are very ancient and some of them might date back to the historical Jesus himself. But the nature of our sources just don't let us know for sure. And very smart people are on both sides of the debate. So finally, let's tackle this question of why the Gospel of Thomas is not in the New Testament. Some people would say, well, since there is so much overlap between the synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of Thomas, why is it not in the fold? It seems to belong there now. The canonization of the New Testament is extremely complex, but there are a few factors that we consider to help answer this question. First of all, there seems to have been a lot of resistance to have anymore Gospels than just four. We have evidence that the four Gospels circulated as a collection. Very early on, even before the broader Canon started to develop. For example, papyrus 45 of the Chester Beatty Papyri contains the four Gospels in the book of Acts dating to about the 3rd century CE. So even while the Gospel of Thomas started to circulate, the four Gospel exclusive fan club was already starting to solidify. Moreover, there seems to have been a lot of resistance to gospels of Thomas and General Church authorities such as Hippolytus, Origin, Eusebius, cereal. Did I miss the blind, Jerome and Ambrose? All of these guys mention a gospel of Thomas, and all of them say that they're forgeries made by heretics origins quote is particularly striking. Also in circulation is the gospel according to Thomas. These come from those who set their hands to it, but the Church of God approves for a loan. Now we can't be for sure if these guys are talking about the Gospel of Thomas that we have today. After all, there were several books called Thomas. We have the infancy Gospel of Thomas and we have the book of Thomas the contender. But this is evidence that there was significant. Push back against any gospel named Thomas. So these are two factors to consider. If anyone asks why the Gospel of Thomas is not in the Bible, the four gospel tradition was very early and very popular and a lot of church authorities just rejected any gospel of Thomas. But we should also consider that in many respects the canonization of the New Testament was an organic process. It wasn't all top down decrees from church authorities. Certain books gained huge popular followings and circulated more widely. Matthew, for example, is known to be one of the more popular gospels of early Christianity. We found the remnants of about a dozen manuscripts of Matthew that date to the 2nd and 3rd century and 16 of the Gospel of John, but only one Thomas manuscript, and even then this manuscript is from the 4th century. It appears Thomas was just not as popular as other gospels like Matthew and therefore did not circulate as widely. Overall, the Gospel of Thomas is one of the greatest finds from the 20th century and has greatly contributed to our understanding of early Christian textual practices in early Christianity in general. At this point, though, I would say go read it for yourself. It's not that long and you might learn something new. As always, thanks for watching and subscribing and I'll see you next time now. This video is the latest in my series varieties of early Christianity where I try to approach early Christianity from a different perspective, not heretics versus Orthodox Christians, but rather looking at Christianity as a complex web of competing and sometimes overlapping Christian communities. We've talked about topics like Marcion and the Gospel of Judas, but if you have any suggestions yourself, feel free to leave them in the comments below and I'll add them to the queue and also special shout out to our patrons on Patreon.

Welcome to the second episode of Varieties of early Christianity. You can check out the last video right here. In that episode, I show that this evolution tree of Christianity just doesn't accurately reflect reality. Christianity was diverse from the very start and what we know as Christianity Today grew out of a supernova of competing theologies and communities. Well, today, we're going to push that evolution tree back one step further back to a time when Christianity and Judaism were not distinct. Today we're covering one of the more controversial topics in early Christianity. When did Christianity and Judaism officially part ways? Now it might go without saying that Christianity started as a Jewish sect. That is to say, almost every Jesus follower from the 1st century was Jewish and with the possible exception of Luke, acts all of the New Testament books are Jewish texts, so at least in the 1st century, we can't say that Jesus followers constituted a whole new religion. Guys like Paul were cultural critics and reformers looking to make radical changes to Judaism, namely inviting and non Jews into the Abrahamic. Covenant promise they weren't really looking to start a whole new religion, but by the 2nd century Roman authors started talking about a weird new group called Christians and some authors start using the Greek word cristianismo's, which we translate as Christianity, the church. Father Ignatius was the first one to use this term. Christianities most comparing it in opposition to something he calls you, days most Judaism, but if anyone should interpret Judaism to you do not hear him, for it is better to hear Christian. He's most from a man who is circumcised, then you die is most from one who is uncircumcised. So you might be thinking Christianity and Judaism. Ignatius thinks about them as two separate concepts. Case closed Christianity and Judaism parted ways around 116 CE around the life of Ignatius. But not so fast. Winning Macius uses the term Christian he's most, and you do, as most is he really talking about a system of beliefs and practices, talking about two separate religions? Well, no, he's not. He's defining orthodoxy and heresy like what we talked about in the last video. The scholar Daniel Boyarin has a lot to say on this issue, and if you want to answer this question in depth, please read his book borderlines, the partition of judeo Christianity, Dr. Boyer, and reminds us that this term christianis most was invented before our modern concept of religion. So early Christians defined it differently than what we would expect today. Their term Christianity referred to something different than our term Christianity. So what did Christianity's most mean to ancient Christians? Was Christianity a whole new race? A whole new ethnicity? Something completely different? Doctor Boyer and rights for these Christian thinkers. The question of who's in and who's out became the primary way of thinking about Christianity. The vehicle to answer that question was again, for these Christians, orthodoxy, and heresy. So when Ignatius uses this term, he is trying to show that identity within Christianity is not based on language or history or geographic location, which so many ancient religions were based on. But whether you believe or practice the right stuff. But as we talked about in the last video, we need to be very careful to distinguish between what an author is writing about and what was actually happening on the ground in society. This clean break between these two communities was not playing out in society. A lot of our assumptions about Christianity. In Judaism, parting ways is based on our privileging of belief over practice. From our modern perspective, this makes a lot of sense. A lot of people would define Christianity as believing in Jesus as the Messiah, but in antiquity, religious identity came just as much from religious practice as it did belief. So, for example, let's take a hypothetical ancient man from Antioch. This guy was born in a Jewish family, lives in a Jewish neighborhood, attends a local synagogue, celebrates Jewish holidays, and married. A Jewish woman. Oh, and by the way, he also believes Jesus is the Messiah. So what is he, a Christian or a Jew? Well, for all intents and purposes, he's Jewish. We are importing our own modern bias, our own modern criteria of what constitutes religious identity onto this guy. If we assume that his belief in Jesus outweighs his religious practice, The thing is, this guy is not so hypothetical or ancient sources talk about Christians attending synagogues keeping the Sabbath or feast days with Jewish friends. Be choosing their kids to Jewish families and marrying Jews themselves. Religious practice the way these people actually lived. Blurs are easy categories between Judaism and Christianity. It blurs. Ignatius is categories too. This is why Daniel Barron says belief in Jesus is not a good enough criteria on to say that Christianity and Judaism parted ways in the first or early 2nd century CE. E because in so many other ways than discipleship. To Jesus early Jesus followers shared a lot in common with. Ancient Judaism, in fact, some early Christian groups had more in common with Jewish groups than they did fellow Christian groups. So, for example, the Ebionites were Jesus following sect that saw Jesus as the Messiah, but they rejected that he was a God and they insisted on following Jewish law. Another Christian group, The Marcionites, rejected the entire Hebrew Bible and saw the God portrayed in the Hebrew Bible as an evil deity, oppressing humanity. So when you compare these two groups, the Ebionites and the marcionites sure they both believe Jesus is the Messiah. But the Ebionites have a lot more in common with traditional Jewish groups than the marcionites, since Christianity and Judaism were so diverse in the 1st century, it's impossible to talk about a single point in time when these two religions parted ways. Some Christian groups maintained very close contact to Jewish communities and held onto Jewish practices well into the 4th, 5th, and even 6th centuries later. Church authorities like John Chrysostom complain about Christians hanging out with Jews and the Theodosian code tries to outlaw these interactions. But they probably didn't have that much effect on the general populace because they were trying to impose an orthodoxy versus heresy dichotomy onto a society that just wasn't playing along with those rules. So in the 1st and 2nd century CE E We don't sell much. See a parting of ways between Judaism and Christianity, but we see what Daniel Barron calls a partitioning within Judaism when certain Jesus following groups started to distinguish themselves apart from mainstream Judaism. Authors like Ignatius Enforced this partitioning. Saying that Judaism and Christianity are completely different things and some Christian groups like the Marcionites did go off on their own, but on the ground, Christian and Jewish communities had a lot in common. In some cases the overlap makes them almost indistinguishable. The idea of a parting was a textual theme articulated and developed by an intellectual minority beginning in the early 2nd century. It was an ideal, strongly urged by some members of the church in the 4th century, and ineffectually legislated in some pockets of the Roman world. In the 6th century, I'm not claiming that this parting never happened. It obviously did since we have two separate religions today, but this parting did not happen at one point in time and it happened under different circumstances depending on the location around the Mediterranean. As always, thanks for watching and subscribing and I'll see you next time."

Pascal Boyer, Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought, 2001","Is religion biologically hardwired? Today? Will consider one theory that says it is but will also consider some shortcomings of that theory. It's called hyperactive agency detection device or had the fancy name for humans. Innate tendency to see agency and tension or personhood in the world around us. Even when agency, intention or personhood is ambiguous or might not even be there. So here are some examples. You hear a branch snap in the woods and you immediately think that someone is following you. You awake. In the middle of the night and you see a shadow looming over you, it must be a ghost or a demon. Turns out it was your coat rack. A breeze slams the door shut and you whirl around because you think someone is behind you, but no ones there. These are had experiences. The uncanny feeling that someone else is there with you. It's an instinctual response developed through our evolution as a species. As our species evolved in prehistoric times, it was to your advantage to be overly cautious to avoid predators to be. Overly sensitive to every sound or every image in your peripheral vision, because those who had a hypersensitive or shall we say a hyperactive sense of agency detection would avoid being eaten by that Saber. Tooth tiger stalking you in the woods. So if humans evolved a hyperactive sense of agency detection, a sense hardwired into the brains of Homo sapiens everywhere, what are the implications of this if we apply it to religion? Well, some evolutionary psychologists see this theory as the. Explanation for the origins of religious beliefs in supernatural beings, hyperactive sense of agency detection, plus our ability for abstract thinking, equals the building blocks for more complex religious ideas about the existence of invisible agents, gods, spirits, or ancestors that live on after death. If so, religion is hardwired into the very cognitive structures of our mind. But does this theory hold any water? Let's get into it. The psychologist Justin Barrett is one of the main proponents of this theory. Here's his thesis. Part of the reason people believe in gods, ghosts and goblins also comes from the way in which our minds, particularly our agency detection device, functions. Our agency detection device suffers from some hyperactivity, making it prone to find agents around us, including supernatural agents. Given fairly modest evidence of their presence, this tendency encourages the generation and spread of God concepts. Like I said earlier, he defends the thesis by pointing to how we evolved to deal with predators. If you're possibly being stalked by a predator, over detection matters way more than under detection. If you under detector predator, you get eaten. If you over detect a predator, there's really no downsides besides the occasional jump scare, so our minds must have evolved to over detect. So how did our ancestors make the leap from invisible predators to invisible supernatural gods? Proponents of this theory say that the jump from predators to gods is because humans not only hyperactively assume that there is something out there during a had experience. But humans also developed a tendency to anthropomorphize everything in the world around us, assuming that there is intention or personhood at work. When we experience unexplained motion and the natural world, Justin Barrett writes, cognitive scientists have demonstrated repeatedly that from infancy movement that looks self propelled and goal oriented activates thinking about objects as agents and further can trigger attribution of mental states. Beliefs, desires, and sometimes even personality and social roles so adores slowly creaking open a branch falling out of a tree. Barrett argues that our ancestors blamed invisible human like agents for these unexplained motions. This is not a new theory. Ironically, Charles Darwin himself theorized about the anthropomorphizing of invisible agents in the descent of man, though with a little bit more racism. He explains that savages believe that natural objects and agencies are animated by spiritual. We're living essences for the same reason that his pet dog barks at an umbrella, blowing in the wind. His story goes as it was every time that the parasol slightly moved, the dog growled fiercely embarked, he must, I think, have reason to himself in a rapid and unconscious manner, that movement without any apparent cause indicated the presence of some strange living agent. So in some way, modern scientists are reviving a very old theory. The anthropologist Stuart Guthrie. The pioneer of this field argues that humans over assume the existence of human like intention and the natural world. Now, of course, it's impossible to psychoanalyze early humans to confirm this, but archaeologists have inferred that our ancestors 10s of thousands of years ago would anthropomorphize basically everything. The archaeologist Steven Mithen, an expert on the evolution of the human mind, argues that the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene hunter gatherers ascribed personhood to objects and. Animals based on archaeological evidence, such as humans being buried with animals and cave paintings with half human half animal creatures, which suggests that our ancestors viewed the natural world in social terms. OK, so we've been relying on archaeological data and evolutionary anthropology, but critical to this theory is that hyperactive agency detection and anthropomorphizing the natural world is hardwired. So does neurology corroborate this? Well, some scientists seem to have located the part of our brain. That's responsible for this. Here I'll be referring to a study by Lasana Harris and Susan Fisk published in the journal Social Cognition. Harrison Fisk sent out to confirm if there's a neurological basis responsible for our propensity to anthropomorphize objects and the natural world in general. Using an MRI machine, they scanned the brains of their Princeton University undergraduates. They found that two parts of our brain, the superior temporal sulcus and the amygdala, activate when the test subjects were anthropomorphizing objects, while. In the machine this is interesting because the superior temporal sulcus is responsible for social perception. The processing of eye gaze, where somebody is looking, the processing of hand or lit motion as you're talking to somebody, the processing of biological motion, it's responsible for everything our brain needs to interact socially. This part of our brain is also responsible for our sense of agency predicting the consequences of actions and as well as our ability to predict and discern intention. Of other agents. So what are the implications of this study? Our brains on a subconscious level treat non humans as social agents and that there must be a neurological basis for hyperactive agency detection. Now, for some counterarguments and shortcomings of this theory because there are some doctor Mark Anderson, a scholar of the cognitive study of religion isn't quite convinced. While this theory provides a convincing evolutionary explanation of how such a bias may have developed, it does a poor job. But explaining how the perceptual system encompassing this bias actually operates this under specification is not a trivial matter because it makes it difficult to make detailed predictions about when false positives of agents are supposed to arise in human minds. Basically, it's a plausible origin story, but it doesn't provide a mechanism for how it's supposed to work, how the jump from predators to gods actually happens. Anderson argues that experiments have actually found the opposite. That religiosity predicts agency detection. If you are more religious, you're more likely to blame supernatural agents for had experiences. If you believe in paranormal activity, you're much more likely to blame a ghost or a demon for that sound behind you than when compared to a skeptic person. So here is where I put on my durckheim hat. I'm convinced that religion is primarily a social construct, something that humans do in groups and create together as an obligation to the community. Hyperactive agency detection does a poor job explaining why some concepts of God or gods endure for millennia from generation to generation. It can't really explain why humans intentionally anthropomorphize objects instead of subconsciously anthropomorphizing objects such as intentionally carving figurines and statues of their gods. These are cultural practices, and I think the social sciences are better equipped to explain these phenomena than neurology. Jonathan Landman. A cognitive. Anthropologists at Queens University Belfast agrees. Little evidence supports the claim that the had is an important 'cause of general religious beliefs. Despite a number of empirical explorations. Rather, the most potent causal factors in determining whether or not an individual acquires general religious beliefs appear to involve cultural learning mechanisms. So how we are socialized explains our religious beliefs. We get our beliefs by the people around us in US politics. You're much more likely to be a Republican or a Democrat. If you live in an area surrounded by fellow Republicans and Democrats, you're more likely to believe certain supernatural beings. If your parents believe them, or your community believes them in any case, in the words of my friend and colleague John Balch, who is an expert on this had, is clearly important for the story of religion. But there is still work to be done to understand the way it interacts with cultural and social dynamics. It's interlaced with culture in a much more complex and interesting way than just being. A misfire misfire. False positives when there's a noise behind you, hyperactive agency detection might provide evidence for a cognitive default for humans. Belief in supernatural beings, but we should be careful to not over commit to this theory because it has some serious shortcomings explaining how this process actually works. I've only scratched the surface of this topic, so if you'd like to read more or check my research, I'm putting a ton of articles in the description below.

Special Thanks to our Patrons on Patreon!:","Tell me if you've heard this before. Blank is not a religion, it's a cult. People have filled in this blank with all types of groups, whether Scientology Wicca. Some people have even put Mormonism in this category. In fact, many new religious movements that popped up in the past 100 or 200 years have been accused of being a cult, but this is a problematic way to think about religious groups, because cult is not a neutral academic term. It's a term that people use to accuse groups that they think. Are deviant, fringe or illegitimate. Given enough time, cults have an uncanny ability to eventually be considered a religion by the broader public. As they become more socially acceptable. So even though the old joke that cult plus time equals religion is true on one level or another, the scholar of new religious movements, Dr. Megan Goodwin, puts it a little better. Cults equals any religion. I don't like my fellow you tuber, Tirza Chesky has already gone over this topic at her channel ground up. Religion, so if you're interested, go check that out. I'm going to approach this topic from a slightly different angle. How has the term cult been used and should we ever use this term to describe small sectarian religious groups? The word cult comes from the Latin cultus, which basically refers to a sense of worship, reverence or cherishing. We see this in other English words like cultivate or agriculture and ancient historians today often use this term in this ancient sense. So when we talk about the cult of Mithras, we're referring to the veneration of the God Mithras. When we say the Imperial cult in the Roman Empire, we're talking about the veneration of the emperor as a God. The ancient historian and one of my personal heroes, Peter Brown, even wrote a book called The Cult of The Saints where he explores the development of Christian veneration of certain godly humans, like St. Simeon and how people built up shrines to venerate these Saints and their relics. In this sense, ancient historians use it all the time as an adjective, so sacrificing to the goddess Artemis could be called cult practice. The image of Artemis inside her temple is called the cult image. This term cult is just referring to the institutional veneration. Of the goddess Artemis. But this sense of the word doesn't have any of the modern connotations. It's not referring to small sectarian groups because the imperial cult was a huge empire wide institution, and it's not referring to groups with a single authoritarian leader, and it certainly doesn't have any of the pejorative connotations of religious deviancy. So in my recent video on the cult of Mithras, people were asking me, why are you using this term? It's not a neutral academic term, but I'm an ancient historian by training, so it was completely uncontroversial for me to say. The cult of Mithras I just hang out with a lot of ancient historians, but what about the modern sense? A lot of people use the term cult today to refer to small groups, small groups that they see as exploitive, abusive, with a slavish devotion to an authoritarian leader, and extreme examples like this do exist. The Peoples Temple, founded by Jim Jones, immediately comes to mind. Jones is sect famously led to the mass suicide at Jonestown in 1978, or the Japanese religious group AL Machine Renko. Which carried out a nerve gas attack at a Tokyo subway station in 1995. Now these are some really scary examples, but even for these groups, I wouldn't use the word cult. I would say religious group or apocalyptic religious group that carried out a nerve gas attack the instant that we used the word cult we're joining a non academic discourse that's labeling certain religious groups as legitimate and other ones as illegitimate, while at the same time lumping in other new religious movements along with these violent examples. Spoiler alert. Not all new religious movements are apocalyptic. Not all small new religious movements are violent. To illustrate this point, I'm going to use some examples from the historian Philip Jenkins, but first of all I want you to ask what do you mean when you use the word cult. If cult means groups that are ideologically sectarian and controlling of their members behavior, why don't we count the Amish or Hasidic Jews as cults who are by definition insular groups with strict behavioral expectations? I can't think of anyone that refers to the Amish as a cult. If by cult we mean religious groups that are violent or involved with sexual abuse, than that unfortunately will include a lot of religious groups throughout history, small or otherwise. And if by coat we mean groups with beliefs that are outside the mainstream, suddenly we need to ask who's mainstream. The more you look into it, the more you realize that the word cults just is not useful for academic discourse. It just has way too much ideological baggage. And it's too relative. One man cult is another man's religion. Mormonism is a good example. Many people called it a cult in its early years, and many people still do. But Mormonism is now a global religion with millions of followers. Some are even calling it the new world religion. Even Billy Graham, the famous evangelical preacher, removed Mormonism from his official list of cults. When Mitt Romney ran for president back in 2012, bringing Mormonism to the center stage spotlight. So if Cult is a concept that is just so changeable. Been so wrapped up with personal ideologies. Why use it at all? Well, as it turns out, scholars of these types of religious groups don't use this term at all. They use the term new religious movements. New religious movements are diverse, and they're small, but they are genuine religions and you might think they're weird or eccentric, but it's best to keep a level head and assume a neutral stance when you study them, because portraying new religious movements as freaks and irrational weirdos has. Actual real life consequences. A lot of these groups have suffered persecution throughout the past 100 years during so called cult scares. So next time you hear someone use the word cult, you can ask yourself are they using it to label some group as weird or deviant? Are they using it just to describe a new religious movement? Or maybe they're just talking about the cult of Mithras as always. Thanks for watching. There are some great resources on the topic of new religious movements, and I have barely scratched the surface, so check out the bibliography in the description below.

Twitter: @Lauraskitchen","Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitali. Today I am excited. We are making propoli how we're making a updated version. I made this for you a couple weeks ago on IG and I was teasing you telling you it was coming here too. It took me a little bit longer 'cause you know, Saint Patrick's Day stuff and yadda yadda yadda. But it is here. It is so good. It is so delicious it is succulent and you are going to love it. You know I'm not claiming this be authentic, it can't be. I'm not from Cuba but you know, it's delicious. You're going to love it. I know it, and you can serve this for anything. I love this so much. It's one of those things that gets better as it sits in the fridge. So go ahead and make a nice big one. I'm going to use Chuck Roast, which on the comment section in the DMZ. When I posted this and one of the things I love about when I post recipes that are coming up or recipes in general on the gram is that I loved our conversations. Right some of you said that your family and you only use flank steak, which you could. And then other said you prefer Chuck because it's more tender, it's more succulent, so really you can go many of ways. But I always love to hear how you prefer to do things, because that's what cooking is. Cooking like this recipe? You know it's nothing more than a guide you don't want to use Chuck. You wanna use flank? Go for it. You don't wanna use Red bell Peppers, you wanna use whatever else you said. Just take this as inspiration to just get in the kitchen. Make something delicious. Have your friends over. Have your family over and sit at the kitchen table, dining room table, whatever. Because that's really where the magic happens. You've got your nice big giant piece of Chuck Rose. Discuss some fat running through, which means it's going to make this so flavorful. Season it well on both sides with salt, pepper. Add it to your Dutch oven. Don't touch it. I want that to get a really gorgeous nice crust on it. It's not gonna be cooked all the way through. In the mean time. I am going to slice. I'm gonna use a red onion today. You can use the yellow onion. I'm going to thinly slice of red onion, one green bell pepper, one red bell pepper and a lotta 'cause you know, that's an amount. A lot of garlic. You look so good. Look at that crust, look at that gorgeous crust that's called free flavor. I'm gonna put it back on the same plate. Don't worry, I'm not eating it because it's gonna go back to cooking for a long time. I need to touch more olive oil. Not a lot. Maybe I need a couple tablespoons in total of. Rendering there so when you whoa, whoa when you brown that beef, right you are creating so much flavor that it is incredible, so much depth, so much goodness. If you don't do that and you just put the beef in a pot with a bunch of stuff in it, it's gonna be bland. So there's not gonna be any deep, deep delicious flavor. So trust me when I tell you it is a crucial step. You're not going to skip. Add in my vegetables. I added my Peppers, onions and garlic. Kind of just reduce the heat a bit. Through that medium and I'm just gonna like these cooking so they develop really good color. I'm not looking for to be deeply caramelized or anything, I'm just looking for these to cook down just a tad bit and then in here I've got my smoked paprika cumin and I got all ready to go in when it's time. They're looking fantastic. I'm going to add the spices in. I always like to add the spices at this point because what happens is once the spices touch the olive oil, they kind of bloom and all the oils really wake up. Makes a world of difference, by the way. Giant giant difference that's good enough. I'm adding a combination of crushed tomatoes, you could use tomato sauce and beef stock. In there. Smoked paprika is. Crucial. Crucial. Get your beef back in Nestle and it in there. It's perfect, and as it cooks. It's just gonna get so gorgeous and tender and fantastic. I'm going to. Crank the heat down to about like low. Gonna let it go for a couple hours. I want the meat to be really tender and succulent and juicy and delicious and then we move on to the next step but that. Is it for now? Alright, it's been about 2 1/2 hours. You can see the sauce has really thickened so beautifully. I took them beef out. I went ahead and shredded it. I discarded all of the fats. We don't need that it does not. It doesn't add anything anyway, so now. I'm going to go ahead and add my olives. You need some pimento stuffed olives for this. Oh my goodness, do not leave out the olives. Very important and all I'm going to do now is just put a lid on and let this cook all together with the olives. About 20 minutes or So what I'll do then is all season it with some lime juice and I'll start in some cilantro and it is done and then you can use it however you want. I serve it over rice, it is pretty phenomenal so let that go for about 20 minutes. I'm going to cover it 'cause I don't want it to evaporate anymore. I'm going to just go ahead and cover it 20 minutes and then I'll be ready to serve and I'm going to go ahead and get some limes and some cilantro. That looks incredible. I'm just gonna turn it off. Adjust it for seasoning with salt if you have to. I don't have to do before, it's really well seasoned and then the beef stock is quite salty. It does mean something vibrant and fresh. I'm gonna go ahead and hit this with a little cilantro, cilantro and I'm going to hit it with a little bit of lime juice. 'cause like I said, it just needs something bright. You could also add a splash of vinegar to this as it cooks kind of alongside when you add the beef broth and. In the tomato sauce, but up to you, I just much rather finish it with some lime juice and get the acidity from there. But like I said. You can do whatever you want. You can also actually add a little bit of wine as well, but. I don't. I'd like to keep it just. Like this, oh, it just smells fantastic. Let me. Let me skip this into a shower bowl and like I said, you can use this with rice. It's also pretty phenomenal over. Like cauliflower rice, if you want to keep it a bit more low carb. Totally up to you, but that has thickened so beautifully. The Peppers and the onions and the garlic have just practically become the sauce. Making my mouth water. Sorry, just gonna call it even for now. I got the rest of it out in a minute. I hate the sound of the scoops creeping in the pot. I avoid it. I avoid it if I can. Get a little bit more cilantro on top. Just a few leaves. And then. You can just serve some lime on the side. Look at this. It's just so tender and the Peppers. And the onions are just. Beyond. The beef is so tender it is so flavorful. A little bit smokiness from the smoked paprika. It's so phenomenal it is a classic for a reason. Everyone loves it. My goodness, I like to be in that sauce. No worries, just trust. It's a 10 out of 10. It's phenomenal. You need it in your life role are in the kitchen account for the written recipe. Hoping we just bring him with me. I will see you next time."

Twitter: @Lauraskitchen","Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitali. I was in the mood this weekend for Booker, T, Elementary, Shanna and. I was thinking I have not made an updated bukarti. In probably a decade, which I know about you, but it was time. Classic Italian recipe. It requires very few ingredients every household makes it different. Everyone you come across makes it different. I used to make it different by adding some wine. I no longer do that. I keep it very simple. Extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet or in this case a shallow Dutch oven and two we're going to add some really beautiful pancetta. I love the size and shape of this franchise that's precut. However, if all you can find is a tiny cut A pancetta by the bigger one and then cut it yourself because I don't think any smaller than this is going to really do. It's just it makes a difference. I know I sound crazy, but it makes a difference so I'm just going to go ahead and get that cooking. I want that to crisp up a bit, render some of its fat because the fat with the extra virgin olive oil. It's what's going to give you a lot of really beautiful flavor to cook your onion and garlic in your tomato products of choice I'm using. Laura Vitali homegrown washing stay. Home grown but they were grown in New Jersey tomatoes at Dar every single summer. But if you obviously are not going to be canning your own, a 28 ounce can of crushed or preferably Italian plum tomatoes that you crush by hand would be the best addition here. So we've got that. We've got. Buca teenie. It's a little bit hard to find sometimes, though. You'll find book artini. Sometimes you'll find patches. Tiny bit bigger, but you can see it's like spaghetti, but it has a hole in it. It's hollow. The texture of this is so crucial in a matic. Anna is very very classic, but if you can't find it, obviously go ahead and just buy. I guess I'm just gonna take an onion and garlic and start chopping. And Jetta is looking fantastic. Oh, you know, if you didn't have pancetta, you could use pick up bacon, which is a great substitute color. Bit of smoke to it. 'cause it's obviously a different product, but. It'll do. I've used it in a pinch. My dad has used it and he really likes it. My dad, Papa Sal actually would, you know? Born and raised in the good OL homeland of Italia loves loves baking in his car banana because he thinks that the smoking is really as extra flavor which. You can use guanciale. You can even use brush rooftop. I'm going to go ahead and add the onions and the garlic. The goal here now is to just cook everything together with a good pinch of hot pepper flakes. Until the onion and the garlic really softens and it becomes so sweet and delicious, so the sweetness of that paired with the intense saltiness of the pancetta. The spiciness of the red pepper flakes more sweetness from the tomatoes and basil I mean. Listen, we all know summer is approaching and everyone is going crazy and Jim and them and the meal planning and the chicken. I do the opposite. I come from myself, I comfort myself, knowing that we've got a couple more months of cold with a lot of carbs in pasta and I also get very excited to make a lot of pasta with homegrown tomatoes. So if you are like me, then you are excited for what's to come. I'm just gonna let these cook all together for a bit looking great. Don't be afraid by this bit of olive oil and rendered fat here, because let me tell you something, it's what makes this. Sauce so delicious. Go in with your tomatoes. If you could smell this if you could smell that it smells like summer, it smells like the sweetness of summer which I just love. So now I'm gonna do is I'm going to just partially cover this. Hit the tomatoes with a small pinch of salt or two. Partially cover it and I'm just going to let everything cook together for like 15 minutes or so and then in 15 minutes I'm going to add my pasta to the boiling water. It smells so good it smells so. Delicious. I'm just going to give this a cover and just let it cook gently for a bit while I tidy up. Add book art into the boiling water. Give them a few minutes. It'll work their way down. I just want to show you the sauce real quick. Yeah, let me show you this real quick and now move back to that. It's been cooking for about 15 minutes now. It's going to get about 10 more minutes or until the Buka teeny is ready. Taste fantastic. Smells even better, ashpit. Smells even better, I'm gonna go ahead and work my Buka teeny in here in the boiling water. It takes about a minute. I always get questions. Oh, I always get questioned. By the way, did not fill that part up with enough water. Actually I did. It was just boiling for a really long time and evaporated. I get questions all the time about whether or not I put oil in my water when I'm cooking. Pasta. Never. What makes pasta stick together? Particularly like a long noodle like a spaghetti or things like that, is the starch, right? So the important thing to do is for the first minute that you add your spaghetti or pasta to the boiling water, move it around. That way it keeps the noodles from literally holding on to each other, and for that starch to just release and stick on top of each other. It just releases throughout the water, so just give it a minute and you'll never have a need to add oil to your boiling water. Because all it does is coat the pasta with oil and then the sauce doesn't stick to it. So I'm just gonna let that cook until it's out dente and then we pull everything together. Buca Teenie are perfectly idente. I go right from the pot to the sausage, a little less starchy. Cooking water comes in. That's even better 'cause it really kind of helps everything. Stick to the booger teeny. All of this is going to be so fantastic. Very good working lunch if I do say so myself. Some kind of cook it all together for maybe like a minute or so. You just want that sauce and the pasta to just have a second to melt together. Do not and I will. I will raise my voice for this. Need a little starchy cooking water? Don't you dare be that person who puts the pasta plain on the bottom of the plate and a scoop of sauce on top. Don't you dare? We do not play those roles. We want all the pasta to be delicious, not the first. The top of the first four strands, right? And while that's happening because I am somebody that really loves when cheese is incorporated at this stage, lots of ****. Traditionally you use piccolino Romano. However, Piccolino Romano is not a cheese. I use a ton, so I don't typically buy it because it's expensive. 'cause I only like to buy the very best of the best. It's expensive, so I always have time on hand so that that will be fine. With me it's fine with Papa Sal. It's fine with me. I just turned it off. I'm gonna give it a minute to really get to know each other. I mean not sauces, saucy, saucy. Plate now I'm at Shawna is not saucy saucy this this is it saucy as it gets. Do you know what I mean? Very strong flavors. Need a little extra grading of parm. Because every single bit of pasta does, if you ask me a little bit of buzz, Nicole. And then I do like I do like the tiniest drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil on top. And then you know what? The only thing left. Fork and introduce it to a mouth. And it it, it smells fantastic. The sauce is so delicious. I love bikini bikini is. Ranks top. Of fear partnerships. I will say that. Well. That is a 10 out of 10. It is so classic it has all of the wonderful elements that make it so delicious. The shape of the pasta for me is so crucial. You guys such lovely intense saltiness from the pancetta. But then it's spicy. Yet it's sweet from the tomatoes, it's just it's to die for. And it's so easy look at how messy I am when I eat. OK, you guys know I'm a clean freak. I love to clean, but why doesn't that translate to how I eat? I have absolutely no idea I'm going to go in for bite #3 and then four and five and six and seven and eight 910. So I'm going to enjoy going to larryinthekitchen.com for the written recipe. I hope you enjoy spending time with me. List down below some classic that you would see you would like to see me update and recreate. I would love to do it for you. I feel like it's time but we enjoy spending time with me and I will see you in the next one. Bye."

Twitter: @Lauraskitchen","Hi guys, I'm Lauren Vitali. On this episode of Florida Kitchen we are making the most delicious Guinness beef Stew ever. It's so rich, it's so comforting. It is absolutely perfect for a crowd. It's the kind of thing that kind of gets better and better as it sits. You can't even make it the night before, so really, it's really up to you. Let me run you through the list of ingredients. Don't need, which are really not very many. You'll just need some bacon. You'll need some beef. I'm using Chuck here that's been cut into big pieces. Nice big chunks. I've got onions, celery, carrots, garlic, the usual suspects for Stew. We're so shower you'll need your Guinness. Of course you will need some beef stock. You'll need some believe, sometimes some. Paste flour, salt, pepper, olive oil. I think that's it. I don't think I'm missing anything else. So First things first. In a Dutch oven I'm going to go ahead and add my bacon. I really want to just render the fat out of the bacon, and once it's there and the bacon, then somewhat Chris, I will take it out. I'm just doing this because obviously I wanna get. I wanna give the bacon some texture, otherwise it's kind of just going to be melding into this too, but I also want to render a lot of its facts, so I'm going to go ahead and do that. I wanna bite while that's happening. I'm gonna season the one side of my beef so that when I edit it all in there I can see it in the other side. Season well with salt and pepper. So on paper here here we go. Hey, where's my other one? Here we go. Baking stone I wanted to see how much fat it rendered. That is why I always cook my bacon ahead of time and then I take all of the bacon fat out because as much as I love the flavor of bacon, I am someone that I don't really like the idea of that much bacon fat running through the entire Stew because it's just first of all, it's too much and second, it could be a bit overpowering, so I always discarded. In most cases and I always use this a tiny bit more olive oil, I'm going to see it in a little bit more with tiny bit more olive oil and then just really take the time to season and sear your beat because that's gonna add so much good flavor, so much rich and depth to this too. So once you have everything in one layer, try not to mess with it because that's where you get that really good crust. Looking here, look at all that good color. OK. Admittedly, look at that. I really should have seared beef and two batches, but you know. It's OK, we got enough color. Richness everything that's in the bottom of the pot is going to cook with your onions and your celery and all that, and it's gonna just get lifted by the moisture from the vegetables. A bit more olive oil you notice I'm only adding a touch at a time because I don't need to add a ton all in one go because I would need more for the next time. You know what I mean for the next step? So what's gonna happen now is I'm going to cook the onions and the celery and the garlic and carrots. Medium heat, not high heat, medium heat the moisture from the vegetables is going to start to lift all those beautiful brown bits from the bottom of the pot, which has so much depth and flavor it is insane. So while that happens you're just building extra flavor without extra cost, which I love, and then we'll proceed for the next step. Once these get some color. Adding some flower. Take a minute to really work that in and it's gonna look dry in a minute, but don't worry. Just give that everything a second. See, it's kind of like losing its flower look. It's getting absorbed by the olive oil, and then we're going to introduce some tomato paste. So you need about 1/4 cup. Like show. I love the sort of fun fussiness. Print This up the UN fussiness of us too. Because you kind of just sear, season, cook, caramelize and then. Boom, the magic happens as it cooks for a really long time you need your Guinness. Bill as me. It would say this is going to be the first in. It's going to lift all of those flavors. This is what's going to give that signature flavor. Yeah, yes. All those brown bits will loosen as it cooks, so don't panic. It's all good stuff. That's actually like the key to really good Stew. As I said, your beef stock. You everything is stuff. Then you need a few dashes of Worcestershire. Like that? Put your beef back in any juices collected at the bottom of the plate, of course. Along with your crispy bacon. Beautiful and sometime and BAE. I'm using dry today, but you could use fresh. And here you go and this is just going to come to a bubble. And then I'm going to partially cover and I'm going to let this simmer on low for a few hours until the beef is super super tender. Alright, the Stew is ready. I want you to look at this. First of all, you see how all those brown bits that were stuck to the bottom are now all gone. They've all lifted into the Stew. It is so incredible it's rich. It's got such beautiful, beautiful depth of flavor. The Gittis definitely adds something special and very unique. I would say it does need a ton of parsley 'cause it does need something green. And I also like a bit more black. 'cause I did take this. I turn it off a bit ago. And I mean look at that texture. This is begging to be spooned. Or lead. All that should say on top of some mashed potatoes. You know it is. Come on. It's begging for it, but for right now. We're just going to look how thick. Took a few hours, but really. I didn't do anything in that time. Look at that. I just allowed it to do its magic. I've got a fork. Imagine that he said I allowed it to just do its magic. And then I'm just going to reward myself. The beef is so tender. Turn out time. Go Laura in the kitchen account with the bread recipe you have got to make this up to. Enjoy spending time with me and I will see you in the next one."

Twitter: @Lauraskitchen","Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitali. You know this episode of Bar in the Kitchen really I should say welcome to the Saint Patrick's Day theme for the next couple of weeks. I love hearing from you a few days ago I asked on Instagram. What are some patron Saint Patrick's Day favorites of yours? If you celebrate that you feel like I should recreate now we all know everybody makes corned beef and cabbage. Which by the way, to my shock. A lot of you said that in Ireland you don't even make corned beef and cabbage, so you're going to have to tell me because I'm clearly not from there, but I was gathering lots of really good information. We were chatting a lot of you even told me about the recipes that your mom makes that they've been making for years on Saint Patrick's Day, so it really thrills me to have those kinds of conversations with you. But anyway, having said that, we have nailed down on sharing a few delicious recipes you can serve to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day. But really, they're delicious no matter what. Today is a very very random Tuesday afternoon, and we're gonna eat it. And it's gonna be delicious tonight. We're making cold cannon, which I am hoping I'm spelling that I'm saying that right, which I think I am, and it's really a lovely, delicious, Lee rich, buttery mash that we are going to then stir in some cooked greens and spring onions, scallions and it is phenomenal. I've been playing around with recipes I've been cooking. We're gonna make a Guinness Stew. We're going to make brown bread. We are going to make bangers and mash. We're gonna make lots of really delicious things that I feel like are going to be such a hit. If you are going to be celebrating like I said or not, what am I doing here is? I am peeling some Yukon golds. A lot of you in my DMS on Instagram when we were chatting about this, you were telling me that what makes a really good match for both your bangers and mash? Or if you're going to solve cold cannon with your bangers or just cold cannon, is using a very sweet, buttery potato. I think you can go and when you say that I jumped to it because as you know I am spud. If I were to be a vegetables, I'd be a potato because it is loved by all and it is my favorite vegetable. Of all potatoes really rusted is my favorite. Like a rusted Idaho potato is my favorite because it's very like fluffy and it's very. I say it's very dry but it's hard for me to explain. But in this particular recipe of really nice golden Buttery Yukon Gold is the way to go. I'm gonna peel and I'm gonna chop. OK, rinse the potatoes, give them a rough chop and now I'm going to plunge them into some cold water. Yeah myself a lot. No shower rule. Always start potatoes in cold water so that they cook nice and evenly. While that happens, we're going to talk greens. I'm using Tuscan kale. I have read so many different things and I have heard from so many of you saying that your mom will use cabbage. She will use a mixture of leftover greens so it doesn't seem to be like a right or wrong green to use here, but from what I've gathered something like kale, whether it's curly kale or Tuscan kale, is pretty much the most common. But if you grow up making this dish. Eating this dish or you make this dish and you're from there. I would love to hear from you and I would love to hear the tradition of Saint Patrick's Day if you celebrate, I would love to hear you know all those things. I always feel like you get to know people. It's like food so important and it's so powerful you get to learn about people through food, right? So I would love to hear from you because obviously I didn't grow up celebrating Saint Patrick's Day like most people did. We do celebrate Saint Patrick's Day in Italy, but we celebrate. Some somebody it's you know what I mean like St St. It's hard to describe you know Santa Clara is on October 19th and I only remember that I don't remember anybody else. It's because here we don't celebrate so I'm just removing the thick stems and I'm going to give these up. Really nice chop. OK, we gave the kale a really, really good chop. I like a lot of scallions in this, so I'm going to go ahead and use like 6 because they're kind of smallish. If they were really big fat ones, I probably just use three or four, but I like a lot of scallions in this, so I'm just gonna go for it. And you're gonna wanna just chop these slice these pretty thin as well. Muddle flying all over the place. Adding just a little. Butter to skillet. I like the combination of butter and olive oil. You can just use all butter if you want, which is a bit more traditional. I like the mixture of the two because the butter on it makes it nice and rich, but I don't want to be too rich because remember, we're also going to be adding butter in the mash so a little bit of butter and a little bit of oil. I just think it's much better balance. Waiting for that butter to fully melt, get nice and hot. Add the kale. My some fun chopped. And just let that go for a few minutes. You want that to start to soften and cook down. I would say about 3 to 4 minutes in a medium heat and once we're there I'll add everything well this time. These are looking really good. I went ahead and just turn that down a bit and now I'm gonna go ahead and Add all of my chopped scallions and I'm just going to gently keep this cooking together for probably another three to four minutes. I want everything to be kind of nice and soft, but still vibrant green. That would be that would be sous chef. She's a jumper. OK, she's a jumper. Potatoes are fully cooked. I went ahead and drained them. What I have in here is a little bit of heavy cream. Actually I lied to you because it is a lot of bit of heavy cream. You can also use a mixture of cream and heavy cream. I'm going to add a few tablespoons of butter because I want that to be really nice and warm for when we stir everything together and anytime I make a Mashed potato or mash of any kind. By the way, once the water came up to a boil, I added a generous amount of salt 'cause it's really only time to season the inside of the potato itself. Kind of like pasta and I like to reserve a little bit of that little cooking water when you mash it. Somehow. I just feel like you get a better mash. Maybe I'm crazy, but you know. In my mind it works, so I'm just gonna go ahead and mash this up nice and fine. As far as I can get it. If you want to, you can use a ricer but I really break out the reister when I'm making. Let's see what I got a vice or 4 on Saturday. And Yorkie, but other than that, I really don't because it's a pain to clean, so I'm just gonna go ahead and mash this up. We've got the kale mixture ready and waiting. I need to season this really well with black pepper. Go ahead and add the cream and the butter. And you're just gonna. Mix that up until it's really nice and smooth. Now some people like their mashed their mash of any kind a little more lumpy, a little more dry. Others like it super creamy and loose and smooth that you can type it out. I'm gonna say I'm someone that likes. Let's say a combination of both, shall we? That looks good enough for me. Remove them masher, don't move. I am going to go ahead and use this wooden spoon because we're gonna mix it all together anyway. That is perfect. I just wanna taste it for seasoning. Looks very good, it just takes it with this little fork. So craving, meat, salt, potatoes that are under salted. Not good. That should be good. Now go ahead and add your greens. Make mix it all in and just you wait until you put the extra a little extra butter on the top. Mixing mix. Look at that. A knife glorious. Listen, I'm leaving stuff in the pan because that's a cooked treat and I don't want to hear it. OK, I don't wanna hear it. That looks magnificent then I'd like. A couple extra dabs. Of butter because as it melts, it starts to kind of pull. It's so good, it's so good. It's so good, it's so good. Like so like that. A little extra grinding of black pepper to me. Black pepper is so important when it comes to a mash because otherwise tastes like nothing. Listen the wind Irish like potatoes, makes me feel like maybe I should be half Irish because I like potatoes like I like pasta. I like it a lot. We can see. Right around. In that area right there, the butter is starting to melt. Listen, listen. I'm going to go in here actually because that is 2. I don't wanna mess that up. 'cause I gotta take a picture. Oh so good. Great texture, great balance with the onions and the kale and the smoothness and richness of the potatoes. Oh now it looks so good. The butter is melty and delicious and phenomenal. I can see why it's a classic. I can see why so many of you deemed me and told me that I had to make it. Had to share it with you. It really is so simple, but it's one of those things that is just phenomenal. It just is. Laurainthekitchen.com has a recipe waiting for you. I hope we just spend time with me and I will see you in the next month by."

Twitter: @Lauraskitchen","Hi guys, I'm Lauren Vitagliano this episode of Lori Kitchen. We're making Irish potato pancakes. I'm not going to say the name it will be in the title. It become afraid I'm going to mispronounce it and I actually don't really like doing that. I like to mispronounce something. But anyway, this must be very new to me. I wasn't really familiar with it, but when I asked you guys on Instagram for what are the recipes that you want to see me make? For Saint Patrick's Day, I had an overwhelming amount of people asked for this recipe. A lot of you gave me your family recipe. In fact, one of you told me the ratio for everything which was so kind and it's just fantastic. It's like a combination of two different kinds of potatoes and if you know me, what did we talk about in bangers and mash? What did we talk about? We talked about my love for spud, so if you're going to give me a recipe that has two different kinds of potatoes in there. Well, sign me up, put a ring on it because I'm taking it home. OK it is so simple. Are you going to need or some leftover cold doesn't have to be cold, but some leftover mashed potatoes really nice and creamy. Then you need flour, baking soda and salt. You need buttermilk. You need some potatoes that have been shredded, soaked in water to release any of the extra starch you'll need. Some black pepper, some oil or butter, or both to cook them in. I prefer to just use olive oil. And I like to fold in some scallions. One of you told me that your mom likes to clean out the fridge and whatever cheeses are leftover, she shreds them and put them in there, which I think is fabulous. So all I'm going to do right now I'm is cut. Should say thinly, slice a couple of scallions and I'm going to go ahead and add them right in, and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to squeeze all of those potatoes to shredded potatoes 'cause I wanna make sure. Said there is no excess water going into this and then I'll get the oil going the whole thing. Squeeze all that water out. You can also do this through a cheesecloth, but. You want the potatoes to be like that. Really flaky and really light and look at all that starch. Is that insane? Look at that. OK, I'm going to go wash my hands and then we make essentialis like a batter. I like lots of black pepper. I'm gonna add a little bit more salt because I add salt to the flour, but I really need to add. More salt. And then you're going to add the flour baking soda and remember the baking soda and the buttermilk are the magic ingredients that are going to turn this into the most vicious texture and then. You're gonna add your buttermilk a little bit at a time. It looks a bit messy right now, but. Trust me when I tell you. It works so well. You'll end up with like a thick pancake batter by the time you're done. That looks fantastic. Essentially it looks like thick pancake batter, which is exactly what you're looking for and the mixture of the Mashed potato with the shredded potato is what makes this potato fritter or pancake so interesting. When I first read about it and when I first talked to you guys about it, you sold me on that you sold me on two potatoes. I've got a skillet nonstick skillet with a little bit of olive oil preheating. You can do a mixture of regular olive oil. You could do olive oil and butter. You could do all butter. I do find that if you do all butter, the butter does burn really quickly, so my opinion would be to do half and half because the oil will stop the butter from burning so quickly. However, I like the best cooked in olive oil because I think the butter is a little bit too overpowering. I know, I know. Listen, we all like what we like, right? So I'm just going to get that to get nice and hot once it starts to shimmer, we'll add our batter. Testing my oil. Lots of bubbles. That's good. That's good. That's good. You don't want the oil to too hot. You don't want the temperature to be too high because you have to cook the inside of your pancake so. Probably like medium heat is perfect. They will take about 5 minutes per side. Because they do have to cook all the way through until they're gorgeous golden brown color. I'll show you what they look like when they are done. Alright, after five minutes you just flip them over. They smell so good they developed these really gorgeous crispy edges. I switched to a bigger pan, by the way, because the girl was just not prepared. I had some already ready obviously. I'm gonna go ahead and taste one. Everyone pretty much told me to serve these with. Sour cream, so I will be serving them with sour cream. They are so good. Letters like a mixture between. Like a micro case like math like potato. Dumplings like a fritters. And then hash Browns with the texture, they're phenomenal. I hope you feel a punch. Ooh. That is. So delicious. I am obsessed. If you love potatoes the way that I do, these are for you, and I rhymed, you know what I'm done? Micdrop galore, inthekitchen.com for the written recipe. I hope you enjoy spending time with me. These are must make even if you have leftover mashed potatoes. Nothing better. Hope you enjoy spending time with me and I'll see you next one bye."

Twitter: @Lauraskitchen","Hi guys, I'm Lauren Vitali and on this episode of Lauren the Kitchen I'm going to show you how to make the most perfect chocolate chip cookie you'll ever have. They are so simple to make but they're so delicious and with just a couple little different tricks you're gonna see. That this really is so most amazing top of cookie ever. It's light, it's crisp, it's chocolatey. And it's absolute chocolate chip cookie heaven. So let's get started. I'm going to show you what you're going to need. You'll need some all purpose flour, brown sugar, regular sugar, semi sweet chocolate chips, unsalted, softened butter. You're gonna need some vegetable shortening, some eggs, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and vanilla extract. And these cookies are really, really easy to make. And because I. Had a couple little things in there that aren't expected there. Really going to be amazing. You have to trust me on that and they're gonna make a lot of cookies so be ready. It's gonna make about four dozen. So get your mixer ready with the pile attachment. We're going to start with our sugar. I have here 3/4 of a cup of regular sugar, 3/4 of a cup, a softened brown sugar, and we're going to put in the butter and vegetable shortening. Now most people just use butter. They don't use vegetable shortening, but. I have decided I when I started thinking about writing the perfect recipe for the targeted cookies. I thought well, when you make a pie crust you use the butter for flavoring and the shortening for that really amazing crisp light texture that it gives you. So why not do it in a cookie and I tried it and it was amazing. So just trust me. So medium speed cream this together just until it literally comes together, not while I'm going to put in the eggs. Here we go, my butter and sugar mixture is perfectly creamy, not heads up. I took my spatula and just scraped down the sides of it because sometimes what happens is while everything is spinning, it tends to stick to the sides of the ball and not incorporate all the way to the bottom. So just give it a nice Little Mix. If you see that that's happening then I'm going to add in my eggs. And I'm going to add in my vanilla. A couple of teaspoons. Back down. This makes this together until everything is nice and creamy and well blended. It's got that ready. Just going to scrape it down. I got creamy that is, that's exactly what you want. Perfect, OK, now we're going to add in. Our dry ingredients. I'm going to add in two and 1/4 cups of all purpose flour. Dump that all in. I'm gonna add in one teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of baking soda, and an eighth of a teaspoon of cinnamon might sound really strange, but the cinnamon adds a note that you really can't replace it. You don't just taste like cinnamon in your mouth, 'cause it's not a cinnamon based cookie, but it's somehow just makes the chocolate taste really chocolaty and it makes the cookie just really just so good. You just have to trust me and just try it once. If you don't like it, just don't make the cinnamon, but I'm sure you're gonna love it. OK, speed on wall, otherwise it got a big facial. A flower. Make this together just until incorporated 'cause remember you never want to over mix, otherwise you'll get really tough tough cookies. This is perfectly combined. Now I'm going to add in my chocolate chips and I have two cups here of semisweet chocolate chips and justice. Send it to combine. And then we use our spatula to do the rest of the work. Scrape everything down and don't want to leave anything behind. And here we go. Makes this really well. You want to make sure that nothing got left behind at the bottom. Make sure you Preheat your oven to 375 at this point, 'cause you want to make sure it's nice and hot and with a small ice cream scoop. We're actually. This was actually called a cookie scooper. It really is, and it makes it perfect size cookies all the same size and it works every time. Take non stick baking sheet or cookie sheet. Whichever you have, don't grease it. There's plenty of butter in there to make sure it doesn't stick and just take. Nice little boy and here we go. Play some a couple inches apart from each other because they will expand. And justice keep on scooping them. Last cooking now. As you can see got lots of cookies in front of me and have some really happy guests tomorrow and these are going to go into your preheated 375 and eight to 10 minutes. Keep an eye on them. You want them to just be lightly brown around the edges, and then you're gonna leave them on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes before transferring them onto a cooling rack. There you have them guys on these baked for 10 minutes. I let them cool in the baking pan baking sheets for about 10 minutes and I put them on a cooling rack to cool completely for half an hour before putting them in a beautiful platter and these are not your average, doughy, thick, dense cookie. This is a lighter than air crisp, but yes still soft, chocolaty, delicious heavenly. Cookie now please go to my website at www.lieinthekitchen.com to get the full recipe. Make these and please let me know what you think and. I'm going to carry on with me so see you guys. Next time. Bye bye."

We had it for dessert at dinner parties like these brownies are always ahead. Hi, I'm Alexis Tabatchnick and today I'm going to show you how to make my one bowl fudgy brownie recipe from my upcoming cookbook to the last fight. There's walnuts, there's salt. It's fudgy, sweet, savory. It's really my perfect brownie. First, I like to line the pan with parchment paper. It just looks easy to bring them out of the tray. Place the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and microwave it in 32nd intervals just until the chocolate is melted. Now that the chocolate is melted, you're going to add the melted butter and use a hand mixer to beat until just combined. Now add the sugar combine again. Alternatively, you can do this in a stand mixer or even by hand. Add vanilla extract and eggs. And once again, be until combined. Add kosher salt and flour and just carefully combine, making sure not to overbeat the batter. These are really fudgy brownies. They've got an incredible texture. I add some walnuts for a bit of crunch and some flaky sea salt on top so you're really balancing that sweet savory flavor profile. But if you don't like walnuts or have an allergy, you can use another type of nut. Pour the brownie batter into the pan and then use the spatula to smooth the top. Pop them in the oven and they're going to bake for 25 minutes. I like to top my brownies with some flaky sea salt, but it's really important that you let them cool for at least 30 minutes. You just lift them out of the pan. Slice away and enjoy. One of the reasons I love these brownies is that it's all done in one bowl. Easy to make easy, clean up. What could be better than that? This is just one recipe in my upcoming cookbook to the last bite. It comes out April 19th and there's over 100 recipes, many of which were inspired by my childhood like these brownies. Ooh. They're fudgy, they're sweet, they're salty, the perfect texture. I really hope you make these brownies. Oh Oh yes."

https://www.youtube.com/c/buzzfeedtasty","Gumbo is in my heart, it's in my soul. I grew up in New Orleans, LA and in my family gumbo. Season starts around Thanksgiving time. It has served for every major holiday leading all the way up to Mardi Gras and sometimes a little bit afterwards. What makes gumbo extra special to me is it's diverse roots. The dishes over 300 years old and has several cultural influences from all over from the Caribbean, France, Germany and Native Americans, but many believe its origins are in the West African cuisine, the word gumbo. Actually derives from the word for okra in some West African languages, and his use of rice also indicates its ties directly to Africa. Rice was brought over during the transatlantic slave trade and became a highly cultivated crop in America. There's no right or wrong way to make gumbo. Well, there definitely is the wrong way to make gumbo, but today the version we're making is going to have you falling in love with gumbo done the right way. So let's jump into the kitchen and make some gumbo. Baby, so today we're making seafood philic gumbo and it all starts with a homemade stock. Now you can buy chicken, seafood, vegetable or even beef stop, but people will look at you a little funny if you put beef stock in your gumbo. But hey, we're not here to judge. However, most families make their own stock at home using the vegetable scraps and the seafood scraps to make it from scratch. We start with heating up some oil in a heavy bottom 5 quart pot over medium heat. Once it's hot will add 3 Blue Crabs. You can find bluku these crabs in the Gulf of Mexico. There's definitely something magical going on in those murky waters that make them taste. Amazing, so don't use Dungeness or stone crabs. Trust me it won't taste the same. Let these guys cook until their shells turn a bright orange. Then we'll add shrimp shells with their heads. These will make for a far more superior stock. Will Cook these until the shells turn pink. Now it's time to smash the shells. It's similar to mashing potatoes. Doing this is going to help release all those extra juices so really get in there and take out your daily frustration. And finally, we'll add some vegetable scraps. And some seasoning cover this all with water and bring it to a slight bar. Then bring it down to a simmer for at least 30 to 35 minutes. Now will strain it and set it to the side. You see making your own homemade stock isn't that hard, and I know you smell the difference. Next, we'll move on to our own seasoning. We're going to make our own Creole Cajun blend, and if you ever get a blend from someone else, make sure that they're from southern Louisiana. I'm talking New Orleans, Opelousas, Lafayette. Baton Rouge or the surrounding areas outside has put weird stuff like chili powder and cumin in it. That's a big no no babe. We don't do that around here. I'll blend is a combination of kosher salt, white pepper, black pepper, cayenne paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, and oregano will whisk all of these together in the bowl. Man, it is starting to smell like home. Now we're ready to start cooking this gumbo. Now grab a large pot, place it over medium high heat and add in some canola oil. Cook this until it reaches a smoke point. You're looking for a faint white smoke. Anything thicker is going to burn our roof. The smoke is so faint the camera couldn't even capture it, so pay real close attention. This next step can be controversial. We're going to add in some okra. Not all families add okra to their feet, their gumbo, but some people believe a gumbo without okra just isn't Gumbel. We're team okra over Hill Fridays for a couple of minutes until they turn Army green. This will remove all the slide. You don't need to. Eat slimy okra after a few minutes removed him from the pot and drained him on a paper towel. Let's move on to the roof. This is my favorite part right here. Besides, eating a room is a mixture of flour and fat that's used as a thickener in all sorts of recipes. From Fancy Mac and cheese to soups and stews. Rules can be a variety of shades from blonde to dark. Brown gumbo requires a dark brown rule, so we're using the oil for this. Typically, it takes about 30 to 45 minutes to get that kind of root, but I'm gonna teach you a technique. To get that dog brown rule in five minutes. Yeah, I said 5 minutes will turn up our heat and get it back to that perfect smoke point. Remember, we're looking for a faint white smoke heating the oil before adding the flour will fry the flower quickly, giving it that classic nutty flavor. Whisk the flour until it turns a dark cocoa brown. If the rule is Browning too fast, remove the pot off the heat while continuously stirring and reduce the heat to medium low look. You didn't believe me, huh? A beautiful, perfect cocoa brown root. In five minutes. So next we'll add Onion, Bell pepper and celery. This vegetable trio is known as the Holy Trinity. This is the backbone of Creole, Cajun cooking. 2 TBSP. About seasoning blend we're going to stir this for two to three minutes and then add some garlic Bay leaves and the rest of our seasoning blend. You want to add your seasoning in layers to add depth of flavor to your gumbo. Turn up the heat to medium high and gradually at the seafood stop. If you don't have a whisk, stirring in different directions will break up. Any clumps we want a nice smooth gumbo. Don't nobody have time for no lumpy gumbo? Then it's time to add our okra, smoke, sausage, crabs, time and Worcestershire sauce. Now there's a variety of proteins you can add to your gumbo. Personally, we love to smoke sausage, crab and shrimp combo. Typically you don't add chicken to your seafood gumbo, but hey, do what makes you feel great. If you don't like seafood or have an allergy, you can simply go with a chicken and sausage gumbo, which is also known as gumbo Yaya. Alright, now let's bring our mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to a low simmer for one hour. Uncovered. Your house is about to smell like a New Orleans grandmother's house. Skim off any foam residue that rises to the top. This is just the flower cooking out. Nothing weird. After about an hour, your gumbo should have thickened and reduced bowel quarter. We are in the home stretch now, but before we get to that last step, we're going to take a quick taste just to make sure it's season properly. So delicious. Then we'll add our shrimp. And remove our pot from the heat. The gumbo is going to be so hot that the shrimp will cook in 10 minutes. Now it's time to eat there, but call your family over and get a bowl. We love to serve our gumbo over rice. Some people like more rice than gumbo. Others like it 5050 I'm a more gumbo than rice guy. Do what you love. Garnish with parsley, green onions and finish it off with some filet powder. Filet powder is ground sassafras leaves. This is the Native American part of the dish. It's going to add that final distinct layer of flavor that can only be found in Philly. Let me tell you now. This is a bowl full of love, flavor, family heritage, memories and everything else that's good and lovely in the world. I hope you love sharing a piece of my family history with your own family. Check out the recipe on tasty.co and let us know if you make this delicious seafood feel. Egg gumbo baby? Oh yes."

https://www.youtube.com/c/buzzfeedtasty","When it comes to grilled cheese, do you believe less is more or more is more high? I am Nemo. I'm a culinary producer at Dusty. Today. I'm going to test recipes for a 3/6 and 12 ingredient. Grilled cheese. May the best grilled cheese win. First up, we're making our green gradient grilled cheese for the first ingredient we are going to start with bread. I decided to go with brioche because it's buttery and fluffy was a hint of sweetness. Our next ingredient is butter. Everything is better with butter, and since we only can use. Three ingredients we want to make them count. We are going to generously butter one side of the bread and place it on a hot skillet, and for our third and final ingredient we are adding sliced American cheese and we have picked American cheese because it's such a classic top. The bread was three slices of American cheese. These the other slice of bread on top, butter side up. When the bottom slice of bread is golden brown, flip and continue cooking until the other side has browned and the cheese is fully melted. And there we have it. Our classic 3 ingredient grilled cheese bread, butter, cheese that really might be all you need. I guess we will have to wait and see. Next up we have our six ingredient grilled cheese. Our first ingredients are the same as our last version and those are bread and butter for this version we choose sourdough bread because we are looking for a bread that's Hardy with a little bit of a tank. After we spread the butter on one side of each slice of bread, we are going to place them. But our slide down. And now it's time to introduce our new ingredients. Ingredient #3 is grated garlic. I mean, think about it. This is basically becoming a garlic bread. Grilled cheese, which sounds like a dream come true. Ingredient, #4 is pesto. We tried many different options for seasonings and condiments, but what we realized is that pesto is the best way to bring the flavor home. Now it's time for cheese. We are going to pick two different types of cheese, mozzarella and sharp provolone. We're using two types of cheese because mozzarella is creamy while sharp revelon will give our sandwich a nutty flavor, and you're probably noticing that these steps are in a bit of a different order than last time. For the three ingredient grilled cheese we just built the sandwich right onto the skillet, but because we have more ingredients this time around, we are building our entire Sanders first to ensure even cooking throughout. After cooking for about 5 minutes on each side. Our sandwich is a beautiful golden brown and. Our cheese is nice melted time to eat. Look at that ooey gooey goodness. Let's get started on the 12 ingredient grilled cheese. Our first ingredient is, of course, butter. We're going to melt one tablespoon of butter in a small skillet, then add in 1/4 cup of sliced yellow onions and a pinch of salt. Yep, I said onions. Make sure to stir your onions often until they're soft and starting to caramelize. Caramelizing onions usually takes up to 40 minutes. But since we're using a very small quantity, we're cutting hours back to 10 minutes. Next, add in a generous amount of brown sugar and continue cooking the onions until the sugar starts to caramelize. Oddball samic glaze and stir fry cooking these beautiful carmalized onions. We will add in some sweetness to our final dish. Next up ingredient number six time in a small pot combined, the rest of your butter and the time to create a delicious infused butter. This simple hack is going to be. A game changer. We're going to brush our infused butter and two ingredient #7 our bread. For this recipe we went with artisanal country bread with a thick crust and a coarse texture, this time infused butter will take our bread to the next level. That is why we're brushing a generous amount on both sides. Now it's time to fry. Everyone has their own grilled cheese preference, but I think we can all agree that we want the bread to be golden brown and crispy. Now we're going to start assembly. This is definitely way more work than the average grilled cheese, but trust us, the outcome will totally be worth it. Ingredient #8, horris ground Dijon mustard. Spread the mustard evenly on both slices of bread, Next up, aged cheddar. We're going to add the shredded cheese next ham. This is not just a ham and cheese sandwich. This is an upgraded grilled cheese. Our next cheeses grayer, grayer. Is Rich quimi and salty while the aged cheddar is sharp on our other slice of bread at the carmalized onions. Sandwich it up before we throw this back on the heat, let's sprinkle the pan with our 12th and final ingredient Parmesan cheese. We will then carefully place our sandwich on top of the Parmesan cheese, while the Parmesan cheese melts and crisps up to create a crust. We're going to top the other side of our sandwich with the rest of the Parmesan. This is my favorite hog to get our bread nice and crispy which will really make a difference in the final sandwich. Since both slices of bread are a beautiful color and our cheese is melted, it's time to plate. Here we have it. Our 12 ingredient grilled cheese. Not only do we have a creamy, cheesy and terrier, but we have a crispy Parmesan crust, sweet carmelized onions and a cake from the mustard and there we have it. Our three ingredient 6 ingredient. And 12 ingredient grilled cheese. When picking my favorite sandwich between the three, I had to consider flavor, texture, and with sandwich I would want to eat again. I love how easy and classic the three in greeting, grilled cheeses, and the pesto and cheese combo in the 6th grade and grilled cheese tasted so great. But at the end of the day I keep going back for more bites of the 12 ingredient grilled cheese. Thanks for joining me as I tests our favorite 3. Grilled cheese sandwiches. Let us know how you make your favorite girl cheese at home bye."

https://www.youtube.com/c/buzzfeedtasty","Alright. Hey guys, it's me Jasmine. We're here at Sushi Ginza Onodera 2 Michelin star restaurant. We're going to speak with Chef Yohei and he's going to show us a little bit about aging fish, a super super traditional process that dates back to 200 years ago. Let's go check it out. Like a hearty in my mouth. Americans are obsessed with fresh sushi. We want the fish to be caught, prepared and placed on our plate, all on the same day. But in order for that delectable piece of Toro to go from boats to tongue, it has to travel a long way. So how do you preserve that fresh taste that we all crave? Well by freezing it? Minus. Should you close? Email no, no, I know I know means of and doing better today and all. Minuscule. Camel go downstairs. Music video. Your momma. Could you do? I know what you know, America. Basketball. So that's the minimum. Maybe you know. How was she did? Constantly I know. He got kicked. I know it's OK. Channel you guys both Siddiqi mascara and associated condo and secondhand. Come on now. Managed. Money or. It is not. There are many ways to age fish, but the four main techniques in edomae sushi, R1, kombucha salted seaweed marinade 2 show Yuzuki a soy sauce, marinade 3 of pickling vinegar, marinade and four nimono cooking the fish. First seaweed is rehydrated using sake until soft. Then the filet assaulted and wrapped in the seaweed like a blanket, then left to age for four days. ******* is a white fish with similar texture to the puffer fish. Cookies. Remind me this sounds so good there's like a bounce to it like Christmas every 30 seconds. The salmon is quickly poached in a bath of hot water and cooled in an ice bath to prevent cooking all the way through. Then the filet is placed in a marinade of homemade soy sauce, mirin, and dashi, then aged for one night. Melts in my mouth and I know it's aged but it just tastes so so fresh. Thank you so much. After the fish is Fillide, it's placed in a strong salt water bath for 10 minutes to remove that strong fishy smell. The skin is torched very slightly and placed in a bowl of vinegar for 30 minutes. After the skin is scored and topped with original Japanese tiger shrimp powder. Thomas well, we got some. Ability. I don't even know how to describe that like a party in my mouth. Enjoy. The illness believed, then placed in hot water to remove slime on the skin. Then it's cooked in a soup base for 30 minutes. This soup based is kept and used over again, each time enriching the flavor and thickness of the broth. So different yes, but so delicious. Simple. Do you not gonna kill going? Psychological process. Soon as she made it. Store. Visit. During that time. I'm assuming. Taking in the entire process, it doesn't just start. Here. Starts with the fisherman and then you come in prep and do all this beautiful stuff in between. And you say that the process ends with the customer eating it. It's like a whole story and you were saying how it's like an open book. We see everything, so seeing the love and care that goes into each single piece of fish, I think that really makes it that sets it apart from everything. You eat, you eat the money this."

https://www.youtube.com/c/buzzfeedtasty","Welcome to sugar lot. Here in the Arts district in downtown Los Angeles. I'm Calvin hassle. I'm Megan Bozeman, I'm William who and were Co. Founders of Sugar Log and we create 3D printed food experiences. We created Sugar Lab over 10 years ago when we invented a new kind of 3D printer that prints with dehydrated food powders. It's been our brainchild since then. Our labor of love and we're proud to share them. We 3D print with real food everything that we print with is something that's Chef would source. And it's all edible and safe to eat. 3D printing with food is incredible because it does a couple of things really, really well. It creates food in incredible precision. We need to reprint with a lot of geometric corners and symmetry that aren't able to be done by hand. You can do things with 3D printed food that complement traditional, but also do things that are not even possible. One of the challenges with 3D printed food is that people have never had it before it's been. Fun challenge to figure out what we should offer to people right now. Let's go upstairs to check out the design process. So this is the strawberry bond bond. We sketched it out first and now I'm just roughing out the shape of it and then now I'm going to start placing the seeds and we can do this really precisely on this software. We love that our food can look like the actual food that we're designing and also we can play off that by changing the whole experience of actually eating that fruit. And that's important to us, because this is already a new product and we wanted to make it super familiar, but also change that experience which people weren't really expecting. And now we have a kitchen out here. Where Chef Victoria does her magic. Hi, my name is Victoria Rose Johnson. I am the kitchen manager and resident pastry chef here. I have so much fun I get to make incredible things and beautiful things that when I was younger I used to love baking cakes and that led to me going to the Culinary Institute of America. I landed here and now. This is what I get to do. I have always been interested in the decorating aspect and there are limitations when it comes to making things that are fondant and buttercream. But there are no limitations here. And it's absolutely amazing. One of my favorites is our love and hex potions. These are glitter bombs which are absolutely amazing. The process for printing it absolutely has to begin with measuring out all of your ingredients. What I'm about to make is our kimchi buyan, one of our savory items that we make. I'm gonna start with our neutral powder. This is the one that doesn't have any additional flavor. It basically tastes very similar to powdered sugar. Next, I know this looks exactly the same, but it is actually our lime powder. One of my favorite. Parts is our beautiful beautiful gochugaru. We have to make it super super fine so that there's no chance that the particle size is too big. It could fail a print if the particle size were too big or it wouldn't spread right in the printer, which of course is no fun for anybody next year. I have the celery salt that helps bring in that green flavor that you aren't going to get with powdered sugar and then last but not least is our regular salt again. Or find Super super fine. All of those get mixed into a big bowl that then gets. Brought over to the printer when we're ready to shift into the printer, I start by finding the correct file on the little computer that's attached to the printer. I make sure I heighten the feed and the build bed now the feed bed is where the powder is gonna go before it starts printing and the build bed is where the powder is going to end up. It moves from one to the other and that's that's basically part of the printing process, so I will pull it up right here and I will get these to their right heights, and then we're ready to go. It is a weird feeling that most of my job as a chef. Is playing with technology and yes, it is always this messy after I have everything shifted in. I gotta make sure that all those little loose particles that got around the edges get into the print itself. Now we gotta grab the Tampa. I like doing a little tap at the end to get all of the excess off. Now we're going to have to smooth this guy out. So let's bring these up to the right height. This is going to pull the powder across and make that really nice flat top so that we have a good printing base. And of course while the base itself is a sugar mixture. It gets bound with a water based ink similar to how you would use food coloring and other things, and there she is. Flat, beautiful and ready for printing. When I go to activate, essentially push down the feed bed, which is where the powder came from and I pushed up the build bed just a little bit so I have access to the parts. Next I just grab them so we of course really, really carefully pull them out and we set them up on these little trees here, so this blue is going to come out really, really gorgeous when we do powder, which is a fun little machine. It's extremely loud, which is really convenient for singing songs. When I'm alone in the kitchen. It is not, however, convenient when I'm singing songs really loud in the kitchen and don't hear my coworkers walk through the door. They're all ready to go after that. These have a nice neutral flavor and they are blue toned. It's not the only color that we do. We also do an orange hombre as well as some other beautiful rainbow cubes. These are most commonly used in tea or coffee. Anything you want just a little bit sweeter. Neutral is not the only flavor we make. We also do things like watermelon lemonade and lime. We do things as crazy as Mexican hot chocolate and cinnamon. It's not as sweet as I thought it would be, which is really nice. I think it's like a refreshing level of sweetness, so these are the strawberry covered chocolate truffles. They have an incredible ginger shell. The red one is filled with a carmalized, honey and chili. Then we also have the pink one here which is a tamarind, elderflower and then the last one. Here is our white one and it is a pineapple upside down cake. These are some of my favorites. They're the original recipes. That we made very, very, very beginning. I am getting ready to fill here. I've got my ganache I've got my little truffles over here we make a ton of different truffles. The flavor I have here is tamarind elderflower. All of the ganache gets made in house. Each one of these is hand filled by me. Cheers. You guys have to try this Michelle. Every time I think it's going to break my teeth, it doesn't. It's so soft, got the perfect bite. Oddly enough, our best seller is one of our savory items that we make and it is our kimchi buyan which is an absolutely wonderful recipe that we make that ends up tasting like kimchi. And you can put it in your room and the million different things you can do with it. So it's both surprising and not surprising that it's our top seller. Woo, it tastes like elevated cup noodles. There's so many great memories over the course of the last decade. With Sugar Lab, we've had a ton of really special projects that came to us from excited chefs who wanna make something super custom or even just from people. All the Casa country or who are hosting birthday parties get togethers. We have a custom wedding line. We also make cake toppers for weddings and they're super cool. We work with bakers locally here in LA and one of the really neat things we can do is 3D scan a bride or groom. And render them in 3D and then 3D printed directly into sugar and you have your own likeness in the 3D printed sugar. It's made from our friends over at action Face. They have an iPhone app. You download it in 3D, scan yourself and then send us the file and we get it 3D printed. Speaking of figurines we made one of you Jasmine Oh my gosh. It's me, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen. Let's eat it. Cheers. It tastes like cake with the texture of meringue. This is crazy all that hard work the printer did and I'm just eating it. This is the neutral one, so it tastes like sugar and it's really nicely flavored at the end of the day. We all love food and we wanted 3D printed food to be a part of everyone's life."

Full Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/1-dollar-gourmet-quesadilla-but-cheaper","I get it. OK city is cheap but boring. Why don't have a gourmet version like you would get at a restaurant for this price? Right here that is but cheaper. Hey pal, you live in LA. You want to try my food great Friday, April 1st Amboy. Here's the location. There will be a link in the description for the location as well be there from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM be there or be square now back to our quesadilla. Look 99.99% of the time. I always recommend making your own tortillas. OK, but look store bought tortilla and the crappy shredded cheese put together in a pan has this weird nostalgia for me. I don't know why probably because of my childhood. OK, I ate a lot of them. They're great, well order. Could they be a lot better with meats and different cheeses and homemade tortillas? And does that make it worth it all that time and effort? I think the answer is yes, but we have one way to find out. So let's make this shall we, right? So let's begin with the one we all know. Find your worst store bought flour tortillas. Vegan find, which included properly aren't horrifying. I'll be it. Still lame in comparison to homemade but fill that bad boy with any regular old pre shredded Fiesta cheese, which is a vague term that doesn't really have a definition. If there is one thing I really dislike in cheese aside from blue it's pre shredded anti caking agents tried texture, lackluster flavor in comparison to fresh grated. But I digress at that 1/2 of your tortilla folded over at about a tablespoon of butter then adding your folded tortilla in a non stick pan and toast for about 2 minutes. Flip and toast for another one to two minutes. Out of being about a boom, it's a finished quesadilla. Beautifully fast, surprisingly nice cheese ball and, well, it's unfussy to make, but don't taste us this bad boy in a second, but only alongside our much more gourmet version offer this price right here. To make that, we must first begin with our tortillas. It's simple and it totals out of this price for eight big boy tortillas, but you can always make him smaller and have more meaning. Besides bowl, add 2 cups or 330 grams of all purpose flour and one teaspoon or 4 grams of fine sea salt, half TSP or two grams of baking powder. What's together until combined separately at 1/4 cup. 462 grams of vegetable oil now stop well Josh, why don't we add lard if you know anything about the tortilla world, please stop yourself. The oil helps add a ton of very desirable chew, so don't substitute this thing. You're being smart, love you now mix that into 3/4 of a cup or 180 milliliters of hot water. Then mix that into your flour mixture, stirring with a fork until you get a rough dough. Then just need by hand for two to three minutes until you get a sub. Cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes. Oh, and don't forget to give it some life. Very nice Josh. Now cooking tortillas is even easier. We have a large cast iron skillet dry over medium high heat. This isn't hot enough. You were going to get the opposite of a kiss. Now separate your dough into 8 even pieces. All those pieces in ticket circles, about 9 inches wide and it's a little under a quarter inch thick, so it should be quite thin Julia tortilla into your hot pan. Let it cook and char for about 15 seconds. If it's hot enough reminder, then flip and let it finish for another 15 to 20 seconds on the other side place and a towel to keep warm and repeat. All of your lovely tortillas, and now for the filling. Let's make this easy. Medium sized casteren pantele hotter than me. Dancing with very tight pants on out 1/2 cup or 227 grams of high fat ground beef. That means something that's like less than 80% lean. We want the fat OK cook and mash that stirring occasionally for four minutes or until the beef has rendered out. Its fat is fully cooked and starting to develop. Little crispy boys like this. Then add 3 cloves of garlic. Didn't Lee sliced 1 jalapeno diced half a yellow onion, diced and seasoned. Taste with salt and pepper and saute until the vegetables are softened and starting to caramelize, about 3 minutes. Make sure those salt levels are nice and then you have your birth for the sauce simply makes a quarter cup or 55 grams of sour cream, 1/4 cup or 55 grams of salsa Verde or any salsa of choice. Really, this is actually a recipe from another video which you can find the link in the description and 1/2 cup or 30 grams of very finely chopped cilantro. Season that lightly with salt and that's your salsa crema. Now last, but far from least. The cheese mix in a bowl, mix together. 2 cups are 120 grams of grated cheddar cheese and 1 cup or 60 grams of grated Monterey Jack toss, toss, toss and that's your cheese mix. C very simple. Now assembling is the same. Take one of your homemade tortillas, opened up flat and on one side had a couple spoonfuls of your salsa crema. Spread it around on just half, then a small layer of cheese, followed by a small layer of beef and you guessed it, another layer of cheese. You should always double cheese. It's a quesadilla, OK? Then fold it into a Half Moon at a tablespoon of unsalted butter to a nonstick pan. He never medium heat. Let it melt, and once it's hot and. And your quesadilla, and let it toast for about 2 minutes. Flip and toast for another two minutes, until all of your cheese is melted and you got a beautifully brown quesadilla. Pop it out, cut it, and experience a cheese pull that opens up the threads of time. You can nearly look through it and see the happiness of your future self. It's a beautiful thing. Now let's actually taste this and see if it far surpasses the value of the OG quesadilla, right? So we have two different versions. This is not about better, it's just a comparison of two cheap versions. One more gourmet, all handmade and one that just kind of store bought put together. This one right here and then. This one. Visually, the homing tortilla looks artisanal. It's got that sort of crusty. It almost looks like a really nice flatbread. This one is much more crisp. Don't believe me? So there's this version. Honestly, there's a certain level of nostalgia for that, right? We all know that store bought flour tortilla flavor. It just goes so well with the crappy pre grated cheese now. I don't care what anyone says, the flavor increases so dramatically larger. There is no comparison whatsoever. If you want something different that is worth remembering and making again, this is the quesadilla for you for this price right here. That is a proper but cheaper gourmet K Cydia brother. You know what else gets my cheese oozing B roll? OK, so we made our two different quesadillas. Of course the original 1 still tasted good. I'm not here to tell you that that doesn't taste good. So before you get in the comments. Oh my God Josh, I really like it when I make it like that. I'm not sure I remember. I don't give a don't go in the corner. I bet your wall smells like old stale cheese. But the alternative version that we made that was so much more in flavor depth, meaning heart and for still a low price, are you kidding me brother? So if you have passion and love left in you after all these years, then you're going to want to make that quesadilla take it or leave it, pal."

Full Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/making-authentic-hot-pot-at-home-2-ways","This isn't a soup. It's not a rice bowl, not a noodle bowl. This is an eating experience of a lifetime. So today we're making hot pot heavily misunderstood, and oftentimes I feel like people just don't take the time to go and try it. Why the beauty of hot pot is you got your bra. Oftentimes there's two, there's a spicy and a regular, and you have all sorts of accoutrement you can mix and match however you want, and I've said this before. I'm single handedly one of the most indecisive diners you can possibly imagine. I will order far more than I need and spend far more than I have to just so I can try everything. It's its own problem, but this dish singlehandedly solves that for me and it'll solve it for you too. So let's make this shall we? OK, I don't want you getting your pants all in a bunch and think this is going to be super complicated. There's a lot of ingredients, but we can simplify it here. Basically, this consists of two broths, a very clean and light tasting broth on one side, and a nice umami rich and beautifully spicy version on the other. Then you have a multitude of. Put them in dipping sauces to create an eating experience unique to you and your heart. Speaking of that, let's speaking with the heart of this recipe. This stock we're keeping this basic OK, no salt yet. This is just the base of the recipe to a stock pot. Add five large chicken drumsticks and five large bone in and skin on chicken thighs. One bunch of green onion, one inch number of ginger, sliced one whole head of garlic, cut in half, then add just enough water to cover and that should be at least 5 quarts. Bring them to light, boil over medium high heat and reduced to a simmer. Then just let that lightly simmer for one and a half to two hours or until you get a lovely light colored stock. It has a beautifully cleaned but flavorful taste. Strain that bad boy and you have a stock for the base of Egypt soup. Now, typically when you make each broth, you'll also see a store bought soup base. More specifically for the spicy version. But what about your own homemade instant soup base that just say one boil anytime you want two blender? Add 2 tablespoons or 7 grams of red Sichuan peppercorns, 2 tablespoons are 7 grams of green Sichuan peppercorns 3 star **** also pronounced a nice two Cinnamon, 6 slightly charged with a torch or boiler gold and lightly crushed. Blend until is fine as possible. The high speed blender like this helps a lot. Now in a meeting spot out of 1 1/2 cups for 308 grams of beef fat, AKA tallow. Half a cup or 120 milliliters of vegetable oil heated over medium heat just until the beef at his melted. Then that in one pint or 55 grams of dried chili pods seated. These are heaven facing Chili's, but you could also use chili to TBL or dried Korean chilies. Let this gently fry for one to two minutes or until beautifully crisp and lightly darkened. Straining oil into a heatproof container, then place the strained oil back into the pot with the Chili's cool for about 30 seconds, then put them in your blender and blend their brother on high until very fine. Now to your warm oil at a mixture of eight cloves of finely chopped garlic 5 green onion, sliced thin. A 300 of ginger, peeled and finely chopped, then turn on the medium heat and sweat for one minute or just until fragrant, that half a cup or 105 grams of doubanjiang. Also called spicy bean paste. Yes, I know pronunciation blows, but guess what? The flavor does, not 3 tablespoons are 65 grams of fermented black bean paste, 5 Bay leaves, 2 tablespoons are 25 grams of dried chitake mushroom powder, which is exactly what you think. Dried chitake mushrooms blended powder. Super easy. Your spice mix from earlier and once it starts to bubble. Got your blended fried chilies and the cook, stirring occasionally for seven to 10 minutes or until it becomes a very dark red. Now carefully remove all your beliefs and finally add one tablespoon or 15 grams of Greenwood and sugar two to half teaspoons or 11 grams of. So that in in last add 3 tablespoons or 35 grams of Shaoxing Rice, one cook for one more minute, then add everything tool blender and blend until as smooth as possible. At high speed. I'll tell you right now you ain't gonna do much blending if it ain't on high, put that mixture into an 8 by 8 baking pan. Spread it out evenly and optionally top with a couple whole dried red chili pods. This is more for visuals. Then cover that, place it in the fridge and cool until completely solid. Then just divide that into four to six pieces depending on how spicy you want your soup base and that is literally an instantized soup base that really can be used. In any context, your heart desires, mix it in rice, put it in another soup, melted and mashed potatoes. I mean, is ridiculous. Tell you what believe it or not. We're actually ready to assemble. Look, this isn't but cheaper. So if you want to have this thing that makes a hot pot special AKA 2 sided hot pot, place in the middle of the. Now, Phil Bull says if you're hot pot with your stock, turn that bad boy on a medium high and 1st. Let's start with our non spicy side at 4 Roger talky mushrooms. A pinch of ground white pepper. Three or four Chinese jujubee, a 2 inch knob of ginger, peeled and sliced 4 green onion, sliced in 2 inch segments and then on the other side. Guess what? Literally just one block of your spicy soup base. Drop it in, let it dissolve and the obelisk of flavor will do the rest. Then just using both sides to taste with salt. From here it's real basic. You need a coot that rings your Binky. I've got £2.00 of mini bok choy cleaned and quartered. Some trumpet mushrooms sliced one container of Beech mushrooms with their bottoms cut off Napa cabbage, halved and cut into large strips and for the starch we've got Chinese style noodles but hang on. Maybe you toss in some dumplings or mix and match and have some rice cakes. You know whatever floats your soup boat for the meat, you can use anything you want, but I recommend getting a tray of pre sliced shabu, shabu beef and maybe simply sliced Wagyu beef as well. Typically I'll do 2 to £3.00 for four people and you can find all this stuff at a local Asian grocery store. That being said last but not least very very important, the dipping sauces of course. Spicy chili oil DA but also. Sesame garlic oil, which is comprised of three tablespoons or 28 grams of sesame oil. 3 cloves of garlic, grated and a generous pinch of Smokey, flaky salt mix and well, that's it for vinegar soy. It's literally just three tablespoons or 40 grams of soy sauce mixed with three tablespoons are 40 grams of Chinese black vinegar. Can't forget rice, you know it has a home in pretty much all meals and look at that. You got your veg, your starch, your dipping sauces, meats, hot steamy simmering Lee, Mommy rich broth ready to call the Cowboys home, tears of joy in your eyes and happiness welling up in your heart. Let's give this a little breakdown on how to eat this. And see what this is truly all about. Wow, this is one of my most favorite eating experiences. It's beautiful. My biggest thing is I always wanna taste a bunch of things when I go out to eat. Oftentimes, I order far more than I need to, and I don't care 'cause I wanna try it. All hot pot supplies. All of those experiences in one. There should be at least 100 combinations here. Below meeting here. Put in there. Put meat in here and there and there put me in here and then in there. But then put a little noodle in there and then in there with the meeting here. It's tailored to exactly what you want. You should make sure every bite is different. One for the meat. Biggest tip when you dip your meat. When you dip, your meat needs to be quick. I'm talking 15 to 20 seconds, it'll keep it juicy and moist. Please don't leave it in there and let it get obliterated. Alright, I got a little bit of rice. The rice wasn't cooked in here but all the different ingredients are permeating the rice. They're dropping their fats and their juices and their oils and their salts sort of perfuming this rice with the essence of all these hot pot flavors. Pretty sure rice flew out of my mouth. We gotta replay. If you caught that, I don't know if my dumplings cooked all the way through, but I hope it is so good. The benefit of cooking something like a dumpling or noodles in here. It absorbs all this flavor. Is that what we all want? It is about God. You wouldn't know what else has meat dipped in a hot, steamy bath B roll. Isn't that, is it? So we made our hot. It's one of those things that every time you make it, you're like wow. This is so much better than I imagined it to me. And it's not like you didn't expect it to be great. It is that much better. There are plenty of recipes you can make where you eat something and it's like, yeah, this is good. It's like not blowing me away but it's like good, I'm enjoying it and I would make this again. But this far surpasses that only because of its customisability. It's different every time you eat it's never one hot pot meal. It's exactly the same. The juicy dripping meat, it's spicy, it's salty, little bit of sweet. It's an endless car ride journey through Flavortown and you're the driver. So with all that being said, if you enjoyed this video don't suddenly like subscribing a lot of them. I'll see you next time, bye."

Full Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/making-butter-chicken-faster-than-a-restaurant-but-faster","Today we're making the fastest butter chicken, let's begin. But faster this series, where we find a way to make your favorite foods as fast as we possibly can. Today, we're making butter chicken, someone's gonna order it going, get it and I'm gonna make it before they get back start your engines, place your orders and let's make this shall we butter chicken recipe on the website. We should probably be counting the time that it takes for them to order. 'cause technically that takes time to look. I'm right, washing my race so there's no race in there. You always make time for washing your rice water. In I used to pressure cooker on the last episode, which taught me a lesson. This is the one way to make rice really fast. OK manual, put it for three minutes. I've never had butter chicken, not one time to be honest. I just found out what it looks like. I think I would like it. OK, we're gonna cut our chicken to bite sized pieces. What does that mean? Are you able to bite? It does not. That's not a good reason. So single stroke slices make this a lot faster, but you gotta have a sharp knife so in here. Kashmiri chilli turmeric the recipes on the website that was cumin that's Gary Masala salt. And finally we're gonna add some ginger taking too much time. This weekend take time for. Normally you'd let this marinate, but do you think we have time for that? We can kind of find out what happens when we skip some of these standardized processes, 'cause I normally marinate this, so I'm curious how this will affect the recipe. Should I drive faster if it's bus faster in yeah? On y'all we're gonna cut our onion. Onions are done. Oh look, the sons here. OK garlic, good old fashioned slice that just done. You need a pan but a deep one makes sense. OK? Turn it up. Always use G whenever you're making butter chicken please. I think I should give me a flash costume and go go pick up the food in flash costume like this. Oh my God. OK problem solved. Just waiting for this to melt. Oh wow, this guy smells great. I've said this several times on this channel having everything near you right. I've got my tools behind me down here. Having that stuff near you having all your pots pans associated with your movements at is the key to your speed. OK, we're coming up to temp. We can have a little jazz moment. Yeah, why is my character wins again? I'm going to switch the car mode to the sports mode. We're on ECON mode right now. Saving gas. We're starting to smoke here. I'm gonna add my cheeky on oh I see the problem. This induction is only heating the center of it and not the outside of it, so that's good. That'll be really helpful for this. And by helpful I mean literally not at all helpful. So that victim, you like that wafting into my poles. I'm gonna overcrowd the pan right now because I'm in a hurry. Don't do this another waiting period. Like jazz moment. You know, I feel like we're losing right now. Could be the weather. Not feeling like a winner right now. We got some nice color going on here. We need a little bit of water area of effect here just to get her started. I'm flipping the chicken, yeah yeah yeah, I'm a little concerned with the fact that only the center was hot. It turns out just this circle heat stuff. I should have known that exit right here. It's crunch time. What can I use to press this? Walla, I don't wanna keep flipping it over and over and over 'cause we're gonna finish it in the simmer, right? So we're weighing it all down with this flat events here. Hopefully that works. Let's get the vibe. Check out this place just like a whole construction thing going on. It's a gas station where you can't pump gas. OK, that's enough steering for the day. I gotta get a move on on this. There's a lot of simmering involved with this recipe. So OW transfer is literally no color on that. Or I just don't don't look at it. I feel like every time I watch cooking shows and they say this year is something. This is usually what it looks like. So if you have a little bit more time, see it properly. Please onion and garlic in and then we're gonna season that unit with salt. So the Salt's really important in terms of speeding this up, because that is what's going to draw the water out of it if that a little saute that smells great. Wow, alright, these bad boys need to soften lid this real quick. Talk about this dude on those he's getting out. He getting in. So whenever you're waiting for stuff like this, you can do other things like you can start cleaning or just getting things out of the way right like clear your work station. I gotta check the order at the rice little chick. I could have Ruby go. Hey look at all that water. Never gonna add our spices. Got more garam masala, more Kashmiri chili, more turmeric, fenugreek powder, little bit of shuggy, wuggy and last but not least, a little bit of garlic that I forgot earlier. Whoops, they just picked up what, Oh my God, I'm OK. 20 minutes it's only been 10 minutes. Just crossed 20 minutes it did. It's been 20 minutes. Well then we're just gonna blend this right now. OK, I'm gonna need a blender. I hope this gets cooked all the way through. Alright, onions going in and with the tomato sauce. That looks pretty good actually. Heat back on, you know what? I'm not even gonna reduce it. I'm just gonna go ahead and add my cream. I can do this chicken. Just gonna I'm just gonna throw it all in right that's our only option right now. Maybe I was getting a little too cocky. Little bit of salt. What Josh Poppy mustard that together nicely. This is how I would never ever make butter chicken. Good Lord, it doesn't look terrible though, so the butter chicken is simmering. We're in a good spot right now 'cause we just need to simmer this for five minutes. Lid is going on that's hot 10 minutes. He got 10 minutes to wrap it up to oh 10. Oh oh, we got this. I didn't have to do all that. I think this shows two things. You can always take this sort of artisanal approach and take your time with it and like really, crank it out. Make it every element perfect. But as you just saw I threw everything together really quickly in a huff and it's still kind of working. And that goes to show that they're hard enough rules. Sweeten up your space. It's always this is go get this go get that. It's never what do you wanna make faster? I really don't have any concept of time I think that it's been like 5 minutes and it's been like 4 hours God I'm gonna die so soon I'm just gonna wake up and be like wow it's been a couple of years and like Josh you're 70. This doesn't look bad for skipping pretty much every single step. Not bad, it tastes awesome. And it seasoned perfectly. Chickens cooked. This is done. It's been 14 minutes and look. It's somehow thick and I don't know how that's possible. I think that there's a cooking got out there and I think it's watching over me right now. It's already done Kendrick's probably telling some funny joke that Kendrick got love Kendrick heat off last bit. We got some cold butter 2 tablespoons and stir that in. There's a piece of cilantro on my spoon that went in there. Sorry about it. Let it emulsify in. Gonna get nice and rich and creamy. Beautiful, we're done. Oh my God. Oh *** **** there 5 minutes out they could eat my butter chicken. Rice in make it look nice. You know we have the time. We've skipped every single rule I've ever had. I might have learned myself something here to launch throw you for butter chicken 25 to 28 minutes. To make this butter chicken on the fly as quickly as humanly possible. It looks right. I usually prefer the seal bit more velvety smooth. But you know, I'm not opposed to this, but the sun is going away 'cause the sun is like alright shows over, but not yet. We still have to wait for them Showtime. Doors lock again. No, it's time for the blind voting round. Go kick drink. Number one. So we got our best four to five except for one person, Ulysses. Even if it was 5050 'cause the other one was still good, we still made it delicious buttered chicken. But more importantly, it reached the heights you would desire in a butter chicken, simply faster."

Full Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/the-2-dollar-chicken-tender-meal-but-cheaper","Children, you get your trusty chicken tender meal for 7 bucks. Chickens dry when you get have a gourmet for this price right here, that's much cheaper. Chicken tender meals have seemed to become a staple. I respect that honestly, I do kind of boring. You get your fried chicken fries, which oftentimes are soggy and almost always disappointing. Coleslaw, that isn't just bad, but it's like. Luke warm you don't happens to lukewarm mail rudney you expected to clean the cabbage, but instead when you put it in your mouth it just kind of drains into the back of your throat already. This is a very cheap meal. Not only are we gonna slash the price but we're gonna make it the ideal meal that it should have been at the same time while keeping your wallet so little. Being said, let's make this shall we look the best way to save money is to use what you already have. So although I always recommend making your own spice mix, unfortunately the number of spaces that would use here would make this well, two to three bucks over what I want this to cost for you. So we went out and found a chicken seasoning. We thought it tasted decent, about $2.78, and we're only going to use some of it to make sure it has salt. And if it doesn't, well, salt it please. Fried chicken without generous salt is like earth with no oxygen. First, let's talk chicken. Give yourself 4 boneless and skinless chicken breasts. Lightly pound them to flatten them and widen them slightly. Cut them into six strips each. That leaves you with 24 strips total, which gives up to about 8 servings depending on how much you eat, and these are hefty boys after frying separately mixed together, 2 cups are 475 milliliters of buttermilk and add 2 tablespoons are 22 grams of whichever chicken spicy. Fun hand if it has salt, perfect if it does not have salt then add about one tablespoon of 14 grams of kosher salt along with that mix together. Add your chicken strips and let them marinate for at least 20 minutes in the fridge but ideally overnight. Then go ahead and make your dredge by combining 3 cups or 450 grams of all purpose flour. 3 1/2 tablespoons are 40 grams of your chicken spice. Again, if it doesn't have salt then add about 1 1/2 tablespoons or 23 grams of kosher salt. In this twist together and there you go. Start hitting up 7 quart pot filled with about 3 quarts of vegetable oil 350 Fahrenheit. Now while that's going, instead of doing a little twirl. Around the kitchen, we're going to make our slaw in a medium size bowl. Slang in 1/4 cup or 52 grams of. 2 green onions, thinly sliced the zest of 1 lemon salt and pepper to taste. The juice of that same lemon. Wow, zero waste. Very nice in for close of garlic grated. Mix them together in your landing zone is prepared for your caba so you can have a head of green cabbage and using a very sharp knife or mandoline slices bad boy, real thin. You know the closer to paper the better. Man is gonna be a lot faster and easier for most of you, but be careful because it's the number one finger death trap I can think of. Find the whole anyway. Add your cabbage to the bull, toast together in season with additional salt if needed, and look at that, oftentimes with a great slot. Less is more, and I can tell you now this slot proves that logic unto sauce in a medium size bowl. Add half a cup or 105 grams of Mayo, 1/3 cup or 90 grams of ketchup, fresh cracked black pepper and salt to taste. 3 tablespoons are 43 grams of hot sauce. This is chilula. 2 teaspoons are 10 grams of Worcestershire sauce. Getting good at that. Two cloves of garlic grated. Mix that together and you have a chicken sauce. Do not at me with your canes bolt. I know how to make a proper chicken sauce worthy of any chicken strip. Also we have a canes, but better so before we fry our let's prep our fries. These are curly fries that are sort of like Arby's in the sense that they're lightly battered. Some states are no no, but I don't really care because it's delicious now. You'll need five medium russet potatoes. No need to peel them. I do want to point out that you do not need to make these curly for this to work. You can make it into matchsticks. Please relax, but if you have a spiralizer, that is how you make them curly by using the curly fry attachment that comes with it, assuming you have one so pop that bad boy on later. Rip get all your got damn. Billy Boys then place all your process potatoes in a bowl, cover with warm water. Season the water generously with salt and let us sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain your potatoes, dry them as much as possible with towels or paper towels. Toss the fries lightly with just a tiny pinch of all purpose flour, and then in a separate large bowl, add in One Cup of your dredge that you made earlier, plus one tablespoon or 7 grams of paprika. First cracked black pepper was together. Then whisk in 1 1/2 cups or 350 milliliters of water, and now we're ready to get cooking. First, your chicken in batches. Pull your chicken from the marinade. Toss in your remaining 2 cups of dredge. Shake off the excess. Get back into the marinade and dredge one last time, really packing on the flower so it adheres OK. If you're double dredging and you have UN dredged parts of your chicken, let me tell you I will Ding Dong your door and tell you that you're not getting a kiss. Shake up the excess and repeat with all of your chicken pieces. Now, once they're breaded in two to three batches, fry your chicken for three to four minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165 Fahrenheit and you have a beautifully flaky golden brown piece of chicken. Remove and place on a wire rack to cool, then immediately season very lightly with salt while still hot. And that's your chicken repeat with all your chicken, and once that's done, you're gonna want to immediately jump onto your fries in three to four batches. Dunk your lightly starch coated fries into your batter. Once everything is nicely coated, shake off the excess and lay into your oil. Gently be careful fry for three to four minutes, or until beautifully crispy and light golden brown. Remove draining a wire rack and again lightly seasoned with salt. Wall hot and repeat with the rest of your fries. Now I know these cheat the fries system. I'm not mad. Matter of fact, I'm going to enjoy every culinary sinful crunch now. To assemble, get yourself a large plate or a quarter sheet tray lined with parchment. Senior Slana little ramekin. Some of your chicken sauce and a separate one add on a generous layer of your crispy hot fries. Three pieces of your chicken nicely aligned and that is a beautiful chicken tender meal. Organized clean cut absolutely filled with the brim with flavor and above all for this price per person right here. Now let's taste test this and see if your tenders are a number one contender. Wow, here we are before we even start listen we've been seeing some people. Josh, there's no way that that costs that much. It costs me $25.00 to go get all this stuff. If you had to buy everything. Yes, but The thing is, you buy a £5 bag of flour. Did you use that entire thing of flour? No, you can still use it again. You're only using a small portion. You can make this recipe probably multiple times. The point is to maximize flavor with technique, using as little inexpensive ingredients as possible, and that's what we do right? First thing first slaw. Oftentimes, the simplicity of this actually makes this better. Look at this, can we get a sound test? Good God, the flavor of this is Immaculate. I honestly didn't expect it to turn out so good. I oftentimes want to add a ton of ingredients and stuff and it's just not necessary. Oh, I didn't try these. Whoever said you shouldn't battle your fries should shut up. Is he coated with the sauce? You can have the instant gratification of going to your favorite chicken shop, the freshness of getting this chicken and having the ultimate control for this price right here per serving. Still it doesn't get any better than that. It just doesn't. And you could say you made it. You have a bad day. Go achieve something you wanna know what else tickles my tendies B roll? OK, so we made our chicken tendy meal. Are you tired of having fried chicken? I just want to know honestly at this point forget everything else. I was gonna say I don't even care. We already know it's good. Chicken breast is single handedly. One of the most difficult foods to cook. Stop and we had French fries. Just leave this thing 'cause this is this is this is going to be what it is. I am completely out of it. I did not have my coffee. I don't even know what year it is. I didn't have my coffee until 10:30. If you enjoyed this video or you learn something people like, subscribe for a coffee."

King of the Crabs","But it has brought in these beautiful humongous king crab, king crab, Alaskan king crab king. Now these crabs are plucked out of that pristine waters across Alaska. And flown here and tonight, all of you, I'm going to turn this Alaskan king crab into something truly magical and break them down yourselves. Oh Lord, if I mess this up in front of seven Morimoto, that's embarrassing. No good news is chef Morimoto and I am going to show you how. Unreal thank you wow, my crying being blessed to be in the presence of somebody you look up to like that it's overwhelming. It's unbelievable, it's unreal, right? First things first, Alaskan king crab. It is the Rolls Royce, the sea. But most important thing is to make sure we get a maximum yield on all the crab coming out. How old do you think this is? 15 years old guys. OK, pull off the legs first one. Two and you pull and twist as well. Three and one big claw. Good. And twist, uniform twist and pull it. Be careful so you do not target too hard. Just twist and pull and then for me just slide that off. Let's fill them in there. We do not want to see that right. I think you can use anything. Don't say that citizens as well both sides take this. Is it easier? Except like this, we're looking at around $500 wow cost wow. So think of the yield OK? Absolute gotcha. This is easier than take open it nice, then easy. Anyone die for crabs? I mean, I catch him every day, but not like this and we use them for bait which he would do for this. I'm making sure that I could do everything exactly like he does it and exactly like he does it. I'm stoked to be watching him at the same time. I gotta focus on what they're doing. Never smash the shell. What happens when you smash the shell? Shell? Bits of shell throughout the crab? Open up, thumbing beneath again and lift. Look at that, OK? Now let's be honest, it's the kind of crab that's almost like caviar is finishing dishes. You don't put this in a crab cake, understood never, so understand what you're dealing with here. When you slice the claw on twist and snap pops off. Thing comes in underneath. Come in. They come down now. The exciting part. Putting the most amazing jigsaw together. It's like Pablo Picasso painting there's so much mess yet there's so much beauty and you start to see this picture being formed. And at the end you have this perfectly broke down beautiful king crab. That is how 2 master chefs breakdown and Alaskan crab. Oh my God. Amazing outstanding."

#TheFWord #GordonRamsay","Right, the most amazing fish and chips which is my go to comfort food served with incredible fries and the most delicious mushy peas. For me, fish and chips screens card highly sustainable, delicious. But the secret is in the batter. This is a beer batter. 00 flour eggs and beer. It sort of makes it lighter crispier and it's an amazing flavor. The secret is to make that batter the night before. The more you can let it rest, it becomes so crispy. Take your card, run it through into seasoned flour, salt, pepper. You could jazz this up a little bit with a touch of paprika. Lightly season your fish. 2 water fish can destroy the batter so I like to season my fish. First, with salt that extracts the moisture from the fish, which keeps the batter even more crispy. Then from there just brush off that seasoning and just pads down the fish. That way it stays nice and firm into the flower and then nicely rolled. Make sure we get the ends done. Dredge the fish in the flower in order to make sure the batter sticks really important, and then next into the batter. Make sure you dust off any excess flour, otherwise you get these white clumps of flour underneath the batter into the batter. Then it's sink. I like topping tailing my fish like. Trim the top, trim the base. We've got the even piece of fish. If it's cut evenly, it's gonna cook evenly. Shake off the excess flour and into the batter. Roll that fish round and let it sink in there. Now oil comes up to 300. It takes about 6 to 7 minutes to cook beautifully. But here's the secret. Keep that fish coated. This is where it gets messy, but exciting. Lift up your fish, go left to right, dredging it and then very quickly get a point on the fish. Let the batter rundown shake off any excess flour. And then into the fryer and justice sort of taunt it first, and justice let it lay away from you. Shake the pan gently. That starts to cover the top of the fish. Take a spatula and just gently based the top of the fish. Once you've had the fish in there for two minutes, flip over the fish and that way you see it evenly coated because it's beautiful golden brown. Now take that out, shake it well, let that sit there like these perfect parcels, and literally, that's it there. Now, as it's piping hot. Get your salt and just lightly season the top and what happens to the fish now it just gets even crispier, but the batter seasoned underneath and on top. That's really important, right? Fries? These are Yukon gold potatoes and basically just peeled, not wash 'cause I want the start to get really nice and crispy. I start them off at a very low temperature in a way that I glanced them and that is literally in the oil first for two minutes at 3:30 in. Planting basically means cooking with no color and the secret here now is the blanche for two minutes at 3:30. Take them out, let them rest, crank up the heat, go from 320 to 385. Great now temperatures risen fries back in second time cooking and this time it's getting really nice and crispy. A great indicator cooking in fryers is that when it starts to float a confirmation that it's cold, whether it's fish, chicken or fries. Cooking fries twice. Blanching them first and then put them back in hot oil at the end. There's so much more healthier because they don't. Set in the oil anywhere near as long as frozen fries so it's really good to cook them twice. Super healthy fries are gonna shake. I can hear how crisp they are out onto a tray, drain them really well, lightly rub off the excess fat, let them sit there. I love placing them into a bowl. Fresh parsley on top, a touch of paprika and then touch of salt and pepper and then from there just roll them around here how crispy they are. Beautiful fish and chips have not been complete unless we got peas. I use frozen peas all the time so don't be scared. A splash of oil, just a splash peas go in. She is such a salt, such a pepper, a little hint of shallots, minced in and garlic. Great way of elevating mushy peas from their little knob of butter in. And then you just toss those peas. Once that bus is evaporated, we turn off the gas and then just crush. It's beautiful and that's why you take this frozen pea into a mushy pea and we sort of trying to break it up almost like a sort of like a puree, but I don't want to refine them too much because the flavor is when you burst them, touch more butter in there. Butter gives it a really nice glossy finish. One more little finishing touch. Fresh mint. Just bring your legs down, lay them on top of one another, get your largest leaf on the bottom, roll it really tight and then just shred. Let the knife do the work. Look useful fresh mint. Eagle that over your peas and that just lifts the peas beautifully. When I serve lemon on a plate, I take these bits off. Is it like the posh parts? It's just like the perfect wedge or slice of lemon and now we're ready to plate fish comes over. Yeah, how crunchy that is Fry's makes you know crispy. There beautifully done and then from there this beautiful mound of mushy peas place to the side. Finally the sort of Rolls Royce of sources with fish and chips, tartar sauces and mayonnaise with gherkins, onions and the most amazing capers in there that goes on the side and that just cascades off. And how can you serve fish and chips without lemon? I get my lemon here and I just squeeze it. Over the fish onto the salt and then kind of fresh one there literally for seconds. And there we have fish and chips. Alan Gordon."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo,Gordon Ramsay - Crabs Benedict | Masterchef,,"Home cooks tonight. You will be replicating a version of a crab dish prepared by one of the greatest chefs that I know, Gordon Ramsay. Tonight you're gonna have to use the crab meat that you extracted earlier and turn it into a faultless replication of my amazing crab Benedict. You all have to recreate this exact masterpiece. Now I'm going to show you how it's done. Fans cast iron pan, lightly buttered and get them in there so nice and toasted. Right holidays. First off, water up to a rolling boil. Pole in a goes in. Now we start whisking on the heat 15 seconds off the heat. Next step on a little teaspoon of your tarragon reduction in and keep whisking really important. Now slowly add your butter 123 stop. You can see the sauce starting to thicken up. Now we start to season salt. From there, a little touch of fresh lemon juice. Just squeeze that lemon in there and then pour that delicious rich holidays into your ramekin. Now poaching an egg. First of all, a touch of salt into the water and then a teaspoon of vinegar from their crack the egg and open it up into a cup. What we want to do now is create a bit of a vortex. Spin the water around, and then we drop the egg in there so it swells round gently. They should take on average 90 seconds to two minutes. Post that egg beautifully. Now, the crab salt and pepper. Drizzle of olive oil just a touch from their lemon zest so it's going to make it really nice and vibrant, and then squeeze your lemon juice in there. From there, your fresh chives. Roll that around. Don't overwork the crab. Now we're ready for legs, lift up and then gently place them on the towel bars is sitting there a light seasoning? Beautiful post eggs. Now our muffins beautifully toasted and then take your crab onto the bun. Now very carefully roll the egg into the spoon and sit it gently onto the crab. Now you take your holidays and you coat it almost like a nice brush of varnish. No drips. Again, take your time care for the pressure or the egg and then finally a light dusting of paprika. And that's how you make a delicious crab Benedict. But when we go in? That is what we're looking for."

The actress also explained how she wasn't allowed to use the word ""butt"" growing up, chatted about her new movie, ""The Adam Project,"" and shared the continued success of her Once Upon a Farm line.","You look beautiful. Thank you for being here. The last time I saw you we were zooming with each other, yes, and without these guys now we have people. So you were in a hotel and I was making you a scream from your balcony or outside of your window. Yes, yeah. I like the job. She's funny. I get a lot more Chamberlain. Did you get anybody's attention? I did were there. There were a couple of people out there who was like what, you know. We're also just like what they were alarmed, but you know what else you did? You made me do a tequila shot and that's that's the only tequila shot I've ever done in my life. And I did it live on Ellen. It was wait yet without my hands. Yep. That's your first tequila shot ever. For you. I cannot believe you've never done a tequila. I thought before that I didn't know what would happen. I think I just thought I would combust or something. It was fine. You are, you know, I have to talk about you growing up and because I I learned today when you grew up, you were not allowed to to say bodily words like we, you couldn't say, but we couldn't say no. We couldn't say that because you know, I read that you couldn't swear, but I heard you said biscuit instead of. But yeah, the Garner girls 'cause we all have a biscuit on us. So we all said biscuit. But is a swear word, but is a swear word at my house really? Uh, huh? What did you call these things? *****. You can say ***** but you can't say Boo. We couldn't say bodily function words like. Crap anyway, right? You can say I'm on TV. You're welcome guys. Yeah, you're welcome. That's what happens when you repress your children. They come out on television and say crap. Oh, there we are. The Garner girls? Yeah, we weren't allowed to have really layers in. My gosh, look at the ears guys. OK and my mom this was a quilting phase and those were leftover scraps from the quilt she made for my bedroom and she made me a matching vest so I matched my bed. You matched your bed, I did and then who's the the Susanna is the little one the one that had a big one? Is that a hat? No, it's not a hat. That's your hair. There's a lot of hair. And I I was growing out that same haircut. It was $8.00 and Sandy Copeland cut our hair for a lot of years. Sandy Copeland. Yep, she was that your friend. No, she's just to cut her hair. Well, that's quite something. Look what look, what you turned out to be? That say, you're a fashion Easter now. Backstage, it's it's every every day. I see those people. It's a major glow up. No, no, no you, you look fantastic all the time and I follow you on Instagram and you do all kinds of cool things. You also set your kitchen on fire recently I didn't actually set it on fire. I just I might have put my kitchen in peril. There was what are you making right? There just are you just like making fire? What were you making? Oh my gosh it does look quite like something now that you show it. I was making it was Christmas Eve and I was making a beef burger and it is sorry beef Bergen young. And and it was Ina Garten's recipe from barefoot in Paris she has two beef Bergen Young, but I would recommend barefoot in Paris. And well, I doubled it and I had doubled it before, but I'd never doubled the alcohol all at once. What kind of alcohol is it? It's cognac uh-huh, it's flammable, yeah? And how did you what happened? I mean you so like you can't even get near that to put it out well, I was prepared to do something. What did you do? I stood and made a face. That was number one, but I was I. I grabbed the lid. I was ready to put the lid on top and if that didn't work why I was gonna use baking powder so that I I'm shaking soda or powder? What is it 'cause I need to know? I would have used both. Does that put the fire out? I'm not sure, but that was my next move and then I'm sure there was a fire extinguisher somewhere in the house. I mean, come on, I would have found one. Well, they're supposed to be in the kitchen, that's I'm sure there was. That's where you keep a fire extinguisher. Certainly I do. And then, well, then you should know where it is or four. I will let you know, yeah. But and by the way, may I say it when I'm saying how good you look. I know that you're turning 50 and you're embracing it. You like it, which I like. Yeah yeah I am. Yeah, yeah, I mean. Right, why not? I'm I. It's suddenly I don't know why I feel surprised that I'm suddenly turning 50, but I do have this sense of like what the heck. It's really here and I don't know. I like the idea that wait a minute all of a sudden I'm feeling like I'm allowing myself to believe that I know what I know. It's empowering, yes. I mean, I think we all when we get to a certain milestone, we get to a certain age. We're like, how did that happen? 'cause when we were kids, we all looked at that like Oh my God that's old. And then when you're that age you're like oh it's actually not and I'm here already. Yes Andy just tell me. OK, baking powder is highly flammable, so anybody out there that's listening to this woman? Do not put baking powder. I wonder if baking soda is the same. It is not like baking soda. Baking soda site. Baking powder is highly flammable. Come to dinner. Guys please. I love to have you. OK alright, what was Jennifer after this so that. You guys when I tell you that this movie The Adam Project is a must see for everyone. It's coming out on Netflix win March 11th so it is it is.

#LilyCollins #EmilyinParis #Ellen #TheEllenShow #EllenDeGeneres","So what a year you've had. So congratulations on the Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for Emily in Paris. And you got married. You found a decent guy. I did. I got married. Decent guy. Thank you yeah. It was quite. It was quite a year, yeah, and so you got married. I just saw you next to a waterfall. Where was this? Oh yeah it was a place called Dunton. Hot Springs in Colorado millimeter. We had never actually been there until about the day before we got married, which was really fun. Planning a wedding before visiting the location but but it was stunning and we love nature. So yeah, I know y'all really love nature. You're both is how did you meet? We met. We both are in the industry and we have. Parents that are in the similar industry as well, but we we met randomly actually so we were kind of surprised we hadn't met yet. We've been in the same rooms a bunch of times and never met, but it was kind of one of those cheesy but true love at first sight. And did you both know right away that you were both outdoorsy? No, he did not know that I was very outdoorsy. I don't think I knew I was quite as outdoorsy as I became, but I grew up in the English countryside, so I've always loved being outdoors, but we didn't waste it. Did he like being outdoors as much as? Because the two of you together are always someplace interesting, it's we are we? We really like embracing new adventures. So so where is this? Oh, this is on our honeymoon in Norway. We went all around Scandinavia on like a foodie adventure tour. Now I've never been to Norway, but that seems beautiful and cold. Was it cold, freezing? And if anyone knows me, they know that I'm just like not a fan of the cold, but I embraced it I we got, we got in the water which is freezing. Beyond freezing, I saw you jump in the water, yes, and then so this tree house we have a picture of the tree house that you stayed in and so that's I mean that's where you and and what what happens in that tree house like what? A lot happens in that trail. I want to know every every everything nobody. Well, that's a tree going through the tree. Yeah, it's it's wild. So this is in the Swedish Lapland and every tree house is done by a famous architect. And we stayed in the one that you just saw. And it has a literal tree that goes in the middle of it. And there's this netting that you can lay on your back and stare at the stars. It's so beautiful. It's so romantic. It's also odd because there's obviously like no piping that goes up to the tree house, so. Like it's very close quarters and you know when you go to the bathroom, it's you have to do anything. You're going to do into a paper bag, which then gets incinerated, which then turns to dust, which gets buried and made into a tree. No, no, it's like you know it's ecofriendly. No Internet, I'll tell you that much no no. I would never see that note of that at 4:00 in the morning. If you have to pee or whatever, you just have to remember the bag. Wow, yeah, that's. I mean, I love architecture and that looked really cool and that's why I was asking 'cause it didn't look like there was electricity or plumbing or anything there. It just looked pretty. It's pretty yeah. And then you swam with a well. Well, first, let's talk about the moose thing. So I want to get to the swimming with the whale. 'cause that was incredible, but you learned you were calling a moose, not on a phone. You were calling a moose. And just to see it, not to shoot. It wasn't no, no, no, this is just purely for the joy of finding a mood, right? So here's a guy. We have a clip of a guy teaching you how to call. It sounds like a moose in distress. Get lovely. McHale was our was our moose guide afficianado. He's been doing it for like 40 years. We didn't know what noise was gonna come out of his mouth and he prefaced it by saying this may be funny to some of you and I was like no, it's not. It's going to be so not funny and then it started in the entire time I had to just stand with my back and all you saw was my shoulders doing this but I couldn't keep it straight. But did you learn how to do it? I heard it for 2 1/2 hours so I feel like maybe we didn't see a moose, though it didn't work. Yeah, it sounds like a moose would have a deeper you know instead. Anyway, we get we're gonna take a break and then I want to look at the whale that you swam with, which is incredible. I can't imagine doing that. We'll be back more with Lily. That's really college and Emily in Paris. It's a huge hit on Netflix, so this is a clip from Season 2. What happens in season two? More adventures with Emily and the love triangle that we left off in more fun. And you know, Emily isms in the workplace? So much more adventure there. Lots more in the French culture and a new classmate in French class who intrigues and annoys her. And we'll see where that leads. And there's a scene in a steam room. Where you're with naked people are they, they're naked, right? Yes, they were. Yeah, I essentially spent the day at the SPA, but they were naked or topless and it's just it's just not. It's not normal to spend a day at work like that. Obviously it was very totally done respectfully, but as I didn't know where to look. It's like wait 'cause I'm like meeting actors for the day and you're like hi, yeah you did great in that scene and it's like there's that weird to say. It's just bizarre, right? But I mean it felt nice to be in a steam room all day. Yes? Well, that's good for you anyway. Hydrates my skin alright, so let's take a look at this so you're in Tahiti again, traveling being outdoorsy. And yeah you, there's a whale and and a baby, a humpback whale and her baby and you just jumped in and look how close she is watch how close she gets. Whoop there, that's me. Yeah. That is incredible, it was. So that might look terrifying. I don't know. Maybe there I looked very happy. That was very happy right there. It was the most calming spiritual experience. It was very unexpected. It wasn't even the season to really see them that closely, let alone at all. And I was watching my husband surf and all of a sudden the the captain of the ship said there's a whale. Do you want to jump in and swim with it? It's like I never thought I'd hear those words and I just went yes and I didn't even think of it because I'm deathly afraid of sharks. I watched Jaws at far too young of an age and but I just jumped right in and all of a sudden a a baby showed up and we realized it was the mother and her baby. And I mean it was as close as you are and it just they both just stared at me for like 30 seconds and I just felt I felt so calm. It was magic I I would love to do that yeah, but I've heard they're just highly intelligent beings and. God lucky you. That's amazing. It was. It was special maybe. Maybe Emily and Tahiti? I don't know. Yeah season 2 of Emily in Paris is streaming now on Netflix will be right back."

#PenelopeCruz #SalmaHayek #Ellen #TheEllenShow #EllenDeGeneres","It's so good to see you great to see you again. It's been awhile and happy holidays to you and did you spend it? I know you live in. Here's part time in Spain part time. Were you in Spain for the holidays? No, we were here in LA. Yeah, because my brother lives here and we are very close. I'm 11 years young, he older than him and he has a little baby. I had met him but my kids still had not met. Their cousin and they were very angry and upset about that. And finally we could be here together with them. Oh, that's sweet, that's great. Are there specific traditions that you have coming from Spain and do you do them here? Well, you know that we eat 12 grapes for New Year's evening in the last 12 seconds. In 12 seconds. You have to eat 12 grapes. Yeah, and normally they give you grapes that are this big. So I'm always like looking at everyone and nobody is choking. And this is the first time that I go to a place and my own brother didn't have the grapes prepared. So for Javier and I was like the end of the world, how are we going to do this ritual without agreeing? And what is that supposed to mean? Is that it's that? What's that do when you eat the 12 grace? I think you know we've done it for so long that is. And some people say you ask for one wish for each grape, and for others is more superstition thing. For me. It's just this beautiful ritual with my family. Since I was a little girl. But I have to say, since I have little children, it has become such a stressful moment. I'm looking at them like I are you still breathing right right? Yeah, just shove 12 grapes in your mouth. I I used to cut them like give them a quarter of the group. They don't want that. They want the whole thing so well. The most important thing is that you were with your family and your loved ones and we're all grateful and we're healthy, healthy and happy. And stuff like that. You have been here many times, your first time here was season one season 2. And so this is what you were teaching me. Do you remember this moment where you were teaching me a dance that you did in a movie? Ah Oh my God, yes, I remember. And you did it too great. It's it's. It's a lot of commitment, yeah? Hey Selma Hayek was here your your good friend Selma and she? Well, first we were zooming with her and the owl. Actually, I wanted to meet it and the owl showed up with lunch and its claws. And then we were talking about it here. Have you met the owl? Yes, of course. Do you like the owl? Love the owl? Because when she told me that she had one I was blown away because when I was little my grandmother had a neighbor who had an owl and I was really scared of the owl but I always wanted to go and see her. And then Salma has one at home and and she invites us to feed the owl with these little rats and give it to my daughter to give the rat to the album. Yeah little traumatic for her. Yeah yeah that's not the way to. How old is your daughter eight? No no but but she was. The older animal has to eat too but the first day was you know she was very impressed by that. I love owls though and I think that's so cool. I keep telling her she needs to get a second one because it needs a pal. I agree yeah but he's so cute then yeah she has. And and also, did you know that her house was haunted? She didn't tell me that we've been in that house and I believe it. If she says that it's haunted, I believe her. You wouldn't be scared of that. You would like that, right? If if she sees these interviews, he's gonna laugh because they, you know when I go to LA the first time, we didn't know each other. Only on the phone. And I got here with a ticket to make a movie. I had my return ticket so I was coming here for two months and I didn't know anyone here and she picked me up at the airport and she said you're not going to the hotel. You're coming to my house because this is hard at the beginning and you're gonna feel very lonely. So she took me to her house. That's why now we're like sisters. And and I ended up also sleeping in her room because I was scared. And you know, that's the way we we met. And on top of that, in the middle of the night, she says that I was holding her hand because because I was afraid. I don't know I was dreaming. I don't so she would love so much if she hears you say that because our beginning was really particular. That's really sweet though, and that's great that she took you in and that she knew that it was to be hard. He was amazing. You know that somebody that I I really didn't know only on the phone? Yeah, he made sure that she picked me up at the airport and she didn't let me go to the hotel she she told me you are whether you want it or not you you don't know me but you're coming to my house. I'm not going to leave you alone I leave. So much, but you know, from day one she's been like that with me. Yeah, now she's well, she's fantastic. I love her. I adore. Should we take a break and we'll talk about the movie after this? All right, we'll take a break more with Penelope. After this, we're back with penélope Cruz and so parallel mothers tell everybody about what what the film is about beautiful. By the way, thank you, I love these films and I there is not a lot that I can share about what happens in this story, but. Two women we meet at a hospital on the same day that we're going to give birth, and something happens in that day that is going to make our destinies like be stuck together. Forever, but he's really, really interesting. The way he's written. Pedro is a total genius. Yeah, then I I love making these films so much. It's really special. It's fantastic and you seem to enjoy playing pregnant. Is that something you look for in a film where I have a very strong maternal instinct and Pedro and I know each other since I was 17 and he always saw that in me. So every one of the movies that I've done with him, I will see their pregnant or I was a mother or I was giving birth in a bus like my first movie with him. I was 10 minutes of the movie giving birth. In a bus uh-huh. Yeah, so you enjoy doing that. I love it, you know. I mean, being a mom is the best thing in the world, but but he he always. He always saw that in me. Yeah it goes everywhere we go. Any kid that I see I I go and I start talking to them and he was always like stop doing that. They don't know you kid alone but I can't. I don't think the kid minds when you do that all right and let's talk about your other movie that's out right now 'cause Jessica was here, Chastain and recently the 355 great cast and completely different kind of film. So you go from that. Film to this this wild action film that you didn't have to do too much action in. Yeah, because when when Jessica and Simon, the director called me to be a part of this, they didn't even have a script. It was an idea and they they asked me what do you imagine doing in a world of space? What kind of character would you like to play? And I told them actually I would love to play the fish out of water. I don't see that so much is in this in this genra in this movie, which by the way is five female leads, the ones that are saving the world. Everyone is really smart. Everyone is really good at. Many things, but not good at everything and my character is a psychologist and she doesn't want to be an agent in the field and she's a mother and she works in her city with her family. But something happens and she's forced to be in that mission and she's forced to be traveling with them and risking her life. And it's interesting also to see one of the group being the mother and showing the conflict of that kind of lifestyle and danger combined to like calling the husband and saying, make sure this doesn't get any dairy like things like that, right? Right that we kind of improvised. Well, it's a great cast. I mean it's you and Jessica and Lupita and Diane. Anyway, it's great."

#KhloeKardashian #Ellen #TheEllenShow #EllenDeGeneres","True pooped in the bathtub. I've really never experienced that before. What is a warning you're going to give to someone about to have kids? Well, I mean, the warning is that no one really knows what they're doing. We all just pretend that we do, and I don't care how many kids you have. I think it's exhausting for everyone. What's your biggest parenting fail? All right? My daughter, 3 so right now. Maybe it's too young to tell, but call me when she's 13. I'm sure I'll have quite a few. What's the biggest difference between you and your sisters parenting styles? I am really strict. I have a schedule, I'm very militant with how I parent true and I believe that a schedule saves everything and not all of my siblings are the same. I will not tell you which ones, what's something you've had to learn on the fly as a parent that I'm true pooped in the bathtub. I really never experienced that before I did it. No people just. I pooped in the tub. It was disgusting and I don't want to relive it. But yeah, I had to learn that on the fly. What's a lie? You recently told your kid. If she made this funny face again, it's going to stay like that parenting trick you learn from your own mom. If you don't want something, just say you're allergic and then how can they prove you wrong? What is a trait of you? Where is your child? Has that you wish they didn't? I am incredibly clean and organized. I like everything in its place. I'm very regimented and I don't want that for true, but she already has so much of that I feel bad that she has so much of it so young, but every toy has to be put back exactly where she got it from, not from me. That's what she does, and I always just try to. Mess things up and tell her it's OK to live in a mess. Although I'm cringing inside, I don't want her to cringe, so she has that, and I wish you didn't. What's something you swore you'd never do as a parent that you do now when we go out to restaurants? I do give true my iPhone to watch YouTube so I don't have to hear a freak out. What's your favorite thing about being a mom? I think all of it. I'm so in love and obsessed with my daughter and just seeing life through her eyes. I wouldn't change a thing."

twitter.com/stevetvshow","So I'm single. I've never been married. I have no children, but I've gotten to the point where I'm comfortable being single like I take trips by myself, I go to the movies by myself. I like enjoy spending time with me, but on the flip side of that, it's like I don't put forth the energy or the effort into dating, especially like online dating. And when I do date, maybe one date, it's never really a second date either. I lose interest, or I don't hear anything. You know, I don't. I don't hear back, so I've also been told that I'm an alpha female, so I had this older man tell me that my presence says. I'm not playing any games and I I don't. A man doesn't feel needed so I just wanna know what do I need to do to soften my exterior to become more approachable? Well I mean look. I mean, let's just go over what you said. You don't have a man, you're single. You don't have any children. You've gotten comfortable with being single, so you like that. So you don't you portray I'm good. Once you portray I'm good to a man, he cannot be the knight in shining armor 'cause you good. I mean, there's nothing wrong with it. That's the way you want to go about it. But I'm just telling you how men are men like to feel like they can be the hero. Now if you take away the hero role from us, then what you want us to be? 'cause I want to be somebody hero. I don't want to save you in all like this, but I want to be there, you know, make your life better and then hopefully you make mine better. So I think what you need to do is you need to change your frequency. OK, you know a lot of people don't understand how important it is. You know what you exude is what you draw back. It's like if you go home and you grab your remote. Without thinking, if you pressed red button, you expect your TV to come on because that's the frequency you have to change your frequency. Your frequency is all off. You putting out something and expecting something different back? How does that work? If you want more people to shake your hand, you have to extend your hand to more people. If you want. More people to love you. You gotta love more people. It's just your frequency.

We're still working on that trying to find her a man and and now that I'm about to have my first daughter, my first child, I really want to make sure that she has best of both worlds. I want her to have a great male influence in her life, but I am a single parent, so. My question to you is how am I supposed to make sure she has best of both worlds and has a positive male influence in her life? Or what can I do to tell her teacher? So let me ask you a question. You like for your baby to have a positive male role model in her life? Yes, I do. Could it possibly be? I'm just I don't know. I don't feel like it could be no I don't I don't feel like no the father is not going to be positive the way I would know I don't feel like it that's why I'm sure no I mean just let me say this though. He may not be a great man to you. He may not be a good mate. Amen. But that don't mean he can't be a great father. Faint. So. You know? I would say this to you, I would say. I would say start. I know he probably did something wrong, he did something stupid. I he might have, I don't know. I'm on my third marriage. Two people think I'm the most trifling person on Earth. Well, guess what? I am really, really really a good father. I really AM. I'm really, really a good father. I even I even take pride in being a father. It is my honor and privilege to be a father. It it really is, you know, to guide my children, to offer rooms, love and support and guidance. That's the most. You ain't gotta have money to be a good father. Love someone got it so I know this probably not your question but don't freeze him out the baby's life because y'all not cool he he may not be cool with you. But your daughter gonna need her daddy. Or or Daddy, because what happens is fathers are very equally important and daughters lives as we are in boys lives. It's about teaching the boy the principles of manhood and how to be disciplining. Throw a football and be tough and all that. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. But you also gotta be around to show your daughter what a man love looks like. You know what I mean. So take care of that now. To maybe answer your question, you're right, you do have to get a male figure in her life, so I tell you what? Here's all you have to do. Let's just put it on you. Does your baby let's just put it on you the next man you date? Before you do anything with him, let's determine the quality of person, he agree, agree agree. That's what started. Then go about your life look. People have kids out of wedlock all the time. That don't. That says nothing about you. That's not, don't don't make you a bad person that don't make you something wrong with you, no, you, I mean, you mean you good people. Make mistakes all the time. The problem is God don't make no mistakes. Pretty good deal. You're gonna be fine. Where's Allison, Allison? Hey you made it to the end of this video.

About Jimmy Kimmel Live:

Jimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy®-nominated “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” ABC’s late-night talk show. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is well known for its huge viral video successes, with over 11 billion views and more than 15 million subscribers on the show’s YouTube channel. Some of Kimmel’s most popular comedy bits include “Celebrities Read Mean Tweets,” “Lie Witness News,” “Unnecessary Censorship,” “Halloween Candy YouTube Challenge,” and music videos like “I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum.”","Our next guest is a multi platinum selling and Grammy nominated singer songwriter. His new single light switch has over 100,000,000 streams such as a lot of them and his album Charlie comes out later this year. Please welcome Charlie Puth. You are boy 100,000,000 is a lot of streams right? Yeah, we we just hit that last night on Spotify. I know, you know what happened. Honestly. I heard you were real close and I just got on and just started listening and listening and listening. Got you over the hump myself? Yeah, thank you. Thank you, I appreciate that. No problem anytime you need it. I love it. You did an interesting thing with this song. I think is that you kind of like brought everyone in on the creative process. Yeah, I had always wanted to make a song with a sound effect and I thought what was that sound effect going to be? And I slammed the door and I'm like no and I hit a light switch and I'm like oh, if I could turn my brain off with a light switch it would sound like this and I kind of had that concept rolling in my head and I thought this is such a strange idea. I have to put it on Tik T.O.K. Engage the audience reaction on it and that video now has 150 million views on the talk. The making of the song has more views than the actual song has listened well right now. That's been out for like six months. Yeah, right. Sure, yeah. I mean, I don't mean to get them in a fight or anything like that. No, that's alright. I feel like a brand new artist. I'm 30 years old and I'm going viral on Tik T.O.K with Gen Z and everything. Oh, that's funny. Everything 'cause I think of you, young guy, it's like yeah he's tick tock. But yeah you are. A little older than the usual tick. Tock. Well there was a 10 year old fan that came up for me the other day and said it's Charlie from. Tick tock you're from. Tick tock. I'm like no. I'm actually like three times Grammy nominated and. I have like a Golden Globe. You gotta start carrying that globe around with you, yeah and then and then I'm just alone and showing him showing him like that. This is the video that you the part of the making of video that you show how the song came together. What if there was a song that started off like? There's something missing. There should be like a weird sound effect, just a random noise or something like that. Let me turn this light on. Oh my God, this is actually kind of dope. I'm freaking out right now. Why you turn me on? With. Why did you say why your phrase was read? Well, I I had just gotten the facial that day because I truly didn't think anybody was gonna watch that video like this will get like 1000 views of most, but it went it now. It's and it's one of my biggest songs I've ever put out. Are you going to do that for the other songs on the album? Will you involve the audience before you record them? Yeah, I want everybody. I'm the king of oversharing when it comes to this album, so I want everybody to feel like they wrote every song with me. Will those people get paid as writers? He just wanted to feel like your next question. That's a publishing nightmare or they say you have perfect pitch. Yeah, what does that mean exactly? Like this desk is brown. Yes wow piece of paper is well. I'm getting to the point. Your jacket is perfect vision two, this is incredible. Well, my point is like your jacket is black. If I hear like it can you play a CAC sharp as. Wow and in F# is. And then a G is G. So it's weird. It's like I can hear the note before it even. How old were you when you realized that was the case? I was 12 years old, 12 years old and I thought, you know, in the House and well, I grew up playing in church and then one day the church organist didn't show up and I just played the whole mess from memory. But I really didn't think and it's like not like in musician world. It's not the best thing for somebody to like, brag about perfect pitch. So I brought it up just for the record, you didn't. Well, I've been scolded all my life for bringing it up into schools as very like. Careful perfect is is like weird in there. It's 'cause it's about recognizing that pitch and be able to match it right? Well, one of the I made that I'll do the same thing. I told you that that stay song with kid Leroy and Justin Bieber. Thank you. Can you like sit? And when we were making nut song, it was I did a little bit high at first. So instead of Bah Bah, Bah, Bah, I did bom, bom, bom bom, and he has a Roy has a high voice. But if I just switched it to 1 semitone down and I got to hear it in my head before I got to play it. So it's kind of a useful tool when making a song on the fly. Can I tell you something? I have no idea what you're talking about, but it sounds very impressive. Super impressive. OK, so will you use anymore sound effects in your next songs? Because maybe if maybe if this sounds good to you, maybe you can tell me even what note this is. If I were to just take a pen and put it on the side, you could somehow work it into one of your songs. Sure, OK wow, this will be OK. Here we go. That sounded OK, so that was actually 2 notes. If you play a C&AC sharp together clay, yeah so. And it goes up the AC. That's crazy, so that's a minor second. So that's why fire alarms in hotels like are. It's a minor second because it kind of prompts you to get up and go out of the building. And I'm standing up. But it's OK to stand, but if a fire alarm were like instead of C&C sharp if it were C. It would be too pleasant and no one would leave the building. So that's why car horns let me try this one. 'cause maybe it'll be more pleasant. Hey so hey. So Amy, I'm never. Come on, that's crazy one color my song one color. I'm only one call away used to be in that key and then we changed it to a little bit higher. It's a it's a D flat major oh so should I put more liquid in the glass? But if you play those together, I guess you can't because you have. Oh, that's an F# Now so play F#. So. Did you guys work on this beforehand? You could be making all of this up. We'd have no idea. You can hear him play your Jeffrey Incahoots over here. No wow. Do you have like a keen sense of smell? Like a drug sniffing dog too? No, but I used to mess with my teachers in in school because usually when you put your phone on vibrate, it's an A flat, like a lower a flat. And yeah and I always used to go. Oh, what's a really? Stupid and useless, but really good. Frank really good Frank wow. How cool am I alright? Well you've heard him make noises and now he's going to sing for us a single light switch is out now. We moved back. Thanks for watching and remember every time you click the subscribe button, one of your enemies gets destroyed."

How long you been a Giants fan? Early 70s they are the best in the West. You can't go wrong with being a Giants fan, it's just something about the Giants. Ever since I've been young, giants are really like a family, more so than just a team. So you really feel close to them and it's just great to be there and to support them. You would never turn your back on your family. Well, of course not. I bleed orange and black for the San Francisco Giants. It's great we're supposed to shoot the other side of this with LA fans. Any chance I could get you to do as a huge favor? Don't want a Dodgers thing and say the same thing, but it's just the other side. It'll be alright. It's OK. Yeah, just thanks. Oh, that's great. Suck so much. Just like just getting the last stops go ahead. I bleed blue for the ellee Dodgers, yeah? They suck me into that. Oh, you got busted by a real fan? Give me a talk to us Sir. I'm a Giants fan all the way. Your excellent camera we're supposed to shoot the other side of this in LA, but any chance we can get you just quickly throw in a Dodger hat say the same thing and just do the other side for us so we don't have to travel down there. Alright? So then I'm there. I'm an LA Dodgers fan from the womb to the tool. Search for the Giants and I'd be disowned. If I get good giants. Really hope you helping so it's OK. I got hold up for you. Just just say the same thing. I'll hold that for you my whole family. Sound. What is your family of Giants fans going to think of this? They're gonna think that I had too much wine. Can't wait to see the Giants destroyed. The Dodgers. I can't wait to see LA Smash and Encisco for the worst fans in the world. No loyalty whatsoever. No loyalty whatsoever. We don't like that at all. The only blue Weaver four is Beyonce's daughter. Giants. I just present friends, testicle go doctors. My Mama didn't raise. No Dodgers fan. Go giants do the same stuff but talk about the Dodgers. I cannot support the Dodgers. I'm sorry no no. No, it's fun. It's just about how people don't stick to their allegiances. Can't even be seen. No, it's fun. It's TV. It's it's not. Tick tock. No one will I know that my professors Amy GI can't do that? I can't do it. I'm sorry. Yeah, and you guys are loyal fans. How important is loyalty? Loyalty is everything I I rock with San Francisco all the way like it's just orange and black just looks so much better than the blue to me. Is that right? Who is the black? That actually goes with your eyes really well. So hang in there, give it a try. My Mama didn't raise no Giants fan, go dodgers. How'd that feel terrible? Well, sometimes you can be too nice.

What do you do without your ****? To meet us, I'll walk back to the track. Pack a battery. The hard drive on the sled could make it there and back fat too. Mom. I think I understand now. Why you had to leave me in Chicago? Watch Snowpiercer Monday nights on TNT. Say hello to Jennifer Connelly. Hi Jennifer. How are you? How are you, Sir? Nice to see you. I'm doing well. It's great to see you too. You know, I don't know if your husband mentions these sorts of things, but he was with us last month talking about Wanda vision. I know from this very same room I think, yeah, that you're like official TV talk show spot spot this spot and then elsewhere, you know we don't hear the the cellos and violins and all that kind of stuff. Paul told us that you took him to vote for the first time as an American. Yeah, I was first. I was officially his first and you know, in a season of few excursions I think it kind of qualifies as a hot date, you know. Seems like you really enjoyed doing it. It was great. Well, it was a momentous election. And what? You know, what an election to start with as a as a newly American citizen? Yeah, so yeah, we're really excited to be there. Did he get the sticker and did he wear it around sticker as soon as we got home the kids took the stickers. We got them back. They we had. We had the little wristbands, how were the kids doing with this lock down? Are they going nuts in the house? The kids have been amazing. I have to say they're extraordinary and I'm so, you know, it's it's been amazing having the time with them. But yeah, you know we're trying to find creative ways to spend time in our house all together. What's a creative thing that you do in the house to pass the time? Well, Paul, I think he was talking to you about he's been gardening in the basement with Agnes. They have this aerogarden they've been doing that and I I I too have had a basement project which is the kids and I turned the basement into a roller disco. When you have a ball on mirrored ball and everything like that have lights, we have oscillating lights and. And so many lights you know like multi colored hanging string lights with stars and are the lights screwing up Paul's gardening project down there. I think it's still going. It's still working, so it's the world's first combination nursery roller disco you've got. I can't even imagine having a basement clean enough to roller skate in to be honest with you. No, I mean, you know it's kind of like trying to escape through a pinball machine 'cause there are definitely some obstacles, but you send us some photographs and I'd like to add. But before I ask you about them, I, I'm tell us what you did and this is. This was a little family adventure that you went on. Oh yeah, this is another another like creative things to do at home project, but this was at our up in the country. We have a place in Vermont. We've had for a number of years and. So we on our last trip on the kids last school break we we were up there and we made a snow cave. We dug a big snow cave that we actually wound up sleeping in and there you go. Here's a photo. You can have a sense of the size where we actually had a couple of chambers and then a tunnel. Here's our dog Wallace coming through the tunnel. Is that flat or are we looking down into the earth? You're looking straight through. OK, so this is actually Paul's legs and boots, and in the back of Wallace there there's another room behind that. So this is the the corridor between those who had a multi room snow cave that you constructed. And this is me. This is me in Agness, getting ready for bed. We've brought an air mattress in there and some little Eli. Handles in there. Well, you had a sleepover in a cave? Had a sleepover and we slept in the snow cave. Oh wow, that seems very dangerous. It was OK. We made it. It was great. It was so much fun and you were down there so long that you became pregnant. It seems as well. Yeah, this is the last time that I slept in the snow cake. Valley, so it's a bit of a family tradition. We've been doing this for some time. Whenever we get a a big dumping of snow, it's like you're smuggling drugs over the border to Nogales or something there. So you are literally a Snowpiercer. This is not just your television show, you are. I was feeling kind of smug. I was feeling like I'm. This is pretty sporty of us and yeah, we came back to the city and Tom Cruise burst my bubble 'cause I went and saw I saw Top Gun. The screening of Top Gun. Oh the new one. Amazing wow exciting and how did Tom Mercer bundle? Well, there is a promo for the new Mission Impossible and a stunt that he does so Tom Cruise doesn't. Other death defying stunts in this movie and you know you watch that and suddenly you're like, yeah, maybe I'm not so cool. Maybe this is OK visit well, I think you're somewhere between Tom Cruise and Ted Cruz. Think of it that way, you know. So your show what was happening in that clip that we saw because was the cameraman drunk it it 'cause the child was a little bit out of focus there. Was there a reason for that? Well, you know, I think that over the course of the season and really the last season, Melanie is sort of coming back to her up sort of more authentic self and she's really confronting her past and she's all alone in this research station and she's visited by some folks. And so it may be a graduation for those who don't know what's happening on this show, everyone. Is it's basically an apocalyptic premise with everyone is now living on a train. All human beings still alive are living on a very long train. Yeah, that's pretty crazy. And do you think maybe I know you got picked up for a third season already. They will move it to a cruise ship or something more comfortable. I don't know would that be better or worse? I'm just I'm just looking out for you. I don't know. Yeah, I guess yeah, you're right. Yeah, like the 30th time you do the mambo with a bunch of strangers I guess that would get tiring. Well, it's very good to see you. I'm glad you guys are coming up with interesting things. I feel like I'm boring now I'm gonna go dig something with the children. Jennifer Connelly Snowpiercer is Monday night 9:00 o'clock on TNT. Thanks, Jennifer will be back with Kevin Garnett. Hi, I'm Jimmy Kimmel. An evil wizard has trapped me inside this YouTube video. Click subscribe to help me escape."

Marisa Tomei Doesn't Understand the Spider-Man Multiverse | The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon
http://www.youtube.com/fallontonight

#FallonTonight
#MarisaTomei
#JimmyFallon","Welcome to the show. Thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it. Thanks for having me. Yeah I this is a a big big weekend for you, which is interesting to me. I did not know this your your goddaughter hosted Saturday Night Live? Yes she did so so Zoe Kravitz Zoe Kravitz. She killed it, she killed me. It was fantastic. We have a picture of you and as you and Lisa and baby Zoe. Oh yeah, well, you can't really tell. It's hard. No, you can't tell that. Yeah, that's right there exactly, yeah, and why I'm wearing a towel on my head. I do not know. Yeah, I must be chilly. World is that where? Yeah, well, we met before a different world actually. Well, you did. Yeah we in a yeah in a like an acting workshop did you? What did you give? Did Zoe ask for any advice on how to host? You've hosted silent live. I did many moons ago and she did. She doesn't need any of us she's she's got it. She's just got it right there to cheer her on for advice. I ask her advice on anything. I'm like Joey just. Exactly the way around. Yesterday marked the 30th anniversary of my cousin Vinny, which is one of your great films that we all love. When you're doing that, when you do that movie, when you were filming it, did you have any idea? Would be that big of a hit or that you would win an Oscar or no? I was just happy to have a job. I don't know who is the person who thinks I'm gonna win an old scuba. Yeah yeah what's that Kona? Yeah, are you walking around with like? Him the biggest movie I mean ever. I mean, I think Vice President Kamala Harris said that that's her favorite movie. Kamala Harris. Yes, that's her favorite movie. My cousin Vinny loves it, they they teach it in in, in colleges, in law school classes that I knew that part I knew. Yes, a lot of many lawyer have kind of used that line on me. Did they ever ask you to come in and like, speak, ask me to come in and speak? They asked me other things. Yeah, that's why, yeah? You've been, you've been, you've won, and you've been nominated for many, many awards. But there is an honor that I'm not sure if you know about. There's a sandwich named after you, the world famous Leonie's Deli in Brooklyn, oh, really, I don't know. It's very exclusive club, so. On the sandwiches, let's tell me if you like this fried eggplant. I like it. Fresh mozzarella love it. Bread crumbs Lovett and mushroom stuffing. Not in a sandwich. Oh no. Mushroom stuffing he's crew like no, not a mushroom fan. Well, I I like what about yourself? I do not like mushrooms. I don't like mayonnaise either. Yeah. Oh yeah. I mushrooms mayonnaise. It's the only thing I don't. Yeah, I don't enjoy those. Yeah, but we we well if we could talk to those guys I figured. If you've never heard about it, maybe you've never tried it. I got one with no muss, no mushrooms. Oh, I got two of them. Actually, I figured you could try your own Marisa Tomei on The Tonight Show. Mercy, to me eating a Marisa Tomei. We have napkins for us and everything. We have an app I feel like this is going to be offered no support. Best friend where you been? I don't lean over with a sandwich. This can't do it like right here. No, you can barely could barely even talk when you can. We talk about Spiderman. No, we won't. You were fantastic in this and and really, you're always you're great in all of them. It's made almost. I know it's made almost $2 billion worldwide. I mean, there's a giant movie. It's the third highest grossing movie in history. It's so cool. I mean, is that really a great movie too? I loved every single second of it you play. May Parker. I love. I love you. I love Tom Holland. I love Zendaya. I couldn't get enough of every single person in this movie I go. I don't want it to end. I want to keep going on and on. Is it tough to do those movies knowing that you can't spoil anything or talk about anything? Well, yes, at first it is because. We have to sign a lot of things and it's all under secrecy. I'm friends. Will ask. Our family members will ask about it, but you're happy it's out. I'm happy it's out. I'm happy it's out now but I don't have to keep that secret anymore. I mean, I, I wouldn't bother you with questions like if I saw you on the street you wouldn't. No, I just like I'm cool would you just like I I wouldn't do it. 'cause I I already know the thing the answer is, yeah Jimmy don't make me do this yeah so I wouldn't do it. And then after seeing it. Spoiler There are some spoilers. Yeah yeah yeah. I mean maybe a few people don't know yet, so we can't. We still get that. Still can't tell. Yeah, yeah. Captain coming on. Can we talk about this? We can talk now. Could do with that. Yeah that we can, I mean. I have no idea what he's talking about. The the the the fact that there is a multiverse. Oh yes there is a multiverse. OK, we can say that yes yeah I don't wanna for any fans out right? Yes there is a multi verse if you haven't been to that was part of the secrecy though. That's true. That was part of the secrecy originally. Now a lot of people know, yeah, but the thing was if anyone asked me about it I would have nothing. I don't understand the multiverse myself. So you couldn't spoil it, even like I don't know what it is director John like. And so where am I now? OK, what can you explain to me one more time. Yeah, well knowing that there is a multiverse, yeah what do you think you're done with this sandwich? No, I can go for it. I actually really. No no no. Mama. Maybe not. Do you think that? The things that you would ever do. Would my Parker be in a multiverse? Thing would you ever want to tell me what I would love to come back and be be part of that I want to be a different movie. Yeah yeah you would do it. Yeah, there's history there too. May Parker hooks up with Ant man and one of them. Well I mean she's a standalone character of course, but yes, of course there are. There are more avenues to explore. Alright, I'm gonna root for that right now. Is there anything my teeth? I would tell you no, you look good. I wanna show everyone a clip. His Marisa Tomei, not the sandwich in Spiderman. No way home. Take a look. It just feels so dumb. I didn't realize you were miserable, was really fun. That's right. You know, that's why they call it a fling and we flung. It was fun. I could have been more fun. I could be fun. Hang out again. I should see what no, no, no, no, no no no. What I do it's always coming and going it's not. I don't know what to do. Marissa, tell me everybody. Spiderman no no. Starting tomorrow."

Alicia Keys on Her Graphic Novel Girl on Fire and Her Athleta Collection | The Tonight Show
http://www.youtube.com/fallontonight

#FallonTonight
#AliciaKeys
#JimmyFallon","Welcome back everybody. We're here with Alicia Keys. You've done so many things, so many cool things. By the way, I can't wait to talk about this because this is just the Radice it. It's awesome. Yeah, I know it's so fun. 15 Grammys. Best selling author. But also you're, you're into the in fashion as well Athleta. Yes, yeah, talk to me about this. So Athleta I love because I'm actually a fan of Athleta as a as a mom as a person who likes to workout, likes to meditate. Just be able to have that kind of soft. Sweet energy, but what I love about them the most is that they're all about body consciousness and body positivity and body diversity. And so we created a limited edition collection that we're doing together and it goes from all the way up to three X in size, which I think is so important to be able to find yourself in the store. And it's all about powerful colors and boldness and really empowering women to feel incredible so that you can throw on your little fit. Go to the gym, take your kids to school, go. Take a brunch and still be fresh. Yeah and powerful the whole time. What do you see that looks so cool? I'm like oh, how do you only you could? I mean it's awesome athleta.com and check out the Alicia Keys, what you what you did and then can we just talk about this? This is so cool and I just told you this. I had the book 'cause I know you're coming on right? I went to the bookstore this weekend. Yeah shout out to book Hampton. They had a big big display of your book and it looked great. It was awesome and I was like it's just like and it popped out and I was there with my girls. And I'm like this is great what you're doing. I love this. This is a graphic novel. It's my first graphic novel. I love it so much. I think it's a beautiful way to introduce kids to just continuing to fall in love with words and reading. And I've been so grateful to have fallen in love with words and that's why I'm a songwriter and why I'm a storyteller because I I love words. So when you meet Lolo her name is Lolo. She's from Brooklyn, she's raised by a single father who is also raising her brother. Her mother is actually not around as you read the story. You'll find out why. And her brother was racially profiled and attacked by a police officer and she got so upset she wanted to protect him and she just didn't know what to do and she realizes at that moment that she has these special powers. This kinetic energy that could actually hurt you very badly and she's trying to figure out what do I do with this energy. How do I harness it? How do I use it? Am I crazy and and the whole book is really a metaphor to to the superpowers we all have and trying to find our way to harness it way to see the reaction. We get from teenagers and kids and parents. Yeah, reading and watching a kid read your stuff. It's like it's crazy. It's game change you go. Wow, I can't. We're so lucky to be able to do something else but good good on you for doing the song girl on Fire has been such a powerful statement and I wrote it when I didn't feel on fire. I wrote it when I felt like I couldn't make it. When I when I saw my friends and my family members feeling as women feeling defeated and reminding us that there is nothing that stops us, we are on fire and so the seed is transformed into a book. That can hopefully do that for so many others. It's like I'm super grateful that's what I'm talking about here. That is Alicia Keys. Thank you so much for being here in person. I missed you. I missed you, but Congrats on everything. At least your keys. Everybody grow on fire is out now."

Zac Efron Keeps Taking His Shirt Off For Seth Rogen
http://www.youtube.com/fallontonight","Did you party a lot on neighbors that look like the most fun movie to make? It was incredible. Man. It was weird, but great in the movie they not only good, you're great in the movie. I love it. I keep telling everybody. It's the best movie I've seen in a long long time. Dude, thanks 'cause it's so funny but it's actually charming as well. Well, that's F man Seth. It's all about Seth. Seth is like incredibly honest I am. Since the first time I saw knocked up he I've idolized that guy and I think that. It was really cool the way it all happened. Is he sorted his came up to me pitched me this idea and it sounded ridiculous, but I just trusted him. Did he write it for you? He didn't write well, he didn't write it for me. I wish I wish he did. I mean now the idea of the premises. Seth and his wife have a little baby and they live in a suburban home and next door their neighbors move in and it's a frat. Now you're shirtless in a lot of the movie, yeah? Again, when I say I'm shirtless, I don't get that reaction now. See there you do. Yeah, I know I had to. I had to beg for it yeah yeah but I heard Seth was thinking take her shirt off for no reason. Yeah I know like constantly and I like idolize Seth this is like my hero yeah honor to work with him I would do anything in his command literally like he could. He would say just Zack shirt off at the scene and I'd be like OK. Yes Sir. Eventually I realized that like the cameras weren't really even pointed my direction. Like we're in a scene. We've already shot coverage for it, and I had my shirt on and like it's outside and he was just with me. You can say that on TV, sorry. Sorry. And make edits later. Sorry about that it it is an irreverent movie as well as charming, but it's great. And I gotta say the fight scene you and Seth have a crazy drag out fight scene and you also have a fight scene with Dave Franco too. Yes, did you break your hand? I did. Yeah, it's crazy. We did all our own stunts for this fight scene and I have a fight scene. How did you break in in that fight scene? Well, it was a standoff between basically he sleeps with my girlfriend. I saw the movie. Yeah yeah OK, but I saw the fight but you don't punch his face. No, I grab his balls really hard and he grabs mine. We sort of have. We're gonna cut this interview down in like 2 seconds. That's how you broke your hand. Whatever we have a standoff and yeah, so I don't know what it is. Man something happened those Franco brothers just have balls of steel. Alright, very good let's just stop it right there, but I did legitimately break my hands and yeah, it's understand. Yeah there's one you, you and Seth are the giant fight this gosh everything is so funny in this movie that little tiny jokes. But there's one thing we're Seth throws Christmas lights and like wraps it on your leg and Yanks you back in the room. Yeah, and that was your fighting you go. You're fighting him. You go. How did you do that? And you know, I don't know, you know why? Because that actually happened. Like he literally, he flung and I went how the excuse me? Apologize, I'm sorry. You seem to you seeing the show before have you. Oh my goodness. I wanna show everybody a clip is Zac Efron Seth Rogen. They're having a drunken conversation about their favorite Batman from the movie neighbors in theaters this Friday. Who's Batman to use? And can you think of Batman? He's Batman? Are you kidding me? Christian Bale, Christian Bale, Michael Keaton is Batman to me. Where is she? Welcome back Michael Keaton Batman. Just like hey, I'm Batman. No I'm Batman no dude Batman this is what Batman sounds like I'm counting on it. Zac Efron, go see neighbors and dinners everywhere this Friday."

Biggest IMAX screen in New York City and it's worth every second go I. I don't know how you did the thing. I I I can't hear only Tom broke. I broke his ankle or he broke his leg doing this. One scene I go which seen this is like there's like 20 moments ago. That's where Brooke is like so that's where I know Oh no that's to see where Brooke is like. Oh no maybe did he break his like in this dance hall scene dancing I don't know when you break. Which one did you break your leg on that?

No one doesn't like you anymore. It's fantastic. I don't know what's real. What's a stunt? What's that? It's dude, I I'm talking about car chases, boat chases, motorcycle chases, running, chases.

Las Vegas, NV 89105","And President Trump, who had aspirations to loosen restrictions by Easter, has now also extended White House guidelines. We will be extending our guidelines to April 30th. Oh my God, 30 days. Hell no. The nation's top infectious. Seriously don't know how much more of this I can take. I am so already literally gonna die from boredom and this is some straight. Also, does anyone have extra toilet paper? I'm tired of being alone and watching movies in my home and I don't know what to do. All the games I play I feel the same. Crossing men, can we get something new? I hate to paint origami puzzles for straight book. No way 'cause I am not home school. Black working out or cleaning up the productive stuff is just not putting. There's just nothing to do. Sitting and chilling staring up into the ceiling and millions in the kitchen watching silly little kittens matters. Kitchen with the fish and distant fishing without missing, really missing the feeling of grill. And even if I never did, I know I could finally clean my shoes. Then again on Instagram. My friends are taking shots of booze. Why not? There's nothing, nothing anyone of us can do. Can learn a skill or frechter mirror. Look up anything we choose 'cause there's just nothing here to do. I could fix that clock that's an hour off. Tick tock in my shirt, different spot, but that's just too hard to do. Put a blanket border. Alison card, construction paper, shadow art and draw my own tattoo. Flip flop trick shots being wanted. Go swinging doggy sing a song. Rick Ross, there's nothing to do. Yeah, there's people dying at stock market crash inside, but hey, I'm important too. Can't believe this is happening. I'm so sick. It's not that bad, but I hate that though. Warranty. They even care about our happiness. This is so not, I mean like a bad one. If anything is there just nothing. And I'm getting kind of fat. Didn't see or talk to anyone today. Just binge watch that Tiger King show in my pajamas. #introvert #home bodies. Hashtag perfect day. But I'm serious, not everybody be safe. Stay home, cook rice."

Download the TEEHEE app for iPhone and Android here:
iPhone:http://goo.gl/KXLz9j  
Android: http://goo.gl/RQZUKR","Hey guys. The hell start this over real quick. Hey guys, so by now I'm sure all of you have already heard about all the drama and controversy around. You know, Steve Harvey making the jokes called Asian men. Basically he made some jokes on his show about Asian men and how they're not attractive and this is what it looked like. Do you like Asian men? No, thank you. And obviously there was a lot of drama that followed. There was two different sides of people. Either you know attacking Steve Harvey saying he's racist for making those jokes or people actually defending him and saying, you know he's a comedian and Asians need to learn to just take a joke. And even though I'm Asian and I should be biased. And I really thought about it. I wasn't personally offended by what he said, but I'm not saying what he said was right. I'm just saying, for me personally, I I don't get offended by things like that. I've been hearing in my whole life. Obviously I can see why Asians were offended and are upset about this, and I have to admit I was upset too, but probably for a completely different reason. I wasn't upset by the fact that he was saying Asian men are unattractive. I was upset for just two reasons. First of all, the double standard that exists when it comes to making racist jokes like in our society, it's almost OK to make jokes about Asians like this. I mean, could you imagine if we switch the rows and we had one Asian man playing Steve Harvey and said the things that he said? But about black people on national television? Excuse me, do you like black men? No, thank you. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that Asian guy's career would be over and he probably getting death threats. He'd probably not be able to book another job. There would be significantly more outrage than there was about this Steve Harvey thing, but since the joke was about Asians, it's not as big of a deal because, you know, it's just a joke. I mean, Asians are like the punch bags of society. I could understand if this was like the first time that this ever happened in mainstream media, but let's be real. These kinds of things happen to Asians all the time. I mean, remember during Linsanity and ESPN wrote about Jeremy Lin and he titled the article, a ***** in the armor, obviously making reference to the fact that Jeremy is Asian. And yes, there was a lot of outrage for that. I'm not denying that, still. Again, there were still people with defending the fact that it was a joke, but my point is the fact that anybody would actually think it's OK to title an article, a ***** in the armor when you know it's a non communic sports related article. It's kind of ridiculous. I mean the word change is basically like the N word for Asians. You think anybody would dare to publish the article if they switch out the word ***** with the N word? Of course not, because society and mainstream media has taught us that it's not OK to make black jokes, but it is OK to make Asian jokes. And Steve Harvey is a comedian. It's his job. In fact, if I had to list my favorite black comedians, you know from greatest to worst, Steve Harvey wouldn't be the last one, you know, I'd probably start the top of the list with like Dave Chappelle. Eddie Murphy, Wayne Brady killing Hearts rock Chris Tucker Glover. Bernie Mac Martin Lauren Tracy Morgan Wanda Sykes the entire wins family make 7UP yours guy. Orlando Jones guy that made the guiding vine Bill Cosby, Steve Harvey and then Bill Cosby after the rape allegations. So see Steve is still not at the bottom. Must be real. The guys funny when you got jokes that are straight fire like this one. I don't even like Chinese food. I don't eat what I can't pronounce. Because Chinese food is often in another language C. So sometimes they pronounce things differently and what she said what Steve saying. It's a good job. The funniest part to me is that, you know, as a comedian, he didn't just laugh at his own joke. He was dying from his own joke. I mean, it looked like it was the funniest joke he's ever told or heard. Then again, maybe he wasn't even making a joke. I mean, Chinese food is hard to pronounce. It actually made me kind of curious and I I started thinking like what would it be like to have someone like Steve Harvey, you know, at a Chinese restaurant for lunch? I can't eat anything here. I can't pronounce one thing here, but I wanted to say change Chong Ling Long. It just says spring rolls. Look at this one. Look at this one swing song pong the sweet and sour pork. It's literally 4 English words. What is it? What is it say? Chow Mein. Peking roasted duck. You might have actually said that one correctly for Nope, you're on the drink menu that says Pepsi. Any one thing in this entire country if you can't even pronounce those, there's nothing you can eat in this entire world. Bioworld more like the entire runner up. Yeah, I can't eat anything from this planet, let alone any other planet in this entire runner up you trying to say universe. Oh yeah, my bad. I always mix universe and runner up so I guess we just won't eat lunch then huh? How about we just go to cook? What yeah go ****. It's easy to pronounce so we can go eat it. **** if you want are you swearing at me right now with the restaurant? You know they have like those the gravy mashed potatoes, corn, you know, big old bucket of a a chick fried chicken with a wedding red stripes in the picture of that old guy Collingdale Bernie Sanders on it. I mean KFC. Wow, I cannot believe you just said that you're the one because I'm black. You assume I like KFC, you racist. That was a horrible Steve Harvey impression. I know, I apologize and I know that wasn't a good joke to end on either. So I apologize for that to see, but at least I admit when I have bad jokes. Now I should also say that Steve actually did apologize already. It was a typical PR apology that every celebrity does when they mess up, and you know, he doesn't really mean it because you know when the backlash first started coming. He literally said this kind of beating me up on the Internet right now for no reason, but. You know that's life, right? Please Steve Harvey alone. But anyway overall. Hi there, Steve Harvey was making a lame, tasteless, overused joke that Asians have been hearing all their lives. Or he actually meant what he said and he really does believe that you know, women aren't attracted to Asian males, it's one or the other. And we all can agree that it was just a bad tasteless joke because we know he's not a racist. I mean, he just had a meeting with the President of the United States. So how can he be racist? But our jokes aside, I decided to actually do my own research and see if you know, maybe Steve was on to something. Maybe women don't like Asian men. So what I did is what any logical person on the Internet would do. Taking it to the streets. Excuse me, miss, could I ask you a few questions? It'll only take 5 minutes. Gonna ask you a few simple questions. My first question. If you had to pick between these two individuals, who would you consider to be more attractive? A or B? Probably BA or B? I'm going to have to go with BI. Would go with B. What I'm not gay man in terms of attractiveness like who would you? I like The Walking Dead so sweet be yeah and if you had to pick one of these two individuals, who would you go on? A date with Air BB I'm gonna have to go with B again of course be I love John Cho serious. I mean guess B. Which one would you consider to be sexy or A or BB probably be definitely be no bro be I guess you would have come across one of these next two people randomly on the street right now. Who are you most likely to kiss? A for sure I'm going to have to go with a. Are you sure, yeah. At the definite A. So yeah, the findings were inconclusive. Probably have to just try again another time. Stupid girls."

Android: http://goo.gl/RQZUKR","Hey guys, sorry I didn't post a video last week. You follow my newly made Snapchat you know that I was in Hawaii for a wedding. And no, I'm not saying that just to plug my Snapchat. I hate it when people are constantly promoting their own snap snap snap. The real Ryan Higa. So yeah, I was in Hawaii for a wedding and why I'm so dark right now. So I apologize for not posting. And also I'm sick. But anyway today I'm gonna be talking to you guys about having to break bad news to people. It's literally one of the hardest things that you have to do in life, yet it's something that we all have to do. I honestly think it's harder to deliver bad news to someone than it is to actually receive it. And if you've been in that situation, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Breaking Bad news to people just sucks. It's one of the worst feelings ever, which is why I came up with this video to not just help you but myself as well. Here's some tips and techniques to make it a little easier on you guys the next time you have to break bad news to someone. Look first up, we got probably the most common technique that people use the good news and bad news technique. If you have to deliver bad news to people, you gotta give him some good news as well to cheer him up. There's no matter how bad the bad news is, there's always good news. You just have to find it. I got some good news and bad news when he first give me bad news. Well, you know how I just left to go get us lattes from Starbucks. So in the parking lot I kind of hit a kid. What are you serious? I mean, I fled the scene, but they definitely have your license plate on file and they're probably on the way here. Now. You kidding me right now, but they're still good news. How could there possibly be? Any good news? I got the lattes. Oh yeah, that's right. They spilled when I hit that kid. The figure. Now there's different levels of bad news. Obviously some are worse than others for this technique. All you have to do is give fake terrible news right before you give the actual bad news. So like comparison, the actual bad news is not that bad. Hey G, They're not making a frozen 2. That sucks, and also I kind of ran over your dog on the way here what. But wait before you get mad they are making a frozen 2. Your dog is still dead, though the cliche technique, one of the worst ways you can break bad news to someone, is by just surprising them. With this technique, you're going to give them a warning that bad news is coming so that they can mentally prepare for it. All you have to do is start your conversation off with a very cliche line such as yeah, there's a there's no easy way to say this, but. Indubitably, indubitably indubitably indubitably what does that work indubitably? Yeah, that it means, you know, to be without a doubt or or for sure I know what it means. But why are you trying to say it, oh, because your girlfriend is cheating on you? What Are you sure, indubitably, indubitably man there really is no easy way to say that word the good news, bad news, and even worse, news technique. Sometimes, when you have really, really bad news, you don't want to overwhelm the person. So you're gonna want to break it up into pieces. With this technique, you give it to them in part. So instead of giving them extremely awful news, you just give them bad news and. Even worse news like we mentioned earlier, it doesn't hurt to sprinkle a little good news in. There wasn't a sprinkle. I don't know what that was. So I have some good news, some bad news and some even worse news. Which idea first the good news? I guess the good news is that your son is still alive, so still alive. What happened? Well, that's the bad news. Do you want to know that now or I thought you wanted? Does it matter? Tell me what happened. OK, well, the bad news is your son has been hit by a car in a Starbucks parking lot. Why didn't you tell me that immediately you asked for the good news first. Not the bad saying he's still alive without even knowing isn't good news. You haven't even heard that even worse. How could it be worse? Well, the even worse news is that I lied about the good news. He's dead. It's not fun with it. Now, if you still can't figure out how to use these techniques, I made it even easier. I asked a bunch of you on Twitter for some of the worst news that you ever had to break. And judging by those tweets I came up with some of the most common situations that people find themselves in when they have to break. Bad news, here are some premade examples that you guys can use when you're in that situation, like when Grammas tests come in, you got your grandmother's test results back and, well, she passed. So she's going to be OK, but you just said she passed and she got. Aplus Way 8 Plus which passed away the worst news you could possibly break at a wedding and you Dana do you take Gregory to be your husband and by the power invested in me I now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride. Wait, I have something to say. I have terrible news. There's no easy way to say this so. The Wi-Fi is down. When she refuses to give Star Wars a chance. What are you doing? You know how I love Star Wars and I believe in the force. And ever since we've been married, I've been trying to get you to finally watch it. Still not going to right. Which is why I believe this belongs to you. What is that? What may divorce be with you when you get her to break the bad news for you can't just do the same move over and over and still win. Hey, you're cheating. I really am though. When is the highlight of his day? The park is closed today. When you're the boss, Sir, what are you doing? I'm gonna light this ring around you on fire, why? 'cause I'm firing you what? OK, obviously these are jokes. I took it a little too far. You're not gonna light someone on fire. This video actually started off kind of realistic and then I had too much fun with it. Sorry guys, but anyway, truth is there is no easy way to break bad news to some best way you can do it is by just getting straight to the point. Don't beat around the Bush. It's like ripping off a band it you just do it one time really fast and get it over with and you also hope that you're not hairy 'cause that hurts more. Look I have to get back to work in 10 minutes. What is it could be quick I promise. OK, well then what's up? So I have some bad news. Your newspaper you got wet outside, so it's pretty bad news now you scared pain first. Second, I thought it you really meant bad news. Well, to be honest I actually do have more bad news. From your neighbors lawns. I don't know if you want to give this to them or. To listen, there is something I need to tell you and it's pretty upsetting. It's setting. What is it? I just told you it's upsetting you, kind of slouching. You really should sit up 'cause you're back. It's not good for your back, you know. But anyway, the real reason why I called you out here is because, well, your parents. It's not looking good. My parents. What do you mean? It's not looking good? Your parents they they've definitely seen better days. What happened? It's just your parents is just a bit messy. Just tell me what happened. What is it? Your hair, my hair. What does this have to do with my parents? You talking about it? Your hair is everything to do with your appearance. I think it's your hair. It could also be your posture. You kind of slouching. Again, you went back to doing, wanted to tell you something up, sitting again, so you remembered to are you kidding me? Are you serious? I mean, that's two different answers. It's no. And yes, 'cause no, I'm not getting you. And yes, I am serious. You are still slouching. Is this supposed to be funny to you? Is this supposed to be a joke? Breaking Bad News is not supposed to be funny. Well, I know that it's under drama. Thriller what? Spence yeah, Breaking Bad. I know it's not a comedy, it's not supposed to be funny. It's a serious show and you do know that the show is over, right? So there's no new episodes so it wouldn't be under the new category. Where are you going? I'm going back to work. I'm so over this you made me worry for nothing you made it seem like you were going to give me bad news and you didn't. Technically I did give you bad news. Remember your neighbors bad news too. Goodbye, OK fine. Just just wait OK just I really do have something important to tell you. Where did God Ryan? If this is a. It's not, it's not OK. It really isn't. Look, I'm sorry I guess I just made all these jokes because I I just. I don't know how to break bad news to people and I just hate seeing people get upset. Especially people actually care about part of life. Ryan, everyone has to do it. I can take it. You just have to be honest with me and stop with the joking around. OK, well earlier in the video it wasn't a joke that lied. Something really happened to my parents. No no. Not that. Are you really cheating on me? No, of course not then. What is it? Well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is I already talked to your boss and he said you don't have to go back in today given the circumstances. That's the bad news. You know those bad newspapers from earlier? What about them? They weren't actually soggy from the rain outside, huh? He's firing you. So then goes again so much for watching if you want to see bloopers and behind the scenes please on the left if you want to see the previous video, click the one on the right and if not then you don't have to do anything. Just log onto your phone, go on to Snapchat and check out."

Las Vegas, NV 89105","Hey guys, so Father's Day is coming up in a couple of days or it's tomorrow or today. I don't know when I'm posting this Father's Day is coming up. Or just pat damn it. Take two hey guys. So it's fathers week and I'm gonna be completely honest. I actually wasn't gonna make a Father's Day video because I just did a Mother's Day video and I didn't want it to be too similar. But then all the comments on that Mother's Day video was kind of like. Well now you gotta make a Father's Day video because if you don't, that's sexist. I don't have a mom, so if you don't make a Father's Day video, that's not fair to me. Wow, Ryan, you actually cried in this video. What a little. Yes, I got a little emotional talking about my mom a Mother's Day. I'm sorry, I just have so many feelings. So basically for this video I wanted to do something a little different. When you tell your mom I love you for no reason at all. It's a completely normal thing, and in fact it's a very nice moment. Most times she'll just say I love you too, but for dads, on the other hand, and I don't know if this is just a guy thing, but it's not something you'd say to your dad randomly, at least not for me. And honestly, I know this sounds absolutely terrible, but I don't even remember the last time I told my dad I loved him and don't get me wrong. I love my dad and I know he loves me. It's just not something that we say to each other. It's just a known fact. But then I wondered, what if I told my dad I love you randomly out of nowhere? What would he say? Would he say it back to me? Would it be awkward? Would it be funny? I don't know. There it go. Yeah I love you Dad experiment was born. I told everybody in the TV app to film their dad told them I love you and to record the reaction. I gotta say I had no idea what to expect but I was not let down at all. So before we get started I just want to say thank you to everybody sending a video about all the wonderful dads out there. Happy Father's Day you know we love you we just don't know how to say it. And apparently, neither do you. I love you dad. I love you dad. I love you. I love you why I love you. I love you dad. Love you too. I love you dad. What do you want? Hey Dad, I love you. Aw, thank you. I love you. I love you too. Are you videotaping dad? I love you. Dad, I love you. Baby baby I love you daddy OK, I know that. Love you dad. Now go to that I love you. Dad, I love you. You want. What you do what you want? Nothing you get nothing. Hey Dad, I love you. How you doing? Dead yes Sir, I love you. Dad, I love you. I'm playing my game. Love you. I love you. OK I love you. OK, what's up nothing. Dad, I love you. Turn take my picture. No, it's not. It's dad I love you, I love you. What do you want? Dad, I love you what do you want to do? Costco. Dad, I love you. Why you say that? Say that. Seriously, why? Comfortable. Hello. Hello dad. Hey, what up? What do you say? What a scoop scoop? This is Ryan. This is your other son. Yeah, what's up dude. I'm just calling to say I love you. All right, you're not going to make a video for me. I am making a video for you right now. You're being recorded. Oh, really, yeah, well just your call. But you shouldn't do that. The joke was going to be like telling a bunch of kids to tell their dads. I love you, 'cause you don't normally say that to your dad. That's something you say to your mom. You know it's not something you you say to your son, right? No no, not at all."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2gBU6hKfY,I Cleaned The World’s Dirtiest Beach #TeamSeas,"$1 Donated = 1 Pound Of Trash Out Of The Ocean -  https://teamseas.org/
HELP US REMOVE 30,000,000 POUNDS OF TRASH FROM THE OCEAN BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR!","This is one of the dirtiest beaches in the entire world, and we're going to pick up every single piece of trash on this beach. Starting with this water bottle. One out of millions of pieces of trash. We did it. This will take forever. Bottle me up baby. I'm hungry for your plastic as you can see this is taking forever. Oscar come on in this is Oscar professional beach cleaner. Is this basically how you guys clean beaches? Mainly the big stuff 1st and then we bring a lot of people with sift as well for this little stuff you scoop it into this thing and then shake out the sand and you got a bunch of trash. This right here is the first bag of trash. Hundreds more to go. How do we do this quicker? We just need more people that seem simple. Do you clap for me? There you go on the line here. OK guys, we're gonna be in this stop using the bash. We're gonna clean this up. Groups of four groups of four in this area. Part of me wanted to see if me and the boys could clean up this speech by ourselves and the other part of me realizes that would have taken a year. I could have told you that Jimmy yeah, the oceans putting more trash on the beach. There's so much underwear in the ocean. I'm enacting a new law. Thou shalt not throw your underwear in the ocean. Wait, did you guys already fill up a bag? Yeah, you guys are better than us. They are professionals to be fair. After 12 hours of cleanup, this is what we managed to achieve, which isn't enough. Boys bring it in tomorrow. I'm gonna bring in 10 times the volunteers tomorrow. Tomorrow it's down the next day. I'm helping. Slowly. Mark Rover or Mr. Bean? Make sure you watch until the end of the video to find out how we're going to pick up £30 million of trash. Thank you for coming to our country and help us with this initiative that it's really awesome. Right here, right there stop. He's not stopping. I'm gonna move and this bad boy is 6000 pounds of trash. And now we have £36,000 of trash which weighs the same as 3000 cats or 3T rexes, whichever you prefer. While I was talking with some of the locals, they mentioned that there's a beach down the street that was also very dirty, so I said Nolan with a bunch of volunteers to go clean that beach as well. There's a whole car bumps that car bumper here to this come out of the ocean. People litter weird things. What type of trash have you seen along the beach? Most importantly most commonly is plastics and we see that in every form on the beach here, they ended up removing 12,000 pounds of trash. Which brought us up to a total of £50,000 of trash from just two beaches. Check out this power move watch this OK, that is that how you want us to dump it. Yeah, they're not taking over the team. I'm the team player. Oh yeah, I didn't have to look there you go. It actually kind of works. Yeah. And if you guys look over there, we're actually getting close to the end of the beach. This is what the beach looked like at the start of the video and this is what it looks like with like 20% left. We're getting there. We're doing it. Unfortunately, between the ocean washing up trash to the beach and rivers, bringing in new trash from the mainland. Obviously this beach is gonna get dirty again, but with your guys help we can stop a much bigger issue. We're almost done Jimmy. I know four straight days of picking up trash and just like that we were moved over 60,000 pounds of trash from the world's dirtiest beach. And even though this 60,000 pounds of trash we picked up my seem impressive, there is sadly way too much trash still in the ocean. Two years ago we crushed our goals with team trees and planted 20 million trees and now it's time to do it again, which is why we, along with hundreds of other creators, are launching team. And for every $1.00 you guys stone it like this one, less pounder trash will be in the ocean. But what if I wanted to donate $10 Jimmy? I conveniently have £10 of trash right here that is now out of the ocean, boom gone. You get the point. $1.00 donated is 1 less pound of trash in the ocean and I'd like to personally thank You Tube originals for supporting team season, helping US fund it. They're going to be matching the 1st $400,000 worth of donations, dollar for dollar and we want to remove £30 million of trash from the ocean, which is just so freaking audacious. This only happens if we all work together. Half the money we raise is going towards funding. Volunteer beach clean ups like we did here today. All across the world as well as literally fishing trash out of the ocean and the other half will be used for these trash eating robots that pick up trash 24 hours a day, 365 days a year from rivers that flow to the ocean. Go to teensies.org or click the donate button below this video. Right now, $1.00 equals one last round of trash in the ocean, making real change like this isn't gonna be easy. Donate right now and help us remove £30 million of trash from the ocean before the end of the year. Let's show the world that we want a clean ocean. What are you doing? Get out of here. Go donate."

--------------------------------------------------------------------","This burger isn't real phony. This is what it actually looks like when you order it. That's a sham. This commercial was filmed with a toy car. Just use a real one. We're gonna go behind the scenes of commercials and expose them. Let's see how they make a burger in a commercial right? This seems pretty normal. Oh, wait a minute, you can't eat toothpicks or makeup sponges. They're putting makeup on a burger, making a pretty burger, right? So that's the real burger. That's the commercial. What does that look like? A burger in SpongeBob when it always cuts to real life? You know what I'm talking? Yeah, it does looks exactly like it. Oh, is that how they get the slo-mo fall? I guess that's way cheaper. Hey, that's satisfying. And here I thought they just went into a subway and just drop stuff. I thought it was CGI CGI hurts. Dang it now old spice. I've always wondered how they did this. I thought this was CGI. I'd be surprised, wait? It's all like practical. What am I? What they're moving rooms around him? That's insane and the camera rotates so it looks like Oh my gosh, out of all the things that were CGI, they CGI the chocolate fountain. The thing he's dipping in the chocolate. It's not there. A lot of things that I can get a metal rod. Wait is this how they give her? Oh that makes sense. You can kind of see it a little bit interesting that is impossible standards for women to live up to their hair doesn't fly smack that Doug OK? I like that shot. I like when people drop stuff on the camera, wait a minute. Did he have to cook the camera? It's not a fridge. Pepsi's got a good can. Yeah, Pepsi does have a good. I mean for help for how terrible their soda is. At least woe is how they filmed chasing James Bond. I saw this car in fast and the furious. They had it driving on the ice. I saw a tick tock with it. Oh no, I'm getting chased in the desert for a limited time only agreeing mattress as Queen mattress sets. But not saying mom and pop commercial. Boy oh will give him a name for effort. I'll buy a mattress from. Yeah honestly yo it looked like a commercial from a couple decades ago, but if you're still open I'll buy matches. Hit us up. Making a commercial with only my iPhone. That's cool. Oh that's so cool shot. That's a good shot. iPhones have gotten really good quality over the last few years. It's the sound people where they called Foley artists. Would it be easier just to snap someone's arm in half? Who's offering up their arm? You would have volunteer? Yeah, jokes, I I was gonna say, wouldn't it just be easier just to go to a ranch and just put on Mike by horses feet? I think celery is way easier than using actual human or says she's mid. Hey, it's a Domino's commercial. Wait really. I'm guessing. I'll bet $100 is dumb. Oh wow, I know my Domino's baby order B's burger. You don't need Domino's. We have bees burger. Just go order something. I order pizza if you order pizza. I'm hearing Walt by those are cool shots. Wow, zoom in, that's a good camera. Why don't you have good camera? Zoom in? See, that was crappy compared to that. We're at a wedding. Oh wow geez. What buddy cameras ruined both cameras? That feels bad. That feels bad. Well, that dingus, why didn't your wedding have something like that? I didn't see a guy falling fountain. That's true. Nobody fell in the fountain, exactly. I'm giving her wedding a night out of tent, no fountain falling. I'll try again next time. Oh oh wait, is it following the ball? Oh that's cool. We need to use drones like these more in our videos we have them. The shots don't ever make it in except for this one in squid games. Made it wait. Is this a commercial or a race? A little bit of both probably is that how they film? Yeah helicopter races. 'cause? What else could keep up with it? Yeah, but do that helicopters like he's calling in with it? I wouldn't feel comfortable having that helicopter fly over me. Yeah, especially not near a bunch of fans watching. They're getting just dusted by that car. Oh my God, did you see how close do but see that car just drifting in that helicopter? I don't know if I. Attend safety first. Agreed head habeas Lee. Absolutely worth it. Wait, what is this? Oh my gosh, I don't know why that's crazy, but it is crazy because how smooth it is. I'm too dumb to understand how cool it is, but it is cool. Faces scene from Fast and furious. Wait really cargo out. Yeah car falling under the sky. This is how they filmed that. Yes Sir, practical baby fast and furious does it right there CGI. Things get exploded. That's why these movies are still going babe. Oh my God exposure, explosions, fire, fire be like fire no story, no art just fire story confuse me fire make me happy let's show this one more time I don't know what movie this is but I'm watching it I'm pretty sure it's fast and furious still this is all fast and the furious. I think this is 7 right? Is this GI Joe no? This is also fast and furious. Kid shut up Chris. There's an explosion. Oh look at that. We didn't see that Ford Explorer in the video. Oh, I don't understand what blew up. Oh my gosh, oh see, this is good camera work. You couldn't do that with all these rules and safety regulations. I love that. That's a great shot. Alright, so corn syrup, shortening, shortening, food coloring peak. Put in my watching I don't understand. Is this play-doh? Oh wait, that's fake ice cream what everything I know is a lie so they have to do this because real ice cream would melt because of studio lights. Interesting. They're faking it. Hollywood is just one big lie I'm boycotting. As for now. What is this? A commercial for juice like Minute Maid and see it splashes the juice on and it's like the first refresh again. That doesn't make me want to buy juice. Oh my gosh are you kidding me? This is not a car commercial. No, that isn't real. That's pretty cool. It looks real. This is the power of computers. Man, you're kidding me. The world has gone too far. It's time to go back. What is this oh Doritos? Oh snap, this looks like something Mark Robert though the Super spinny camera machine of death. Honestly, now I want some. Good job Doritos. What is this? Oh, that's nice. Those machines be nice. Oh, it looks like it falls onto the glass. It's a giant ice cube that is a giant ice. It's like half the size of the glass. It's also very nice looking. Cute news forecast, right? Wonder why I don't wear green on TV 'cause I'm always at the Chroma Key. But today when you wear green to work, that's hilarious. Hey pancakes, that's evil. That's not. That's very deceiving. That's where you cross a lot. That's deceptive modestly. I'm suing mess with my burgers mess with anything I don't care don't mess my pancakes man. Oh, you mean they put motor oil in the bank? They did put motor oil on the pancakes? Your momma, your momma has something to say about that mom it's OK. Oh oh, you can tell this is filmed along time ago. You can't do this anymore. You can't just throw a plastic in the street. Oh my gosh, those are bassy balls. You know they did not get all this up either. All that for a commercial woo capitalism baby. It looks cool. Screw the environment. We got a TV to advertise, so they definitely pick them all up. Definitely you think they got those ones that are done in the storm drain? Yeah sure. Yeah, whoever did this commercial exposed oh stop motion. Oh, I always have huge respect for people that do stuff like this. Not only stop motion. Also origami that since this stuff is very impressive, it's one of those things where you think you can do it, but I when I was younger tried to do stop motion with Legos and it is way harder than you think. Can you imagine a little Jimmy film and stop motion Lego movies in his room? What a nerd. On this channel you stop floating hey, take us back to those days I know now I have to recreate speaking Joyner Lucas he CGI people in all that CG look the people in the back are CG how why they just give people honestly would have not been easier just to go to a school. I don't understand why you would CG though. Should it looks so good at the top, I don't believe that CG. Yeah, I refuse to believe it. Hey, another TV commercial, just dump and paint everywhere. No, that's not real. Yes, it is. That's all practical. That's all real let us know in the comments what you think. OK, this is real and the girl literally expands the boundaries of her apartment. Real graphics was created by hand, but it's a tiny model. A terrifying monster. Yeah, terrifying monster. Imagine getting to be that guy. Just being like I haven't watched it visible, man, should I watch it? Let's see I'm 8 now. Yeah, I'm kind of interested. That seems like a good premise. You know what? Everyone if you haven't already hit the subscribe button right now, do it? Let's go watch a movie, alright?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------","This worker is cleaning a McDonald's grill for the first time in five years, and these guys are arguably the best fishers on the planet. Look at him, go. These are the most satisfying workers ever. Look at how satisfying it is to watch these guys fish. This is every man's dream broke. They let me just put the poles in the water and blink a fish out when I go fishing. It's like 4 hours of sitting there drinking a Mountain Dew eating a can of beans. Chris sorry but blocks are falling over bricks. Is this how you lay bricks? Yeah, if you're like a master this is a satisfying work or. Normal worker wouldn't do this. What's the point? Watch watch? Oh, they come back and then wow really is it faster? No. Is it satisfying? Yes, which is perfect. 'cause then we can use it for content? Yeah, if you use oh snap this is satisfying and useful. Wow, so when you rake your leaves, this is how they pick him up. It'll come to my yard man, it'd be funny if you put like eyes on it and it looks like it's like yummy. But if he's actually ever sucked a human in it. Wait is this how they move pineapples? No way is that efficient. It's very efficient. Also, did you know that one pineapple plant only makes 5 pineapples? Then it takes it years to do it look. Wow. Whoa, it's satisfying. Is it safe? No, is it satisfying? Yes? Sure cleaning them thangs crusties or some Chris shoes if I've ever seen it come on man you gotta do me like that you remember when I used to come to school with them shoes just covered in mud and dirt 'cause I would work on the farm all day then just go in and you thought it was cool I didn't think it was cool it's just what I did man you thought it was cool I was amazed before I was a boy that satisfy this is very satisfying whoa that was cool for my male audience. Laser hey if you wanna find tick tock I did one of these ice more more more. I saw this. Oh, you haven't seen this, no. Sabotage, you know they they're tearing it down apparently, and that's the easiest way 'cause it like crumble it. Yeah I saw that tick tock and I read the comments yo it's like that YouTube rewind with chaos out there wow. I don't know what you're saying, but holy crap, that's satisfying. Yeah, this guy is gonna get snowed. That would hurt that was imagine this is like $100 million painting and he's like what you just put this lubricant on it. It'll up the vibrance, it'll help maintain its quality. And then he just does it in the painting. Just our roads. And he's just like like before his eyes. It just like any literally just turned some walks away and runs to Mexico and change his name and never comes back. That's what I would do. Nice, it does look pretty. Now all weed whacking this guy is good with it. Yeah he is nice with it. See you always make fun of me. Jimmy is like why do you cut your grass yourself? Chris and I'm like I like doing it. It's fun but we could be reacting to videos instead. I do it on Sunday afternoon. Those are my time. Jimmy. That's what I do. Your mom fine. She has a busy schedule. I'm sure the weekends are perfect. Alright, we have a Nokia phone and it's versus a belt Sander. It actually is really satisfying to watch it just not exist anymore. We just go into the shadow realm, yo. Why are we doing this? You gotta turn around bro. I mean I know one way to turn around. Just fall down the Cliff. This is that person on the freeway that missed their exit and there's just blocking traffic. Wow, nice, you couldn't pay me money to do that then for the most satisfying part, squeegeeing it off. All the beast burger grills look like this super clean. Never a dirty girl ever gorder Wiesberger. Ooh, ooh yo they're sweeping water they nice nice with it fishing right? What is this? Oh, I would never put my hand under that. Never that's so scary. I like the noise is satisfying Oh my God, Katie watches these energy organizes our entire kitchen and like yeah it's organized but I don't know where anything is now. And then she has these child safety locks on everything and you have to have a magnet to open them and then I can't find the magnet and I'm just trying to get some trash bag. Bro I'm trying to be satisfied right now it it reminds me of going home and not being able to find anything so they should replace those Hershey's bar with a feasible. Fargo by right now he's not com. We got chocolate bar chocolate bars. What the heck? We got chocolate do and they're phenomenal. I see the crystal raindrops falling. It just snowed here and we're not used to snow in my vehicle was covered in snow and you didn't use the leaf blower. I used a broom I I didn't even think to use a leaf blower. I should have used a leaf blower. Daggett, I looked like a idiot out there. Nice nice cartoon is a nice car, right? Cranberries in a napkin. Wow, that red is beautiful. I wish I could drink that. Oh I saw this. This is so cool. Who, who, who, who, who, who, who? Who you gonna throw? He doesn't so satisfyingly he he knows what he's doing it's about to do. He shows you I can't look I can't wait any longer. It's fine you gotta see it look it makes a cup. Imagine drinking a drink out of that you think about it he rims it lets it go see when I did mine I messed up. Apparently you're not supposed to throw it but apparently the Internet likes to see it just, uh, yeah, it's more satisfying when it's natural glass hot glass so it's a snail. Baby child looks like that happened. Dragon Ball ZI was thinking Dragon Ball Z two what am I looking at? There's no chance that we don't get to know what that was. I'm gonna think about that for the next three years and wonder what that was. Oh nice, nice nice. Is this the guy who makes the signs? Sir, Sir, I would offer you 10 grand for that plus the bubble wrap. Can I have it? We'll wait your response with over 50,000 Domino's put down Wow. I remember this mark vision.

All he did was grab Leafs out of the drain and then he just sits back literally. It happens in minutes. The entire Rd is clear so if you wanted to cause destruction just throw some grass on a drain yo if you if you collected enough grass you could just shut down America. Somebody is trying to invade America. They're like what do we need all this grass for and he's like trust me yeah. It's at live on TV. Yeah, Oh my gosh, it's that show that's overrated is that The Simpsons right? Or no, that's South part sorry, I just like I enjoy Rick and Morty, but I'm not like a hyper fan. Uh, it's.

--------------------------------------------------------------------","I found a list of the 20 best water parks in the world. I'll be the judge of that. That number 20 in the list is this water park in Spain? Did you see that dinosaur? I'm a sucker for a theme. It adds a lot to the water part. You know. Oh wow, that's really cool. I think this would get a little higher than 20 if that was the 20th best water park in the world. I can't wait to see number one. My mind is going to be blown now. We're coming in at number 19 in Indonesia. I think we saw this little water slide video. Oh my gosh, it just drops here. This is like when the time warp in Star Wars. Oh, I like this one. You yo, I would just see water. I don't see it alright now I do. Hey it looked like that person had to kind of like feed themselves into it. You know yeah, that would knock it off of it for me. Oh well, you know what's coming up next. It's from Poland you know what they have? Lots of polls. Yeah he got me he knew the joke was coming Oh my gosh whoa. Apparently I've were plots up Frick. Yeah, that looks like whiplash. The ride. I would be panicking. I like this one. This looks still looks like you hit the edge at a weird angle. You just fall off. This guys enjoying it though this one looks a lot more calmer. Oh certain yeah, OK now you got me all right now we're in Malaysia. One thing I've noticed is America has not been on the list yet. They are not doing so hot right now. America sucks, it does. Oh my God, whoa I would be terrified that drop. Who goes to a water park wearing jeans and a shirt? I don't know like I just I couldn't do that. People wanna wear jeans sound slots. I don't wear jeans, don't slide. Guys comment if you've ever worn jeans down a slide water slide, I would expect you to wear jeans down a normal slide wet and wild in Sydney, Australia. And that's what they call me. Because he drinks a lot of water, I do drink a lot of water. Here's your daily reminder to drink water. Yeah, that's the fun slide. Oh, and they all just OK. That's really cool. That looks like you know and Karthik Caribbean, where he had that thing with Oh yeah, like it's kind of organ but not the body part. The state right now. That's Oregon. You're talking the Oregon trail. No, that's a trail. There are a lot of things named organ. Why is there a lot of things they Morgan OU that one kind of like flames? Yeah, I like that. It looks a little safer than the last one, but you could just fly off right there. It didn't have any like guard. Trail you see that it's called the tantrums, but Tucker does when he doesn't get his Dino ranch as he should, the king deserves his Dino ranch. I've watched the one season of Diner Ranch that's available at least 18 times. I thought you were talking about ranch. That tastes like dinosaur. Now this is area 47 in Australia, Austria, not Australia. Come on. What are you doing? Not to be confused with area 51. No, as a military base area 51 is not a water park. The area 47 is a water park. Hey see you can tell this is in a nice country where it's like a cooler climate. 'cause if this was in like Florida, that ride would be 1000 degrees. All I could think of is like this, metal does look a little military and maybe this is just a cover up for a secret base. I'm not letting this go. I think we're on to something. Finally America. It's on the list. Not only America but the most American thing in the world. Florida America. Don't let us down. So this is an A Disney place in Florida. Got a theme going? I like it. Disney is known for their themes tidal wave. That's pretty cool. I'm allergic to that aesthetically. This looks cool. But the other ones looked more fun, like he's not getting much speed. This is the thing though. It's called the rudder Buster. That's pretty funny. Coconut crusher. OK, maybe dizzy gets the dub for fun. The names is out of this world. The ride itself. Did stuff like that would terrify me well if the door opens and you're not pending against the back wall, do you just fall just smack at the bottom and then slowly slide down the rest of the way? Oh see, there's no guardrail on this one look, Oh my God, I would try to touch the top I do every time. It's fun fun fact about this guy right here. He runs a channel called 2 Brides and he has over a million subscribers just filming himself. Going down waterslides. Imagine going to college, getting a good degree, working all your life just so you can get a job and make less than this man. That writes down water slides for a living. Godspeed Water park guy. Oh Oh my God, he's going so fast you can't even tell what is going on. That was insane. I'm next is a Swedish water park. Let's see if we find PewDiePie there. He is. Every Swedish person is just PewDiePie. Yeah, I'll just look the same. I mean so far. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. I'm not impressed. This is cool, yeah, but we've seen stuff. OK, this looks like yeah, OK, there we go. I don't know. I prefer the ring thing more than this. No, this looks like you're going through like somebody: Oh, that's cool. I like this a lot. No this one. This is one of the ones that looks good on paper, but it's not fun to ride down. It also looks like he'd smack your head on one of those rocks. Now let's see what Turkey is capable of, not the food. I thought we were getting Turkey. I was like, no, no, it's a country. It's a snake. Alright, yeah, this is cool yo OK so far Turkey is already underrated. See, this is how you do themes right? Make it cool make it a part of the whole ride. Turkeys getting some dubs here. Yeah oh turkeys getting some good dubs. Alright, so far Turkey hasn't missed yet. Oh and the ramp? That's a higher rate than we've seen two. Now we are in the top 10 greatest water parks on Earth. I'm excited for number one, and what better way to crack the top ten then America would have thought New Jersey would have a good water park Coop, Pepto Bismol pink love it, that's huge. Does that not look disproportionately bigger than the other ones? The tube also looks insanely large. The best 1 #1 #1 number one we need to pause every once a person. You see Shrek and you don't instantly go. Oh yeah, that's number 10 and out of a Dragon's mouth. Oh, it's the dragon that donkey dated lodge. Oh my gosh, that was fast. Whoa, let's jump on over to Germany. Oh my God and then it goes dark. Oh and then green yeah, like how much more could it possibly cost to just change the colors of the slides a little bit like that like that made it 10 times cooler yeah 100% oh yo, this is definitely deserves to be where it is Oh my God that is really cool Hurricane Luke I just he's going. So fast that is insane. Let's jump over to Dubai. Dubai is very very lavish. There's just no world where this isn't the coolest water park. Yeah, you're already getting speed. We're off to a good start. It's great right now, oh. This is kind of claustrophobic though. Right? This is cool. OK this water park maybe should have been a little higher. All right now we're jumping over to Brazil, which I don't think has been on the list yet. No, not yet. I just feel like Brazil has some nice water slides. It's a good climate. This is gotta be big. Oh my gosh, yeah it is big. It is very big. We are officially in the top three Florida. Bring it home for us. Come on Florida. Don't disappoint. They made it. It's like a snowy thing in Florida. That's funny because that would not be possible. I really think that these rides are only in the top of the list. 'cause of their name? 'cause that's funny, but the ride doesn't look that good. OK, now yeah, it's getting better the more he caught summit plummet. Do all the righteous run right? Let's see the next one. If it doesn't rhyme, this is not a cool water park Trojan Trojan toboggan racers. It was hard but you did it and oh, Boggan racers. It doesn't rhyme it doesn't. So guess what that means? Do do water park OK? Everybody actually deserved the number two spot. Let's find out. I'll be the judge. That Dome looks better than I thought. Oh, this probably costs like a trillion billion dollars. This is insane. Are these all real plants too? Yeah, can we go to Germany? Yeah, let's go to Germany. I'm sorry Florida, but I think Germany just they just hook your poo poo. Oh yeah lunch money wait Germany has #2 and #1 this is number one on the list and we waited this entire time for this this better be good. Yeah alright let's let's judge the water slides OK. I like the design. Oh, you're supposed to race with people. Look, there's three lanes that ones like a race with your friends kind of wait a fan, it pushes you. Oh that's cool. OK yeah alright we'll see this is what I'm talking about. Innovation yeah who else is doing this? Oh, a surf slide that's cool I've never seen one of those in my entire Life OK, I'm starting to see why this number one 'cause every other places just dumb.

Text with Sam: (310) 496-8371","From West Hollywood, CA, the only news team that doesn't know what's on the teleprompter before they read it. Anyone who laughs or breaks loses points. This is breaking news. Hello and welcome to breaking news the show where we have no idea what we're about to say and we aren't allowed to smile or laugh. I'm Megan Heaven and I'm trombone 22. Our first story today. First story today though. Fred Websters dictionary. I've done it again. They've announced their new list of words that we must add into our vocabulary or face punishment. He's words include Argonauts, a person whose parents conceived them while watching the 2012 film Argo. Stan, the name of my dermatologist who won't get a drink with me and fluff, stir a fluffer looking for work on Friendster. You guys remember Friendster? I doubt it. My son created Friendster, and I barely remember it. That little twerp, your son, is a twerp. Thank you. Now to the traffic report with baby thump. Thank you for the record. I'm an adult. Even though my name is baby pump traffic is slow so slow today. Come on, give it to me how slow it is. It traffic is so slow that hundreds of cars are filling up with farts, but it's too hot to open a window to let the farts out so all the totes are condensing inside everyone's cars. I don't get it. I do and it makes me a ***** little EpiPen. And to make things worse, all the radio stations are playing nonstop clips of Terry Gross yawning. Oh my God, that will never stop. Yes, it's Megan. So if you're getting in a car right now to go drive to work, I'd suggest avoiding the 85, the 101 and the 4:20. Oh wait, that last one is my favorite weed integer me to my suggestion. Take the 10 and get off at exit 34 and stop by Denny's and get slammed by pancakes. Denny's the home for people banned from IHOP. Thank you baby bump. Well it's day 120 of our never ending State Fair. Today organizers are holding the annual biggest. All contests that sounds like a contest. My husband could win. What do you mean by that? Well, I mean that my husband is a is a large hog is a large hog of a man a very round gentleman who snuffles his little snout allowed around in his plate looking for delicious morsel to eat. In that way. He's very similar to a large hog and I think that you'll find that they have a lot in common, in fact. Is there something there's a large hog? I think he could win that competition. Disgusting, we now have Maximilian Cungus reporting from the County Fair. Cungus, thanks to two. I'm here at the County Fair where they just concluded the biggest hog dot contest. The winner was a piggy named Tony Hawk, owned by my guest Tina Hawk Tina. Congratulations on your big pig. What are 10 things you feed it? Oh, I feed it a lot of stuff asparagus, milk, water juice. Orange juice liquids. Diet pills Coca Cola accent egg salad and tuna salad. Interesting, I'd have thought you'd have fed it. Salmon Salman Rushdie salmon Diane Samsonite luggage. Salmon again halfway through. Sam Goody gift cards Sam. And Diane again, Diane already. That's what you would have thought. That's what I thought. You have three more and they said all's and things. So far I thought you would have felt it milk and I said milk. Oh you said milk interesting cool cool how about milk and cookies you said milk already cookies and peanut butter and Jelly sandwich and a Tobler own cungus. I'm told that you and Tina got to spend some time riding the rides this morning. What were your top three? Wow wow I love that question. My top one was the the wheels that spin around where you get inside a tire and then they kind of spin you on a rope. Yeah they take you on a rope, they spin you a tie, you go downhill in attire. You're fighting huh? That's the name of that ride. It's called. I'm stuck in a car and they roll you down a hill full speed while you're in a tire, your heads banging against the ground constantly and they roll you straight into the river. Yeah, and you get points if you get hurt. Alright, well I did ask for three rides, so can you name two more and remember they can be literally anything. Absolutely yeah. My other one was that roller coaster that was made out of old cars. Oh yeah, the roller coaster made of old cars is fantastic. It's a bunch of Model T cars and they're just recuiting upon endless wooden hill. Tina, what did you think of that? Well, I actually I loved it too, but then we were told later it wasn't a ride and we were being taken. Man alive, I'd hate all those rides. Me too that's it for us today. But before we go a special round of applause for this week. Loser Raphael chestang. Thanks, that makes me feel better. Thank you for being with us. And playing next on YouTube *********** for dogs but written by cats."

Text with Sam: (310) 496-8371","From West Hollywood, CA, the only news team that doesn't know what's on the teleprompter before they read it. Anyone who laughs or breaks loses points. This is breaking news. Welcome to breaking news the show where we don't know what we're about to say, and we're not allowed to smile or laugh. I'm glumbo dumb person and my name is our top story tonight. Hot dogs today. The FDA announced that hot dogs are made of human flesh, according to the FBI. We just inspected hot dogs and it turns out they're made of people. They've been people this whole time. It should have been obvious that hot dogs aren't beef because hamburgers are beef and hamburgers are brown, hot dogs are red, red is a different color than brown. Red is the color of human flesh, but don't worry. The FDA said the hot dogs are still totally safe and you should keep eating them. Hot dogs are delicious and they're super cheap. If you enjoyed hot dogs before you before you knew they were made of human corpses, it would be silly to stop eating. Now meat is meet the FDA, say where the dead people and hot dogs come from. Yes, apparently, apparently the hotdog industry and the graveyard industry have been conspiring together. All the coffins buried in graveyards are empty and the dead bodies are sent to the hot dog factory. Interesting turning to our next story. Check your house to see if you own any ****** because. A massive product recall has just been declared for millions of ****** nationwide. Our chief ***** correspondent Hotch Doodles is live outside the headquarters of ***** Tech Incorporated. The company that issued the recall, thanks ****** were created to help him manatee but these ****** are the exact opposite. It's shocking to think that so many people have been hurt so many lives shattered all by something as innocent as a ***** but we're told the ****** were pretty good at being ******. They worked great at doing the sexy stuff. Yes, the dodos did do a good job at their intended. Purpose of poking people in their sins owns nobody. Got injured in their **** or in their groin. That was fine. The deals are bad because of unrelated problems. Had nothing to do with sex. I have a list of all the demands of being taken off shelves when I say the product name. Can you tell me a nonsexual reason? It was recalled, OK, but remember the site despite being PG 13 rated. These ***** Palmers, still very horrific. I warn everyone when you hear these ***** problems. You will probably stream and puke and puke and scream. And puke and puke and scream and puke and puke and scream and scream and puke and scream alright here are the ***** names. First step is the Dodgers preference. What was wrong with it? Well the queen blessed it and therefore it could only work on the queen herself. So the Queen Blessed Boston Jamboree. Well that was just a racist *****. Interesting makes sense. The Eviscerator well, surprisingly it's a misnomer. The Eviscerator actually was too soft for sexual pleasure. Now that's a sexual reason. The non sexual reason is that it was made of lead. No, I only eviscerator. It's my favorite *****. OK, well then you should probably get your regions. Check for lead poisoning. And finally, the Gary Sinise official license *****. Oh, this is the worst one yet. It it only yells Lieutenant Dan Lines when you're using it, so you don't want that being yelled into your **** or whatever other regions that you would use. The other regions you know, a potential vagina, a potential. Yes. And so on your ears. I don't know. Everyone in America is praying that ****** never mess up like this again, thanks for that story. Hunch back to you. Now we turn to finance reporter Mr Money who is at Wall Street with the latest info about stock market stuff. Hello, I'm good tidings. I am Mr money and I will share my money secrets with you stocks and bonds. That's what we're here for. Lay it on us baby joy, joy, joy, joy. I am pleased to say stock market is up economy as big. Oh so big huge economy. Economy is big and swollen like a large blister. Soon Blister will pop in the inside of the blister. The blister, deuces money, I mean the numbers. Oh these numbers are wow. Wow wow. The stock market numbers today are so good. Guess what? We're all rich now. We're all rich now. Now that I am rich, I'm going to divorce my children and send him to the orphanage. I am going to spend millions of dollars to hunt a lion and then I'll post with the lion's dead body and post a photo online. So everyone on the Internet will hate me and docs my address and then I'll get death threats mailed to my house, which is what I want Mr. Money. Now that you're rich, what will you do with all your money? Oh, I have big plans for my money. Here are the 10 luxurious things I plan to do with my Wall Street fortune #1 buy a house number 2. Furniture for the house number 3. Cool wallpaper for the house number for Phillip. Everybody on my blocks gas tank charity work if you will number five more food, just a lot of food. #6 some sort of clothing. You know, #7. Oh my God. Like a garden for the house, just one number, just one and then eight little some sort of vegetable salad. And then I thought you already had food and then number bought food and you have a garden, yes? And then I have a vegetable salad. Number 9 and extra garage and then number 10. Just you know, trip. Nothing for your coworkers or anything. Nope, wonderful. Those are great plans. Oh no, no terrible news. The numbers, the numbers are down. The stock market is destroyed, the economy is over. We're all poor now. Oh well, the economy was good while it lasted. And that's also the end of our show for breaking news. I'm glumbo dumb person. And before we go we have one last announcement this week. Loser who just couldn't hold it together, is meek. Alan Schneider hurray. I thought your name was glumbo Yep. Thanks for watching. That's my line you soulless worm. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching God. Thanks for watching. I will say it. Thanks for watching."

Doctor Magine, but yes, football did exist before sloth and play slot and signed a pro contract with Malmo in 1996 whilst at Malmo Arson. Vengar tried to persuade Slaton to take a trial for Arsenal, but he should have known slatton does not do auditions.

She keeps me fed and lets me sleep. She's also hotter than any woman who's ever looked at you when slid down. Sign for you very. It was the biggest thing to hit Italy since the Roman Empire at UVA sled than one steady out twice, which is more than any Roman emperor ever managed. They then took the titles away because of a bribery scandal, so Slaton moved to Inter in 2006. Slaton supported Interesa Boy now enter, supported slap that in the first season. Zlatan won the Scudetto with a record 97 points. Naturally let Dan was top scorer and unknown coach called Jose Marino made his reputation, managing Slaton at Inter Sletten would have died for him. He was a good coach but when slept & for Barcelona in 2009. Let them had a jealous little man called wide violas coach. 60,000 came to the camp new for sletten's unveiling. That's more people and came to watch The Beatles at Shea Stadium. It's more people than came to the fall of the Berlin Wall and it's a lot more people than came to the Last Supper. Gladiola was jealous so slight that move to PSG, whence let that won the league and finished top scorer naturally. The Eiffel Tower was no longer the biggest thing in Paris.

Millions of people around the world live with depression. Many of these individuals and their families are afraid to talk about their struggles, and don't know where to turn for help. However, depression is largely preventable and treatable. Recognizing depression and seeking help is the first and most critical towards recovery. 

In collaboration with WHO to mark World Mental Health Day, writer and illustrator Matthew Johnstone tells the story of overcoming the ""black dog of depression"". More information on the book can be found here: http://matthewjohnstone.com.au/

Whenever the Black Dog made an appearance, I thought empty and life just seemed to slow down. He would surprise me with a visit for no reason or occasion. The Black dog made me look and feel older than my ears. When the rest of the world seem to be enjoying life, I could only see it through the black dog. Activities that usually brought me pleasure. Suddenly ceased to. He liked to ruin my appetite. He chewed up my memory and my ability to concentrate. Doing anything or going anywhere with the black dog required superhuman strength. At social occasions he'd sniff out what confidence I had and chase it away. My biggest fear was being found out. I worried that people would judge me because of the shame and stigma of the Black dog. I was constantly worried that I'd be found out, so I invested vast amounts of energy into covering EM up, keeping up an emotional life is exhausting. Black Dog could make me think and say negative things. He could make me irritable and difficult to be around. He would take my love and bury mine to the sea. He loved nothing more than to wake me up with highly repetitive and negative thinking. He also liked to remind me how exhausted I was going to be the next day. Having a black dog in your life isn't so much about feeling a bit down sad or blue. At its worst, it's about being devoid of feeling altogether. As I got older, the black dog got bigger and he started hanging around all the time. I chase them off with whatever I thought might send him running. But more often than not, he'd come out on top. Going down became easier and getting up again, so I became rather good at self medication. Which never really helped. Eventually I felt totally isolated from everything and everyone. The Black Dog had finally succeeded in hijacking my life. When you lose all joy in life, you can begin to question what the point of it is. Thankfully, this was the time that I saw a professional help. This is my first step towards recovery and a major turning point in my life. I learned that it doesn't matter who you are. The black dog effects millions and millions of people. It is an equal opportunity mungal. I also learned that there was no silver bullet or magic pill medication can help some and others might need a different approach altogether. I also learned that being emotionally genuine and authentic to those who are close to you can be an absolute game changer. Most importantly, I learned not to be afraid of the Black Dog, and I taught him a few new tricks on my own. The more tired and stressed you are, the louder he barks. So it's important to learn how to quiet your mind. It's been clinically proven that regular exercise can be as effective for treating mild moderate depression as antidepressants, so go for a walk or a run and leave them up behind. Keep a mood journal. Getting your thoughts on paper can be cathartic and often insightful. Also, keep track of the things that you have to be grateful for. The most important thing to remember is that no matter how bad it gets, if you take the right steps, talk to the right people. Black Dog days can and will pass. I wouldn't say that I'm grateful for the black dog. But he's been an incredible teacher. He forced me to re evaluate and simplify my life. I learned that rather than running away from my problems, it's better to embrace them. The Black dog may always be part of my life that he'll never be the beast that he was. We have an understanding I've learned through knowledge, patience, discipline, and humor. The worst black dog can be made to heal if you're in difficulty. Never be afraid to ask for help. There is absolutely no shame in doing so. The only shame. Is missing out on life."

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans (SARS-CoV-2). To find out more, watch this short video which was revised on 15 June 2020 to reflect the evolving context. 

Further resources are available online:

Learn about OpenWHO, WHO’s interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies here: https://openwho.org/","In December 2019, there was a cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan in China. Some of the early cases had reported visiting or working in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan. Investigations found that the disease was caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The disease was subsequently named COVID-19 COVID-19 spread within China and to the rest of the world on 30 January 2020. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. In this video, we'll take a quick look at what is currently known about COVID-19. Keep in mind that this is a new disease and what's known is rapidly evolving and might change in the future. So what is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses. They consist of a core of genetic material surrounded by a lipid envelope with protein spikes. This gives it the appearance of a crown. Crown in Latin is called Corona, and that's how these viruses get their name. There are different types of corona viruses that cause illness in animals and humans in humans. Coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. These include the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first identified in China in 2003, the Middle East, respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and SARS Co V2. The name of the virus that causes COVID-19 that was first reported in December 2019. So where did this new virus come from? It's known that coronaviruses circulate in a range of animals. Sometimes these viruses can make the jump from animals to humans. This is called a spillover and could be due to a range of factors such as mutations in the virus or increased contact between humans and animals. For example, MERS Co V is known to be transmitted from camels and SARS, Co V from civet cats, the animal reservoir of the new coronavirus is not known yet. How does the disease spread? The disease can spread from person to person through droplets. When an infected person releases those droplets through coughing, talking or sneezing. For example, when close to another person, it can also spread. When infected droplets land on objects, and when another person touches them and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. What are the symptoms? The incubation period, which is the time taken from exposure to the virus and development of symptoms, is on average five to six days, but can range from 1 to 14 days. There can be a range of symptoms from very mild to severe. Some people may not develop symptoms. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath. Some people reported loss of their sense of taste or smell, and some may develop a skin rash. In more severe cases, there could be pneumonia, organ failure and sometimes death. About 80% of cases recover from the disease without needing special treatment, but there are some people who are at risk of serious illness. They include older people or people with underlying medical problems such as chronic respiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or cancer. How can we tell whether someone is infected? The infection is commonly diagnosed by a test called reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, generally known as PCR. This test identifies the virus based on its genetic fingerprint. There's also a blood test that can check for antibodies against the virus, which may show that someone was infected in the past. How is it treated? The treatment for COVID-19 is mainly supportive care medicines against the virus are currently under investigation. How do we prevent transmission of the virus? There are a number of effective ways to prevent the spread of the disease. These include covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing with a flexed elbow or tissue, and throwing the tissue in a closed bin immediately after use. Wash hands regularly with soap and water or an alcohol based hand rub, maintaining at least 1 meter distance from people and the appropriate use of masks and personal protective equipment, especially in health settings. It's important to stay home if you're feeling unwell and to call a hotline or your medical professional. But if you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early and share your travel history or contact with someone unwell with your health care provider. In some areas, governments have implemented specific physical and social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the outbreak. It's important to follow their advice. Vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are currently under development, and scientists around the world are working hard to make this happen. That's a quick look at this emerging infectious disease. We're still learning about this virus every day, and what's known may change, so please check the website below for the most up-to-date information."

However, it must be used correctly and always combined with other measures to protect yourself and everyone else. Here is how to wear a fabric mask safely.
 For more information, visit: www.who.int","A fabric mask acts as a barrier to prevent the spread of the virus. It must be used correctly and always combined with other measures to protect yourself and everyone else. When wearing a fabric mask, clean your hands before putting it on. Inspect the mask and do not use it if it is damaged or dirty. Cover your mouth, nose and chin. Adjust the mask to your face, leaving no gaps on the sides. Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. Change your mask once it gets dirty or wet. To take off the mask, clean your hands first. Remove it by the straps behind the head or ears without touching the front of the mask. As you remove the mask, pull it away from your face. Clean your hands after taking off any mask. If you need to reuse a fabric mask, store it in a clean, resealable bag. Hold the mask the elastic ends when removing it from the bag and make sure it is not dirty or wet before using it again. Wash fabric masks and soap or detergent, preferably with hot water at least once a day. Make sure you have your own mask and do not share it with others. When wearing a mask, make sure you know how to put it on. Use it, remove it and discard it, or wash it correctly. Remember that a mask alone cannot protect you when wearing a mask. Continue to adopt other measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Stay at least one metre away from others. Clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your face and mask. Stay safe and let's all prevent the spread of COVID-19."

--

Sometimes, against a uniform, bright background such as a clear sky or a blank computer screen, you might see things floating across your field of vision. What are these moving objects, and how are you seeing them? Michael Mauser explains the visual phenomenon that is floaters.

It may look like a tiny worm or a transparent blob. And whenever you try to get a closer look, it disappears, only to reappear as soon as you shift your glance. But don't go rinsing out your eyes. What you are seeing is a common phenomenon known as a floater. The scientific name for these objects is Muscoy Valley Tantis Latin for flying flies and true to their name. They can be somewhat annoying, but they're not actually bugs or any kind of external objects at all. Rather, they exist inside your eyeball. Floaters may seem to be alive since they move and change shape, but they are not alive. Floaters are tiny objects that cast shadows on the retina. The light sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. They might be bits of tissue, red blood cells, or clumps of protein. And because they're suspended within the vitreous humour, the gel like liquid that fills the inside of your eye floaters drift along with your eye movements and seem to bounce a little when your eye stops. Floaters may be only barely distinguishable most of the time. They become more visible the closer they are to their retina, just as holding your hand closer to a table with an overhead light will result in a more sharply defined shadow. And floaters are particularly noticeable when you are looking at a uniform bright surface like a blank computer screen snow or a clear sky where the consistency of the background makes them easier to distinguish. The brighter the light is, the more your pupil contracts. This has an effect similar to replacing a large diffuse light fixture with a single overhead light bulb, which also makes the shadow appear clearer. There is another visual phenomenon that looks similar to floaters, but is in fact unrelated. If you've seen tiny dots of light darting about when looking at a bright blue sky, you've experienced what is known as the Bluefield Entoptic phenomenon. In some ways, this is the opposite of seeing floaters. Here you are not seeing shadows but little moving windows, letting light through to your retina. The windows are actually caused by white blood cells moving through the Kappel Aries along your retina surface. These leukocytes can be so large that they nearly fill a capillary, causing a plasma space to open up in front of them. Because the space and the white blood cells are both more transparent to blue light than the red blood cells normally present in Kappel Aries, we see a moving dot of light wherever this happens following the pads of your Kappel Aries and moving in time with your pulse. Under ideal viewing conditions, you might even see what looks like a dark tail following the dot. This is the red blood cells that have bunched up behind the leukocyte. Some science museums have an exhibit which consists of a screen of blue light, allowing you to see these blue sky sprites much more clearly than you normally would. While everybody's eye is experienced, these sort of effects the number and type vary greatly. In the case of floaters, they often go unnoticed as our brain learns to ignore them. However, abnormally numerous or large floaters that interfere with vision may be a sign of a more serious condition requiring immediate medical treatment, but the majority of the time entoptic phenomena such as floaters and blue sky sprites are just a gentle reminder that what we think we see depends just as much on our biology in minds as it does on the external world."

A handful of species on Earth share a seemingly mysterious trait: a menstrual cycle. We’re one of the select few mammals on Earth that menstruate, and we also do it more than any other animal, even though it’s a waste of nutrients, and can be a physical inconvenience. So where’s the sense in this uncommon biological process? TED-Ed describes the history and evolution of menstruation. 

Lesson by TED-Ed, animation by TED-Ed.","A handful of species on Earth, they share a seemingly mysterious trait, a menstrual cycle. We're one of the select few monkeys, apes, bats, humans and possibly elephant shrews are the only mammals on earth that menstruate. We also do it more than any other animal, even though it's a waste of nutrients and can be a physical inconvenience. So where's the sense in this uncommon biological process? The answer begins with pregnancy. During this process the body's resources are cleverly used to shape a suitable environment for a fetus, creating an internal haven for a mother to nurture her growing child. In this respect, pregnancy is awe inspiring, but that's only half the story. The other half reveals that pregnancy places a mother and her child at odds. As for all living creatures, the human body evolved to promote the spread of its genes for the mother, that means she should try to provide equally for all her offspring. But a mother and her fetus don't share exactly the same genes the fetus inherits genes from its father as well, and those genes can promote their own survival by extracting more than their fair share of resources from the mother. This evolutionary conflict of interests places a woman and her unborn child in a biological tug of war that plays out inside the womb. One factor contributing to this internal tussle is the placenta. The fetal organ that connects to the mother's blood supply and nourishes the fetus while it grows. In most mammals, the placenta is confined behind a barrier of maternal cells. This barrier lets the mother control the supply of nutrients to the fetus, but in humans and a few other species, the placenta actually penetrates right into the mother circulatory system to directly access her bloodstream. Through its placenta, the fetus pumps the mothers arteries with hormones that keep them open to provide a permanent flow of nutrient rich blood. A fetus with such unrestricted access can manufacture hormones to increase the mother's blood, sugar, dilate her arteries, and inflate her blood pressure. Most mammal mothers can expel or reabsorb embryos if required, but in humans, once the fetus is connected to the blood supply, severing that connection can result in hemorrhage. If the fetus develops poorly or dies, the mother's health is endangered. As it grows, a fetus is ongoing. Need for resources can cause intense fatigue, high blood pressure and conditions like diabetes and preeclampsia. Because of these risks, pregnancy is always a huge and sometimes dangerous investment. So it makes sense that the body should screen embryos carefully to find out which ones are worth the challenge. This is where menstruation fits in. Pregnancy starts with a process called implantation, where the embryo embeds itself in the endometrium that lines the uterus. The endometrium evolved to make implantation difficult so that only the healthy embryos could survive. But in doing so, it also selected for the most vigorously invasive embryos, creating an evolutionary feedback loop. The embryo engages in a complex, exquisitely timed hormonal dialogue that transforms the endometrium to allow implantation. What happens when an embryo fails the test? It might still manage to attach or even get partly through the endometrium. As it slowly dies, it could leave its mother vulnerable to infection. And all the time it may be emitting hormonal signals that disrupt her tissues. The body avoids this problem by simply removing every possible risk each time. A violation doesn't result in a healthy pregnancy. The womb gets rid of its endometrial lining along with any unfertilized eggs, sick, dying, or dead embryos. That protective process is known as menstruation, leading to the period. This biological trait, bizarre as it may be, sets us on course for the continuation of the human race."

It's in paradise. Wait, what's this? In fact, Malicia is a type of yeast that lives and dines on all of our scalps and in about half of the human population. Its activity. Causes dandruff, so why do some people have more dandruff than others? And how can it be treated? We might consider ourselves individuals, but we're really colonies. Our skin hosts billions of microbes, malassezia yeasts make themselves at home on our skin shortly after we're born follicles. The tiny cavities that grow hairs all over our body make for especially popular living quarters. Malassezia are fond of these hideouts because they contain glands that secrete an oil called sebum that's thought. To lubricate and strengthen our hair. Malassezia evolved to consume our skins, proteins and oils, and because of its many sebum secreting follicles, our scalp is one of the oiliest places on our body and consequently one of the yeasty is. As these fungi feast on our scalp oils, dandruff may form. This is because sebum is composed of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, saturated fats neatly packed together unsaturated fats. On the other hand, contain double bonds that create an irregular kink in their structure. Malassezia eat sebum by secreting an enzyme that releases all of the oils fatty acids, but they only consume the saturated fats, leaving the unsaturated ones behind. These irregularly shaped leftovers soak into the skin and pry its barrier open, allowing water to escape. The body detects these breaches and responds defensively causing the inflammation that gives dandruff its itch. It also makes the skin cells proliferate to repair the damaged barrier. Usually our skin's outer surface or epidermis completely renews itself every two to three weeks. Epidermal cells divide, move outwards, die and form the skins. Tough outer layer which gradually sheds off in single cells far too small to see. But with dandruff cells churn out quickly to correct the broken barrier, meaning they don't mature and differentiate properly. Instead they form large greasy clumps around the hair follicle. That are shed as visible flakes. This is how malassezia is voracious appetite and our bodies reaction to its by products lead to dandruff. Currently the most effective way to get rid of dandruff is by using antifungals in things like shampoos applied directly to the scalp to kill malassezia. For those who experience STENDRA it usually comes and goes as sebum secretions vary throughout one's lifetime due to hormonal changes. But despite the fact that. Malicia colonized everyone to a similar extent. Not everyone gets dandruff. Some people are more susceptible. Exactly why is unclear. Do people with dandruff have a certain genetic predisposition? Is their skin barrier more permeable? Scientists are currently investigating. If people with dandruff do in fact lose more water through their scalps, and whether this is what's leading their skin cells to proliferate. Researchers are learning that malassezia communicate with our immune system using small oily molecules called oxylipins that regulate inflammation. If they can find a way to inhibit inflammatory oxylipins and boost anti inflammatory ones, they could develop new treatments. Scientists are also investigating if there's any benefit to our relationship with malassezia. They hypothesize that dandruff, which can be uncomfortable and embarrassing for us, creates a reliable oily food source for the yeast. But dandruff isn't contagious or a great threat to our health, and malassezia seem to excel at defending their territory. Our skin from other, more harmful microbes like Staphylococcus orixas. So while scientists have gotten to the bottom of many mysteries surrounding this condition, it must be said dandruff remains a head scratcher. Dandruff isn't the only unpleasant condition that microbes and our bodies conspire to create. If you could eradicate body odor or bad breath, which would you choose?

Approximately seven million people around the world die from heart attacks every year. And cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other problems like strokes, is the world’s leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Krishna Sudhir examines the leading causes and treatments of this deadly disease.

Lesson by Krishna Sudhir, animation by Chadwick Whitehead.","Approximately 7,000,000 people around the world die from heart attacks every year and cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other problems like strokes, is the world's leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen and during a heart attack it can't get enough fatty deposits or plaques. Develop on the walls of our coronary arteries. Those are the vessels that supply oxygenated blood to the heart. These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky pardoned or inflamed. Eventually, the plaques can turn into blockages if one of the plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it in minutes, and a partially closed artery can become completely blocked. Blood flow is cut off to the cardiac muscle, and the oxygen starved cells. Start to die within several minutes. This is a myocardial infarction or heart attack. Things can rapidly deteriorate in the absence of treatment. The injured muscle may not be able to pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown off in the worst case scenario, a heart attack can cause sudden death. And how do you know that someone is having a heart attack? The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen deprived heart. Muscle patients describe it as crushing or vice like it can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen. But it's not always as sudden and dramatic as it is in the movies. Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath. Symptoms may be less prominent in women and the elderly. For them, weakness and tiredness may be the main signal, and surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes, which affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent. If you think that someone might be having a heart attack, the most important thing is to respond quickly if you have. Access to emergency medical services. Call them. They're the fastest way to get to a hospital taking aspirin, which thins the blood and nitroglycerin which opens up the artery can help keep the heart attack from getting worse in the emergency room, doctors can diagnose a heart attack. They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's electrical activity and a blood test to assess heart muscle damage. The patient is then taken to a high tech cardiac suite where tests are done. To locate the blockages. Cardiologists can reopen the blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon in a procedure called an angioplasty. Frequently, they also insert a metal or polymer stent that will hold the artery open. More extensive blockages might require coronary artery bypass surgery using a piece of vein or artery from another part of the body. Heart surgeons can reroute blood flow around the blockage. These procedures reestablish circulation to the cardiac muscle restoring heart function. Heart attack treatment is advancing, but prevention is vital. Genetics and lifestyle factors both affect your risk and the good news is that you can change your lifestyle, exercise a healthy diet and weight loss, all lower the risk of heart attacks. Whether you've had one before or not. Doctors recommend exercising a few times a week, doing both aerobic activity and strength, training a heart healthy diet is low in sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease. So what should you eat? Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains and nuts like walnuts and almonds all seem to be beneficial. A good diet and exercise plan can also keep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower your heart attack risk as well. And of course, medications can also help prevent heart attacks. Doctors often prescribe low dose aspirin for example, particularly for patients who've already had a heart attack, and for those known to be at. High risk and drugs that help manage risk factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes will Make Heart attacks less likely to heart. Attacks may be common, but they don't have to be inevitable. A healthy diet avoiding tobacco use, staying fit and enjoying plenty of sleep and lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure your body is most important. Muscle keeps on beating."

A swing without gravity soars to a terrifying height. The outlines of people and things dissolve countless poets and writers have tried to put words to the experience of a panic attack, a sensation so overwhelming. Many people mistake it for a heart attack, stroke or other life threatening crisis. Though panic attacks don't cause long term physical harm afterwards, the fear of another attack can limit someone's daily life and cause more panic attacks. Studies suggest that almost a third of us will experience at least one panic attack in our lives, and whether it's your first, your 100th, or you're witnessing someone else go through one, no one wants to repeat the experience. Even learning about them can be uncomfortable, but it's necessary because the first step to preventing panic attacks is understanding them. At its core, a panic attack is an overreaction to the body's normal physiological response to the perception of danger. This response starts with the amygdala, the brain region involved in processing fear. When the amygdala perceives danger, it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline prompts an increase in the heart and breathing rate to get blood and oxygen to the muscles of the arms and legs. This also sends oxygen to the brain, making it more. Alert and responsive during a panic attack. This response is exaggerated. Well past what would be useful in a dangerous situation causing a racing heart, heavy breathing or hyperventilation. The changes to blood flow caused Lightheadedness and numbness in the hands and feet. A panic attack usually peaks within 10 minutes. Then the prefrontal cortex takes over from the amygdala and stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system. This triggers the release of a hormone called acetylcholine that decreases the heart rate and gradually winds down the panic attack. In a panic attack, the body's perception of danger is enough to trigger the response. We would have to a real threat and then some. We don't know for sure why this happens, but sometimes cues in the environment that remind us of traumatic past experience can trigger a panic attack. Panic attacks can be part of anxiety disorders like PTSD, social anxiety disorder, OCD, and generalized anxiety disorder, recurring panic attacks, frequent worry about new attacks, and behavioral changes. To avoid panic attacks can lead to a diagnosis of a panic disorder. The two main treatments for panic disorder are antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. Both have about a 40% response rate, though someone who responds to one may not respond to the other. However, antidepressant medications carry some side effects, and 50% of people relapse when they stop taking them. CBT, meanwhile, is more lasting, with only a 20% relapse rate. The goal of CBT treatment for panic disorder is to help people learn and practice concrete tools to exert physical and in turn, mental control. Over the sensations and thoughts associated with a panic attack, CBT begins with an explanation of the physiological causes of a panic attack followed by breath and muscle exercises designed to help people consciously control breathing patterns. Next comes cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying and changing the thoughts that are common during attacks, such as believing you'll stop breathing, have a heart attack or die, and replacing them with more accurate thoughts. The next stage of treatment is exposure to the bodily sensations and situations that typically trigger a panic attack. The goal is to change the belief through experience that these sensations and situations are dangerous. Even after CBT, taking these steps isn't easy in the grip of an attack, but with practice these tools can both prevent and deescalate attacks and ultimately reduce the hold of panic on a person's life. Outside formal therapy, many panickers find relief from the same beliefs. CBT aims to instill that fear can't hurt you, but holding onto it will escalate panic, even if you've never had a panic attack, understanding them will help you identify one in yourself or someone else, and recognizing them is the first step in preventing them. Panic attacks can be a common symptom for those suffering from mental health disorders like PTSD and OCD. So what causes PTSD and what does it mean to have OCD? Educate yourself with these videos."

But what started out as a celebration led to a health crisis. Just a few days after the pilgrimage, more than 2000 cases of meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world. The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a wave of deadly meningitis epidemics that ultimately infected 10s of thousands of people worldwide. Meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges. 3 tissue layers responsible for protecting the brain and spinal cord. What makes meningitis so dangerous compared to other diseases is the sheer speed with which it invades a person's body. In the worst cases, it causes death within a day. Fortunately, that's rare for patients who receive early medical treatment. The disease primarily comes in three forms, fungal, viral, and bacterial, the last being the most deadly by far, and what we'll focus on. People usually contract bacterial meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and saliva that spray into the air. When an infected person sneezes or coughs. It can also be transmitted through kissing or sharing cigarettes, toothbrushes, or utensils. Some people can be infected and carry the disease without showing symptoms or getting sick, which helps the disease spread quickly to others. Once the bacteria enter the nose, mouth and throat, they cross the surrounding membranes and enter the bloodstream from there, bacteria have rapid access to the body's tissues, including a membrane called the blood brain barrier. This is made of a tight mesh of cells which separate blood vessels from the brain and block everything except for a specific set of particles, including water molecules and some gases. But in ways that scientists are still trying to understand. Meningitis bacteria can trick the barrier into letting them through. Inside the brain the bacteria swiftly infect the meninges. This triggers inflammation as the body's immune response kicks into OverDrive, bringing on fever and intense headaches. As swelling in the meninges worsens, the neck begins to stiffen. Swelling in the brain disrupts its normal function, causing symptoms like hearing loss and extreme light sensitivity. As pressure increases in the cranium, it may also make the person confused one of the hallmarks of the disease. A few hours in the rapidly multiplying bacteria start to release toxins leading to septicemia, also known as blood poisoning. This breaks down blood vessels, letting blood seep out and form what starts out, looking like a rash and evolves into big discolored blots beneath the skin. At the same time, those toxins burn through oxygen in the blood, reducing the amount that gets to major organs like the lungs and kidneys that increases. The chance of organ shutdown and alongside spreading septicemia, threatens death. That all sounds scary, but doctors are so good at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can drastically reduce and adults risk of dying from it. The longer it's left untreated though, the more likely it will lead to lasting damage. If declining oxygen levels cause cell death in extreme parts of the body, like fingers, toes, arms and legs, the risk of amputation goes up and if bacterial toxins accumulate in the brain and trigger cell death, meningitis could also cause. Long term brain damage and memory loss. So fast treatment or better yet, prevention is critical. That's why most countries have vaccines that defend against the disease in its deadliest forms. Those are usually given to the people who are most at risk. Like young children, people with weak immune systems, or people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis could potentially happen. In addition to those gatherings, meningitis is most common in a region called the meningitis belt. That stretches across Africa, though cases do happen all over the world. If you're concerned that you or someone you know may have meningitis, get to the doctor as soon as possible. Quick action could save your life.

Can you grow a human bone outside the human body? The answer may soon be yes. Nina Tandon explores the possibility by examining how bones naturally grow inside the body, and illuminating how scientists are hoping to replicate that process in a lab.

Lesson by Nina Tandon, animation by Giant Animation Studios.","Can you grow a human bone outside the human body? The answer may soon be yes, but before we can understand how that's possible, we need to look at how bones grow naturally inside the body. Most bones start in a growing fetus as a soft, flexible cartilage bone, forming cells replace the cartilage with a spongy mineral lattice made of elements like calcium and phosphate. This lattice gets harder as osteoblasts, which are specialized bone forming cells deposit more mineral giving bones their strength. While the lattice itself is not made of living cells, networks of blood vessels, nerves, and other living tissues grow through special channels and passages and over the course of development, a legion of osteoblasts reinforce the skeleton that protects our organs, allows us to move, produces blood cells and more. But this initial building process alone is not enough to make bones strong and functional. If you took a bone built this way, attached muscles to it and tried to use it to lift a heavyweight, the bone would probably snap under the strain. This doesn't usually happen to us because our cells are constantly reinforcing and building bone wherever they're used. A principle we refer to as wolfs law. However, bone materials are a limited resource and this new reinforcing bone can be formed only if there is enough material present. Fortunately, osteoblasts. The builders have a counterpart called Osteoclast's. The recyclers. Osteoclasts breakdown the unneeded mineral lattice using acids and enzymes so that osteoblasts can then add more material. One of the main reasons astronauts must exercise constantly in orbit is due to the lack of skeletal strain in freefall. As projected by Wolff's law, that makes Osteoclast's more active than osteoblasts, resulting in a loss of bone mass and strength. When bones do break, your body has an amazing ability to reconstruct the injured bone, as if the break had never happened. Certain situations like cancer removal, traumatic accidents, and genetic defects exceed the body's natural ability for repair. Historical solutions have included filling in the resulting holes with metal animal bones or pieces of bone from human donors, but none of these are optimal as they can cause infections or be rejected by the immune system and they can't carry out most of the functions of healthy bones. An ideal solution would be to grow a bone made from the patient's own cells that's customized to the exact shape of the hull, and that's exactly what scientists are currently trying to do. Here's how it works. First, doctors extract stem cells from a patient fat tissue and take CT scans to determine the exact dimensions of the missing bone. They then model the exact shape of the hull, either with 3D printers or by carving decellularized cow bones. Those are the bones where all of the cells have been stripped away, leaving only the sponge like mineral lattice. They then add the patient stem cells to this lattice and place it in a bioreactor, a device that will simulate all of the conditions found inside the body. Temperature, humidity, acidity, and nutrient composition all need to be just right for the stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts and other cells colonize the mineral lattice and remodel it with living tissue. But there's one thing missing, remember, will flaw in artificial bone needs to experience real stress or else it will come out weak and brittle so the bioreactor constantly pumps fluids around the bone and the pressure tells the osteoblasts to add bone density. Put all of this together and within three weeks the now living bone is ready to come out of the bioreactor and to be implanted into the patient's body. While it isn't yet certain that this method will work for humans, lab grown bones have already been successfully implanted in pigs and other animals, and human trials may begin as early as 2016."

Many individuals with aspergers disorder actually have precocious language early in their lives, so they begin using words even before we would expect people who are typically developing to use language, and they'll use big words to adult like language, and that's one reason why when young kids who are go on to be diagnosed with aspergers when they're younger, it's hard for people to tell. Sometimes because adults love talking to kids with aspergers disorder. Because they say such interesting things, almost adult like things. But in this tiny little body of a child. And so it's fascinating for the adults to talk with them and kids with Aspergers. Like to talk to adults as well where they really struggled though is with peers. And that's oftentimes how people with Aspergers are identified, because peers are not like talking to adults, peers are much more attuned to unusual parts of behavioral. So for example, if you're not appropriately attending to them in terms of your eye contact appear is going to notice. An adult's going to Slough it off and say that they're a kid. And so individuals to aspergers disorder end up being very high functioning. They can be brilliant, so sometimes they have Iqs they're extremely high. They oftentimes will have pockets of knowledge or ability that is quite exceptional. That also makes it hard for parents to notice because they just think that they have an exceptional child and there are some exceptional people that have weaker social abilities, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they have aspergers disorder. Aspergers disorder is very specifically a clear social communication impairment where you have trouble with social awareness, you have trouble perceiving other people's intentions and motivations. You're not quite sure why. Other people are acting a certain way and you have difficulty acting on that. So you don't know exactly how to behave in a complex social environment. People with Aspergers when they're younger especially have trouble interpreting Nonliteral language, and we all use non literal language all the time. So we'll be sarcastic for example, or we'll use phrases like don't sweat the small stuff and people with aspergers disorder. In fact, one of my patients with aspergers disorder when you say don't sweat the small stuff, their interpretation is that you shouldn't use the big exercise equipment because it'll make you sweat more, so they tend to be quite concrete in their interpretation of that non literal language. But people with aspergers disorder can be quite talented and have abilities, and that's what makes that part of the spectrum really the hardest to diagnose earlier in life."

It affects 1.3 million people, and it's more common in women. Here are five warning signs to lookout for the pain that can happen, and rheumatoid arthritis can affect multiple joints in the body, so most patients with rheumatoid arthritis will have pain in their hands and wrists, and that's usually symmetric, so it'll affect both hands and both wrists. But it can affect other joints of the body to other commonly involved areas are the knees, the ankles, the feet, the hips, elbows, shoulder and neck. Stiffness is frequently worse in the morning and patients will describe waking up and needing extra time to get ready for their day, and the stiffness can last from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours. Usually that stiffness will get better with. Moving around and and getting going. Sometimes a hot shower will help with stiffness and it can be an overall sense of stiffness. Or it can be localized to the hands or wrists. Swelling can be seen in the hands and the wrists and the joints can really become enlarged and fluid can be present in the joint space itself. You can also see fluid in the knees and the ankles. You can have swelling in the. Fee as well the fatigue that some patients with rheumatoid arthritis can experience can really be overwhelming and may be the reason that they wind up going to a physician. It can last all day. They can sometimes have difficulty sleeping, or sometimes they need feel the need to sleep all the time. Loss of function can occur for several different reasons. It can occur secondary to the pain or stiffness in the joints or because of fatigue. Patients may not exercise or do their usual activities. Rheumatoid arthritis, if untreated, can lead to damage in the joints and that damage that occurs in the joints can lead to loss of function overtime. When patients experience these different symptoms, they really should be seen by their physician and referred to a rheumatologist. Those symptoms that we listed for rheumatoid arthritis are not only seen in rheumatoid arthritis. But in other conditions and as well, and a rheumatologist would be in a good position to help make that diagnosis with everyday health. I'm Karen Brill."

The cause. So let's say it's the common *******: Then time should settle that down. If the spasms occur frequently, and if they're really worrisome in terms of causing urgency and having to get to the bowel movement to the toilet and the big hurry. Then an antispasmodic might be good for that patient. If the diarrhea is infectious. Then an antibiotic might be given as well as fluids, either hourly or intravenously. But it's a mistake in a patient with infectious diarrhea to try and shut down the diarrhea by giving an anti diarrheal. Because the diarrhea when there's a non fiction. Maybe the body's way of getting rid of that infectious agent. And if you block it up. Then the infection might get worse. If the diarrhea. Seems to be just one of these temporary aberrations of bowel function. That's a bit of a nuisance. Then there are several different types of antidiarrheals out there that can be effective. Such as loperamide. That can be taken after each loose bowel movement and then will gradually bring the problem to a halt."

#Lucifer #DevilTraining #TomEllis","Hello, I'm Tom Ellis. I play Lucifer on the show Lucifer and I'm going to show you today. My training regime that I used to get into shape especially for season four of Lucifer hashtag devil training. Let's give it again. So before I do any lifting, I like to start by having a good 20 minute warm up on the treadmill so I'll do 5 minutes of an easy nice place jog and then I'll do intermittently 45 seconds of Sprint so I'll crank it up to about 12 miles an hour for a Sprint for 45 seconds and take it back down to a walking pace for about four miles an hour. And I'll do that until I get 20 minutes. And then I've got my blood pumping and I'm ready to go. When we were getting in shape Lucifer season four, I really wanted to gain some muscle mass and so the best way to do that was consult my trainer Palo Palo, everybody and basically Palace suggested that we did. Well, we're gonna train six days a week, but we do four days of it is at the upper lower body, split using big compound movements. Get the big muscles going so an upper body day will contain things like this, the bench press. So when we're doing the bench press, we're working to try and build that lean muscle mass. So I'll put a heavyweight on there. I'll do somewhere between 8 to 10 reps and we'll do that four times. So this is an oldie but a goodie. It's the classic wide grip pull up now. I can do any of these beginning of the year, but a lot of practice keep your core engaged. Get under it nicely and go for it. What you meant to breathe out on the way up? I'm slow back down as I say I couldn't do any of these beginning of the year, so I've slowly built up to doing probably about 10 reps on my first go and it will slowly come down to 8/6 and probably 6 again. I'll try and do four sets of those. Another great compound movement to get the shoulders fired that I'd like to do this at the start of my my upper body days is the overhead seated shoulder press. I'd like to try and start heavy, so I've got £40 on each arm parallel. He's so good if you have got a trainer and using heavy weights it's great to help you get into position without injuring yourself. So if we get them up with a swing 321. In position. And a nice. Get a good depth on them. And it's going to explode upwards. The slow contracting is just as important for the muscle building as doing it for the exercises quickly. Let's do one more, yeah. And then just to get them down safely, tuck them into your body. So if you really want to carve out those shoulders, a great Superset exercise to do with the overhead presses is single arm cable lateral raise. So get the cable. You don't have to overload. This way you're going for good, clean reps, so straight up down to the side. Down to the side you superset this, we go bed presses. We do four sets of each one with minimal rest in between. And his shoulders will bleed. OK, time to get the guns going. I'm going to use the classic single arm bicep curl, except we don't need heavy weights. People use heavy weights and often cheat by swinging their bodies. I'm going for a flat surface on my back. My flat against here. That's it, and then you want to get your elbows pinned in like this and you want nice slow contractions. Then bring them both up like that. Keep them together and just lower. Slowly one. That I'm nice. Long controlled movements. Why am I talking so slowly? So in terms of reps and sets, we're doing 10 reps on each arm, which if you work it out, there's 20 reps back and forth and you want slow steady movements and we do that four times. So one of the best exercises you can do on leg day is the classic squat. It fires up all the big muscles. You get a nice good heavyweight good form and come down and open up. Horses every. This is not really. I'm going to wait till today, but normally I'd stack it up with about 60 to 70 kilos. It's all about form and protecting your back. Oh my bum feels nice right? Well that's just a few exercises from the the devil training that I do with Paolo. Always have a good 10 to 15 minute stretch afterwards. I have to these days 'cause I'm getting old and I need a load of this stuff. Keep hydrated, eat clean and you'll see the difference. Ladies."

#EthanSuplee #AmericanGlutton #MotherlessBrooklyn","Looking like a wolf man. What happened to you? I just gave your mom a piggyback ride and she weighs twice as much. Hi, I'm Ethan. Simply we're at Grant Roberts Granite gym in Beverly Hills. We're going to be doing a chest workout today. You may know me, or you may not know me anymore from such movies as remember the Titans, American History X Blow, Cold Mountain, Mallrats, my name is Earl or any of the above. I've lost a lot of weight and I am focusing now on retaining as much muscle as possible while I continue to. Lose weight in order to do that, I have to trick my body into thinking it needs the muscle to survive. So while in a caloric deficit I have to lift heavy weights so that my body thinks it needs the muscle to keep finding food, my heaviest I was 530 plus which I maxed out the scale at 5:30. I'm now 260 in between there there was a weight loss and weight gain. I met a girl who. I felt was more important than all of the girls I'd known previous to her and losing weight and getting healthy was the only way that I could see on on making sure I had the longest time with her. Alright, this is going to be a push workout. We're working out today with Grant Roberts, and the first thing we're going to do is a little pre activation, right? We're going to reactivate on the power plate, but this is the vibrating platform. The vibrate side to side, front and back in a very synchronistic matter, so it's not a foot massager, was actually created by the Soviet space program because weights would be useless in space, but he's going to assume a pushup position and a half plank. And basically what happens on this is gorgeous. The muscle with oxygen blood, so it's much better than the cold stretch. Go ahead and drop it down. Pretty exciting stuff. Now that I'm preactivated, we're going to move on to the next workout. This is an inclined fly to press. I'll be doing 10 reps of the fly and then eight presses will be trying to create a little muscle damage so that our bodies have something to repair. Awesome. She's looking away with this one. The next exercise is a reverse bench press. This is low chest and triceps. This is one of my favorite total chest workouts. It's the cable scoop I'm going to do. 10 reps. OK, on to the next workout. We're transitioning from chest into triceps. This is going to be an upper chest pull over to a tricep press so it'll be 10 pullovers and eight to 10 tricep press. Got it done, just. This is our last exercise. It's a tricep finisher. I'll be doing Skullcrusher holds 8 reps hold followed by 5 reps. Hold followed by three reps hold followed by one Rep. And that's again. This pretty much finishes the workout. Alright guys, thanks for joining me for my big push workout. I've found lifting weights to be really important while I lose weight to retain muscle tomorrow, I will do a pole workout which is almost entirely back and biceps. Thanks for watching. See you later."

#JudgmentDay #Terminator","Hey Ernie, we're here to see your gym in fridge. What do you want? Alright, Arnold, we're here to see your fridge you ready. Let's do it. What is it exactly that you want to see in the fridge? You just want to see the food? Or do you want to bust me because I'm not 100% vegan? What is it that you have to follow me? So anyway, this is the refrigerator in my office. We have here fruits with vegetables. We have one of my favorite things that when it gets hot, I have watermelons cut up watermelons. We have, of course the rattler which is a German drink, a combination of lemonade and beer and love it. Most people don't know this, but it's been secret protein drink. Don't tell anyone. OK, this is between us. OK, so here we go with the protein you wanted to see how a protein is made. It's nothing special about it. I just put in a little bit of this almond milk. Not much, just a little bit. And those are for muscle soreness, and sometimes bone soreness. Put a little bit of that in there. Then you go and you put the banana in. I don't do it always with clean hands. When I touch every dumbbell and barbell machine that other people have already touched, but it's just a good immune system, going into really always be able to fight back. Now there's an acre Oleg that we put in there for actually, I like to put in the whole egg. Now this drink. Literally, you could serve. At any bar, health bar or any other bar, I sometimes put in their schnapps, I sometimes put in there the killer. So it just gives you the extra flavor. What does your diet look like these days? Unless you can see I'm health conscious. I wasn't always health conscious because when it was young you know you get away with a lot of things for a little bit from that and now eat more. You know, like oatmeals and greens and vegetables and healthy foods. Stay away more from the meats and more from animal products. Animal proteins, because there was this misconception. It's the only way you get big and strong. So now I've backed off that and I feel much better at being one. Greens, you cook it all. Yeah, of course. My favorite thing to cook is of course take a lot of times. My bodybuilding friends come over to my kitchen or come over here. To this office and they won't, of course, eat the delicious food because they all want to look like me. It's never gonna happen. I love that anyway. What kind of snacks do you eat? I've, you know, during the day I have a make a little protein drink, of course, because I think this is the best, you know. We have the ladder proteins, then mix it with some of the the milk here and sometimes chooses. And then some of them have energy drinks also, and so it really depends what kind of a mood that I'm in and if I'm tired or not because our energy drink is really great when you're tired. Do you drink cows milk? I would say that I hate cows milk. I think almond milk this is much better. What other foods do you hate? I don't really hate much of anything, I just stay away from it because of health reasons. But I mean, I'm I always was called the garbage disposal because I was never sick and tired of anything. I mean anything. Is a method that would go to restaurants and I would say to people make me an omelet and they said, what do you want to be in the omelet? And they said anything that's in the kitchen sink or anything that you can find on the kitchen floor. Just scrape it up and put it in there and I would love it. And that's exactly what they did. Have you ever tried a fad diet like keto or intermittent fasting? And I saw the film, I don't have time for fat tires or anything like that. I have to go and go into real serious kind of a regimen. I broke out harder and do more cardiovascular training. And I watched much more with AIDS. I cut out just simply all the sugar products and I cut out all the white bread. Do you take any supplements? Yeah, big supplements that they go multivitamins and they you know everything that the body needs. And but like I said called supplements. The supplement of what you eat. So the key thing is it's not to rely on a supplement as much as you rely on good food. Natural food, lot of greens, lot of fruits and a lot of really good proteins. Does Arnold ever have a cheat day cheat? Days come up? Quite frequently I just remembered that even three days before the Mr. Olympia competition in 1970, after training, he will go to the House of Pies. So the key thing is always to remember that for every calorie you take in, you got to burn it off. There's no one else is going to do it for you. You got to do it. How often do you workout? I workout everyday, I work out in the morning of around 7:00 to 7:45 and then I ride the bicycle every morning when I'm 45 minutes and then many times they go back at night. It'll workout at home in my home gym. What do you consider an intense workout? Well, what I'm doing right now is not what I consider an intense workout. This is kind of like Mickey Mouse workout because we're doing the filming right now, so it just goes through the motions. But I'm not really training that heavy anymore. Because. After my heart surgery. Was advised not between heavy and not to do any work going for three reps and the heaviest weight in order stuff, so I do more kind of lighter weights and more reps. Do you still chase the pump? The pump is always out there and we always have to chase after it. Yes, it's the best thing for your career when you become a world champion in bodybuilding and you. Reach your goal like I did after winning 13 World Championship titles in the seven times. Mr. Olympia five times. Mr universe. Mr International. All this kind of competitions. Then it is important to inspire others. Because I recognize that I did not go where I am today, I did not reach this point in bodybuilding when anything else without inspiration of so many people. If it is in bodybuilding, rich Park or Steve briefs, you know, and in public service Ronald Reagan or Mother Teresa Mohammed Ali, there was one of the most generous, most giving person that inspired me to give something back to the community. There's always people inspired me, so to me. It's important to hang on the wall and do you have other people look up there and say so look what this guy has accomplished. He came over here from Austria with absolutely nothing and he became the world champion in bodybuilding and he became the highest paid movie actor in the leading man. And then he got into politics whatever his dream was, he accomplished because of hard work and because of a lot of help. And so I'm I want to be an inspiration to so many others. All right now, it's time for our rapid fire questions. 7:00 AM workout. 7 PM 7:00 AM usually squat deadly when you say squat or deadlift is the same thing as saying drinking or eating. I mean, I think we need both right? So therefore it's a crazy question we should try to workout the whole body in minimum of three times a week. CrossFit yay or nay. I think it's good done the right way. Dumbbells, a kettlebell. It makes no difference because the muscle doesn't see where you're holding in your hands. Running on a treadmill or in the great outdoors. Both biggest compliment Jack rips wool or cut. If you could work out with. Anyone in the world dead or alive, who would it be? I would like to workout with Eugene Sandow. With one of my idols it was the first bodybuilder that also was a small man. I think that he's a remarkable human being as a remarkable athlete and strong man. You know, a lot of celebrities on gym and fridge say you're their ultimate workout partner. What do you say to that I'm here Gold's Gym every morning. If you want to workout coming down and we have a good time. Alright. Listen guys, I gotta get back to my room. OK, time for fooling around is over so. Exit and don't say I'll be back OK."

#Glass #TheBeast","Hi, I'm magnet slickback, the founder of the Magnus method. Today I'm going to show you one of the days from the Beast program that I did with James McAvoy to build him for glass. We didn't have much time so we had about three months to pack as much muscle mass as possible to make him look as. Freakish as possible, but at the same time you know move like a beast. OK, let's get started. Lat Pull Downs is a great fundamental back exercise that will target the lats alongside a lot of smaller muscles. So you wanna make sure to stretch out your shoulders, then lower them and then you pull so it's super important to get that lowering motion before you start pulling and Hunter is also pushing his chest forward and retracting his scapular control. The movement explosive on the way down and resistance on the way up, eccentric. Standing alternating role is one of my favorite alternatives to a regular role, so we start with the dumbbells on the hip. You're leaning forward. Let your skiing downhill and your retracting the scapula. You fall into the middle. And then you pull back up. Some resistance on the way down and explosive. On the way back up, we're going to target the back to laps to run Boyds, and we're going to work isometric core anti rotation. So our next exercise is a straight arm pull down. So Hunter is going to take a step back Bend knee, attract the scapula and start pulling down code just outside of the. To me and come back up tight. So this is a great exercise for not only the core, but shoulders and a lot of smaller muscles in the back. Actually, we're going to do a superset here, so we're going to do 12 reps and then we're going to go straight into another exercise right after this. So our next exercise is straight ARM race. So Hunter is going to. Step over the rope. He's going to lean forward. It's going to retract the scapula. The shoulders back and lift up. Explosive on the way up a bit slower on the way down and you want to make sure that the cable doesn't touch, so adjust the angle. Our next exercise is a reverse fly hunters gonna shrug back, retract the shoulder blades and lift straight up and slowly come back down. This is a great exercise to work the outside shoulders, backside shoulders, little rotator cuff rhomboids. So we're going to do a great finisher or something. You can do just outside of this workout as well, and it's illicit crawl with free progressions, so Hunter is going to show you the first progression here. Pushing down and this is great to build push strength and hip and spinal mobility. So with the second progression, you execute the push up with one arm. For James asked the beast, we needed him to move in a certain way, so that was crucial to us to use a couple of those type of exercises. So on his last progression. You want to stay as close to the floor as possible, and it requires a lot more push strength to execute this third progression. So that was one day from the Beast program. I would do this about two times per week. These exercises will will give you great pulling strength, building a lot of mass in the back and also with movement quality and control. I hope you guys enjoyed it and can take something from this and do it in the gym. Go and have fun with it."

For this basic gym necessity, you shouldn't settle for anything other than perfect form—especially because of the heavy weights you'll eventually be working to pull. Let Men's Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., guide you through the exercise's subtleties, saving you from the bad habits that are keeping you from unlocking your fitness potential.

Before grabbing your barbell (or dumbbells or hexbar), take note that this it's extremely important to pay attention to the details here. You might think you need a lifting belt or straps to even step up to the bar, but as you'll soon learn, that's not the case. Forget the gear—just be ready to learn how to lift a ton of weight.

Men's Health on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/menshealthmag/","Hey guys, I'm Ebenezer Samuel fitness director for men's health I'm Brett Williams, associate fitness editor at men tell today we're going to teach you guys to deadlift. The deadlift is one of the most ****** moves in the gym. Once you master it, you're going to move more weight on this exercise than you do on any exercise in this gym. I guarantee you that the key to doing the deadlift though. You have to do it right. A lot of people messes lift up, but we're going to show you all the things you need to know about it right now. So Brett, let's get right into it. So he's gonna step up to the bar feet shoulder width apart. Toes are across the bar. You should be able to count your toes on the other side of that bar. Now Brett go down. Let's go get that bar using a nice overhand grip. Here you want to stay in that overhand grip. You're going to see a lot of people use what's called a mixed grip. That's fine when you get very heavy in weight. It's gonna let you move larger weight, but you don't want to do that to start out. You wanna train from this overhand position as much as you possibly can now, no. Also his back position, his hips are lower than his shoulders. The one thing you're gonna see a lot of people do, you're gonna see their hips higher than their shoulders. Then you're lifting with your lower back. Remember, we never want to do that you want to really use your hamstrings to get this lift to happen? Now he's going to set his lats. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together. He's got his pull the slack out of the bar next. This is another little way to help set your lats. Keep your back involved in this because remember, you don't want your shoulders hanging out to dry to lift this weight. You want everything nice and tight. Your core needs to be hugely involved in this lift. Again, you want to protect your lower back, so he's got that nice core position and now lift that weight right up. Squeezes his glutes at the top. Note that you're going to see a lot of people overextend. Show them what that looks like, Brett. You don't wanna do that. You wanna stay nice and smooth. Just squeeze your glutes at the top. Stand up in a good position. That's a deadlift. Put it right back down, Brett. Also he comes down, he sets that bar we're not doing touch and go deadlifts. We're trying to teach you a nice fundamental deadlift that you can use to lift heavyweight. This is the kind of exercise you can get a lot out of it if you're just doing 123 reps sets because you can go real heavy. Build that power on your backside, build a lot of strength. There you have it. The basics of the deadlift as you progress in this move as you start to learn more, you're going to see people starting to use belts and straps. Try to avoid belts in particular. You really want to create that force by yourself. Let your core be its own belt. Instead of trying to go down that road with the belt straps as you start to use more resistance, you're going to want some of that that can help you. It is gonna take a little bit away from your grip, so again, try to train with that overhand grip without the straps, as long as possible. Start to integrate the mixed grip, and then as you get really heavy, you can start using straps a little bit as well. We'd love to see you guys doing 6 to 8 reps, sets three or four sets. This is also a move that as you get better at it, you can get a lot of benefit out of 123 reps sets going really heavy. So work towards that, but again, start with three sets of 6 to 8 for now."

#ArnoldSchwarzenegger","And then they share it with all of you, and I wish I could just pour it into the lens to share it with all the people out there. Because this is so yummy. OK, so here we go. With the protein you wanted to see how a protein is made. It's nothing special about it, I just put in a little bit of this almond milk. Not much, just a little bit. Then for the taste and also for muscle soreness and sometimes bounce soreness with a little bit of that in there. Then you go and put the banana in. I don't do it always. With clean hands where I touch every dumbbell and barbell and machine that other people have already touched, but it's just to get their immune system going and they really always be able to fight back. OK, so here we go with the protein. Now there's an egg roll egg that we put in there. Well, actually I like to put in the whole egg. Now this drink. Literally, you could serve. At any bar, health bar or any other bar, I sometimes put in their schnapps, I sometimes put in there the killer, so it just gives you little extra flavor. I'm telling you guys, I'm going to share it with all of you. They wish I could just boil into the lens to share with all the people out there because this is so yummy I have to have another sip. Excuse me. I don't believe in this pre and post because it's all a bunch of nonsense. Or as George discovers a bunch of crap. Because the reality of is the body doesn't care. The body just loves this. The body loves protein vitamins in order throughout the whole day, 24 hours a day. So why do you say I have to do this at 2:00 in the morning or at three in the afternoon? Or post work order pre working? Or no I can drink this before I go to the gym and I can drink this after I go to the gym. It doesn't matter you can workout also anytime you want people make all this stuff to complicate it, just don't think. Just do it. Have your food supplements drink your protein drinks and workout everyday. Just do it. That is the important thing rather than talk about it and analyzing it. And you do the warm up set and you do so in so many reps and you do that. Come on, let's get real here. Let's just do it."

#CCSabathia #MLB #TrainLikeACelebrity","So my peak I was 342 and now I've set from 280 to 85. The big man. He's also a very good athlete. Here's the 1/2 delivered struck him out. Sabathia, a complete game. What's up everybody? See Sabathia here. Retired baseball player. I'm here with my trainer Dave Paladino. I'm here to talk to you guys about my transformation and how important working how it is to me now. I was 342 with my heaviest and every time you know I would get that high. Or you know, being three 30s I would just think that like man, there's no way I can live like this like I'm. I'm not going to see 5060 years old, you know, hypertension and heart disease. All those things running my family and then having the heart you know problem. In 2018 he was the one that actually sent me to the hospital I was in there working out and looked at. Yeah he was like bro you white, he was like you need to go get checked out went in. I did a stress test, couldn't get through it. I was like 2 minutes into the stress test and they were like you gotta you gotta put it in here. I called my cardiologist I called Amber. I said something's wrong so he was the one that actually caught it. It's taking us about 18 months to get here, but yeah, I mean this is this is always the plan. We work out six days a week, you know. So I work out some pretty plan. Today is with our armed day so you know our arm days are pretty heavy. Pretty hectic. Like you said it's it's all show no go so it's all curls and you know beep stuff. So I should be in front of workout. Alright, let's get into it. So the warm up will do a superset. We're gonna start off by using the TRX band. We're gonna have him use some body weight curls. Get a little blood flow, usually superset that with the anti push up warm up a little bit of the tricep, move his big body around. I'd like to get his blood flow in that way. He's able to do pushups. I can rip out multiple pushups across the board will go from our warm up to the hammer curl 'cause I like to hit his outside part of the biceps when I workout by myself. He sends me a workout and I do hammer curls in between whatever workout he thinks it could be. A back legs whenever I super said it with hammer curls every second quarter quarantine he was hammer curling all day. From that point a pre stretch motion on this cable apparatus where he's curling the dual cables and say Hi Rep range there from 12 to 15 reps. So I'd like to kind of hit both heads and different angles. It's all about angles within his arms are extremely developed and very large right now, and what I've been doing is just basically sculpting them and they're just, you know they are OK. So after the bicep we're going to jump right into the triceps, we'll do a rope pushdown. I'd like to use the rope because see flares out at the bottom, hits the outer head on him a lot, and he's got a very very pronounced outer head. So I like to hit that, make it look even better, right? So after the real push that we're going to finish off what tricep Superset consisting of the kickback for the back of the Tri set and the enclosed pushup depended upon? We always stay around four sets, five sets, 10 to 15 reps, so to push up we'd like to focus in vertical grip. C focus is keeping us elbows. Going up across the inside part of his body to put more pressure on the tricep than a regular traditional pushup would have put more pressure on your chest and anterior deltoid. So we'd like to focus in tight stuff where he's moving his body for his tricep. Alright, so that was a day in the life I'm here in the basketball court by the putting some shots. If I can do it, you see me do it. You see action do it. Anybody can do it. Stick with it and stick with the middle plan. Workout hard and it'll all pay off."

Written and created by Mitchell Moffit (twitter @mitchellmoffit) and Gregory Brown (twitter @whalewatchmeplz).","More than 10 million sports related injuries occur in the world every year. To avoid this, athletes and coaches alike are using a variety of pre competition techniques to decrease injuries and increase performance. But what does science tell us about stretching and warming up? Many studies have looked at how stretching can affect athletic performance, and it turns out it depends on the activity. Sports such as figure skating and snowboarding which require a wide range of motions to impress the judges certainly benefit from an athlete's flexibility. But for power sports like speed skating and bobsledding, too much stretching may actually cause a temporary decrease in muscle strength. The overstretched muscle becomes less responsive and can stay weekend for up to 30 minutes, although athletic competitions can be strenuous. There's little evidence to suggest that stretching before or after a competition decreases muscle soreness. Some studies have even noted that extreme flexibility can lead to an increase in the range of stretching without pain, and if you can't feel pain, the body doesn't know when to stop pushing. As a result, injuries can occur. Another large study of athletes found that the least and most flexible participants were 2.5 times more likely to incur an injury. So when it comes to flexibility and competitive sports, it's most beneficial to be moderately flexible. A well designed warmup is also extremely beneficial. The term itself comes from the positive effects of raising the temperature of your body before a competition, slowly increasing physical intensity prior to a sport increases muscle temperature, ultimately allowing your muscles to contract more forcefully. More forceful contractions equals more strength and power. Furthermore, slowly adding movement to your muscles opens up the blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily throughout the body and decreases the strain on your heart. Finally, as your blood temperature increases, your blood cells actually hold less oxygen. This loose oxygen is then free to be used by your muscles, increasing overall endurance. Science says it's important not to overstretch it when it comes to flexibility, but physically warming up your body before each specific sport might help you burn the competition. Don't forget we have a new video out every day during the Olympics. Can't wait our amazing partners at the CBC. I already have five of the videos up now for you to binge on.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg,What makes muscles grow? - Jeffrey Siegel,"View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-makes-muscles-grow-jeffrey-siegel

We have over 600 muscles in our bodies that help bind us together, hold us up, and help us move. Your muscles also need your constant attention, because the way you treat them on a daily basis determines whether they will wither or grow. Jeffrey Siegel illustrates how a good mix of sleep, nutrition and exercise keep your muscles as big and strong as possible. 

Lesson by Jeffrey Siegel, animation by Brett Underhill.","Muscles we have over 600 of them. They make up between one third and 1/2 of our body weight and along with connective tissue, they bind us together, hold us up and help us move and whether or not bodybuilding is your hobby, muscles need your constant attention because the way you treat them on a daily basis determines whether they will wither or grow. Say you're standing in front of a door, ready to pull it. Open your brain and muscles are perfectly poised to help you achieve this goal. First, your brain sends a signal to motor neurons inside your arm. When they receive this message, they fire, causing muscles to contract and relax, which pull on the bones in your arm and generate the needed movement. The bigger the challenge becomes, the bigger the brain signal grows and the more motor units it rallies to help you achieve your task. But what if the door is made of solid iron? At this point your arm muscles alone won't be able to generate enough tension to pull it open, so your brain appeals to other muscles. For help, you plant your feet, tighten your belly and tense your back, generating enough force to yank it. Open. Your nervous system has just leveraged the resources you already have other muscles to meet the demand. While all this is happening, your muscle fibers undergo another kind of cellular change. As you expose them to stress, they experience microscopic damage, which in this context is a good thing. In response, the injured cells release inflammatory molecules called cytokines that activate the immune system to repair the injury. This is when the muscle building magic happens. The greater the damage to the muscle tissue, the more your body will need to repair itself. The resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles bigger and stronger as they adapt to progressively greater demands. Since our bodies have already adapted to most everyday activities, those generally don't produce enough stress to stimulate new muscle growth. So to build new muscle, a process called hypertrophy, our cells need to be exposed to higher workloads than they are used to. In fact, if you don't continuously expose your muscles to some resistance, they will shrink a process known as muscular atrophy. In contrast, exposing the muscle to a high degree of tension, especially while the muscle is lengthening, also called an eccentric contraction, generates effective conditions for new growth. However, muscles rely on more than just activity to grow. Without proper nutrition hormones and rest, your body would never be able to repair damaged muscle fibers. Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building blocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids. Adequate protein intake along with naturally occurring hormones like insulin like growth factor and testosterone help shift the body into a state where tissue is repaired and grown. This vital repair process mainly occurs when we're resting, especially at night while sleeping. Gender and age affect this repair mechanism, which is why young men with more testosterone. Have a leg up in the muscle building game. Genetic factors also play a role in one's ability to grow muscle. Some people have more robust immune reactions to muscle damage and are better able to repair and replace damaged muscle fibers, increasing their muscle building potential. The body responds to the demands you place on it. If you tear your muscles up, eat right, rest and repeat. You'll create the conditions to make your muscles as big and strong as possible. It is with muscles. As it is, with life, meaningful growth requires challenge and stress."

===

You may be among the vast majority of the population who is misinformed about warming up and stretching before a workout. Whether you mistakenly assumed or were instructed to stretch out as a precursor to your workout, you may have been putting your muscles at greater risk.

Many individuals think that they are moving or using their muscles during the workout so they need to stretch them before moving; however, research indicates that warming up is a necessary first step to protect the muscles and body.

Take a look at these research studies showing the importance of a correct warm-up and it's effects on a workout:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167945716302986
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3849057
http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/14/935
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22067244
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15377965

The importance of warm up exercises can be compared to driving your car in freezing cold weather. It is generally best to allow your car to warm up a bit before revving it up to high speeds. The same principle applies when you work out. You want to physically prepare your body for the demands of a strenuous workout by gradually increasing your body temperature.

Hey everyone, I'm coach Brian strength coach here with criticalbench.com and I'm giving you the warm up or the stretching routine that you need to use before you workout so a lot of people come to me and say hey what's a good way to warm up? Well, First off you should get yourself on a treadmill, a bike and elliptical or Stairmaster and spend 510 minutes on there doing some light aerobic work. I'm not talking something like sprints, but something that will elevate your heart rate. Get your breathing a little bit and maybe even get a little sweat coming out, but from there you want to go into. I call it a dynamic warm up or a dynamic stretching routine. That's going to help you help the body prepare yourself for what's ahead in your workout. It doesn't matter if you're doing legs or arms, this is a good routine that you can follow. So first one is just some basic leg swings. Hold on to something, swing the leg. Very simple, both sides, 10 swings per side, and then you're going to go to a lateral swing. Hold on to something swinging across. That's it, right there so these might not seem like stretches, but they are. They're dynamic stretches. They're going through a great range of motion. They're going to help loosen up and prepare your body for work. The next one is a stationary knee hug, alternating sides again, maybe 5 reps per side. This is going to help the hamstrings, glutes, switch to quads. Quads right here. Alternate sides again, 5 reps per side. Next one is going into a soldier kick. Very simple. Nothing fancy about this. Arm circles it could do some arm circles right here again, none of these exercises are going to be static in their design. Research shows that dynamic movement before workout is going to be best. Criss crosses. Again, there really is no set number of repetitions to be five. 10:15 you go for half a minute and the main thing is you just want to move through a great range of motion. Getting that heart rate up. See, I'm already breathing harder by doing these. So real quick, I just said 3 minutes worth of dynamic stretches and I'm feeling pretty good. You can always incorporate some more dynamic movements like plyometrics, jumping jacks, jump ropes, some floor mobility work. Those are great ways to stretch out the muscles that are going to be used for exercise, but the main idea is that you want to be dynamic in your format for warming up. Save all your static stretching towards the end if that's what you want to do, but personally I just say. Stick the dynamic and you'll be good to go. There's something else I'd love to share with you. It's a report that wrote on stretching. It's called why stretching won't make you flexible. You got to get it and it's going to kind of open your eyes up to a different types of training in for stretching and flexibility. One or two ways to get is to go to this corner where I'm pointing.

The problem is that they're not exactly sure what they're doing in there. The environments of the equipment that the exercises, and, heck, even the fashion trends can be difficult to grasp to enlighten some of our fellow beginner Bros. And bralettes, and even some of you seasoned gym goers. Here are five beginner gym mistakes that you might want to fix. Number one you use only machines. There's nothing exactly wrong with machines as they do simplify many exercises and are for the most part easy to use, but its simplicity has its drawbacks. One is then machines typically accommodate only average height ranges, making it tough to use if you're too short or too tall. Some machines also follow unnatural movement paths, which can be uncomfortable to use. Free weights are much more well free, allowing you to work with better, more natural patterns. Also one huge disadvantage. Is the lack of strengthening stabilizer muscles machines already? Have you set any fixed stable position? Thus you won't need to kick in much of your stabilizers to keep balance and control free weights and contrast will require just that. Now again, that doesn't mean machines aren't good at all. In fact, one of the best machines in all of fitness are the cable machines, but they do still have their limitations, and it's important to integrate free weight exercises into your program wherever you see fit, especially if your goal is overall fitness #2. You're doing way too many isolation exercises. Yes, I'm talking to you, the one staring in the mirror while doing your 18th set of bicep curls. Believe it or not, there's more to being in shape than the size of your arms. These single joint isolation exercises like curls, side raises and tricep pushdowns only tend to focus on one muscle group at a time. Large compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and shorter presses however, hit multiple muscle groups at once, meaning more work in significantly less time compound movements. Also allow you to work with much heavier weights, which is great if you want to build overall strength and muscle. Now, isolation exercises are still important, they are great at hitting specific muscles that need more work, and they're more effective in controlling specific volume targets for any given muscle. But the point is, don't stick with isolations, only do your compound movements too if not more so. Number three, you only use light weights. It's understandable that beginners will hesitate to lift heavy. However, avoid doing so goes against one key fitness component progressive overload. The concept that one must persistently increase the demand placed on the muscles to effectively become stronger and bigger. Sure, you might toss on a few more pounds once in awhile, but nothing even close to your maximal potential. You need to push your limits for results, especially if the goal is getting stronger. Studies repeatedly show that. Strength gains are best achieved when lifting heavy. That means you need to lift a weight. You can only do maybe five or three reps Max, or even just once, and then after you achieve that, try even more the next time around. No more 40 Rep sets unless your goal is strictly endurance. And before wrapping up the last two, I want to give a quick shout out to the picture fit Discord community. For those of you unfamiliar with discord, it is a chat service originally created for gamers, but it's also proven to be great for other communities, including health and fitness. Our picture fit community have lots of great people sharing advice each day. Overall, we've been tremendously successful in creating a fun yet mature and helpful environment. If you feel like you need help with your goals or want to help other Bros and bralettes or even want to just chat with me and others. Then please come check out the Discord community today. Registration is super quick and easy. Just follow the link in the description. Now #4 you don't bring along a bottle of water a simple but crucial mistake many people make not just beginners, but thing is our body is 2/3 of water and on average we sweat off roughly one liter of water for every hour of exercise. If we didn't replenish the lost water, it can lead to dehydration, which comes with many nasty symptoms like muscle cramps, fatigue, poor concentration and headaches qualities. You certainly wouldn't want during your physical activities. The simple fix is to bring that water bottle with you. There's really no reason not to, and it's better than relying on the gym's water fountain. Also, if you're doing anything super intense or long endurance, you might want to consider a sports drink or coconut water instead to help replenish the loss of electrolytes. Plus it has sugars which replenish energy stores. Just make sure you account for the added sugars into your overall diet. And finally #5 you don't ask for help. There has been a long built stigma of anti social sentiment in the gym. Unsolicited fitness advice is often discouraged since no one likes to be told what to do even with the best of intentions. But such a contentious pride to be independent means we suck at asking for help. As a beginner, there's no doubt you'll need all the help you can get. We also have studies showing that people with social and or coaching supports are much more likely to be successful. With their goals, it's both a motivational and educational benefit to have someone encouraging and helping you along the way. I am personally a huge advocate of working with actual professionals, even personal trainers, with enough due diligence, but I understand not everyone has the financial means to do so. In that case, put your pride aside and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Contrary to popular belief, Gym Bros and bralettes are more than happy to help. After all, they understand how difficult it once was as a beginner themselves. And that's five gymnastics you might want to start working on. As a beginner, I hope you left this video with at least some extra knowledge you can take to the gym if you enjoy the video, don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe for more future videos. Also, again, please come check out the picture Fit Discord community for more help on your fitness goals. As always, thank you for watching and happy lifting and get your protein."

None better or more fun to follow than Kobe and Shaq. They won three titles in a row together. With their teammates from the city of Los Angeles. And their names will be linked for all time. Please welcome Shaquille O'Neal. When I have imagined speaking to a group of people about Kobe Bryant. I usually pitch in the context of his Hall of Fame induction. Or as a guest speaker. When a Kobe and Vanessa Foundation event. But never ever could have imagined that I'd be here today speaking at his memorial. And it pains me to my core. Like all of you. I continue to be devastated. The loss of my friend. My little brother. Kobe Bryant and my beautiful niece Gigi. To Vanessa and the kids. Kobe's parents, sisters and other families who lost their loved ones on their tragic day. We we, we grieve with you. All of us were forever changed on January 26. As we know, the black mom's legacy will be more than just being one of the greatest vessel players of all time. And believe me who Kobe was truly a gifted and intelligent student of the game. I remember him saying these guys are playing checkers and I'm out here playing chess. And I would say I guess, so Kobe, I don't know how to play chess. But I could tell you that Kobe what Phil Kobe heart was the most. Pride was his role as a loving husband to Vanessa Daddy to Gigi and Natalia, Bianca and baby Capri. And a loving son and brother, Koby was a loyal friend and her true Renaissance man. As many of you know, Kobe and I had a very complex relationship throughout the years, but not unlike another leadership duo, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, whose creative rivalry led to some of the greatest music of all time. Kobe and I push one another to play some of the greatest basketball of all time, and I am proud that no other team has accomplished what the three peat Lakers have done since checking and the Kobe Lakers did it. And yes, sometimes I get mature kids. We argued we folks, we banner dorsel did each other with offhand remarks. Our field, but make no mistake, it wouldn't folks thought we were on bad terms when the cameras were turned off, he and I would throw a wink at each other and say let's go whoop some ***. You never took it seriously and truth, Cobain, I always maintained a deep respect and a love for one another. Today again, the day Kobe gave my respectless the guys were complaining. So sure, Kobe is not passing the ball. I said. I'll talk to him. I said Kobe. There's no I in team and Kobe said, I know, but there's a in me in that. So we're back. So I went back and told Rick and I and Big Shell Baba said just get the rebound. He's not passing. Mama, you were taken away from us way too soon. Your next chapter of Life is just beginning. But now it's time for us to continue your legacy. You said yourself that everything negative pressure challenges is all the opportunity for me to rise. So we now take that sage advice and now rise from anguish and begin with the healing. Just know that we got your back little brother. I'll look after things down here. I'll be sure to teach Natalia Bianca and baby Capri all your moves. And I promise I will not teach you my free throw techniques. But for now. I take comfort, in fact, as we speak, Kobe and Gigi are holding hands, walking to the nearest basketball court. Kobe will show her some new Mama moves today and GG soon message him. Kobe or heavens MVP. I love you, my man till we meet again. Rest in peace Kobe."

#UFC","And of all the superlatives. Cute. Cheap. Well, you can hear the corner of patient, patient, patient and stupid corner telling it's got to get the offense going a little bit. How do you like that with the jab and then off the low kick? Nice advance there by the champion. Absolutely just has to enter the fire a little bit in order to Francis to fight him. Francis gotta be careful to not load up. And leave these big open. She's back. Finally, the greatest heavyweight in the world you wanted to fire when it gonna let you go sleep. Oh my goodness, wow, that was nasty. That's his nasty. When they're throwing, hear me. Otis feels like he hurts him. So did he goes OK I can go and look at this short left hook that just drops him. So short lights I mean short short importance of roses movement. She's got to be light on her feet she's got to create a lot of angles. Wrong way. Lee is a marauder. She comes forward and smashes and she will lies on that physicality. That power that endurance in that volume. I think Rose has to take the matter to it. Billy Jack from Jean Whaley Whaley. Now that inside leg kick, throwing hard early. It really is landed several of those inside locations. Stop. It's. He gave. Charge IT solvers 'cause she was moving so much. John Whaley expected low kick. Yes kick when hot. God that was perfect. I mean when rose number Eunice with title. It's all my pictures on the other side. Corisande Hagan, minus 360 as the favorite in the black tonight's my clock. It's brought to you by modello. Immediately saying hang up the outside. Frankie Edgar. Trademark pressure moving forward. You constantly moving. That's the one thing about Frankie Edgar. He doesn't leave his headset and it's always moving with his legs and his feet. You know in Russell we always say hands and feet move at the same time Frankie moves everything at the same time. Body movement feasible. Spider. Perfect so corisande Hagen with a highlight for the ages that title shot you gotta give it to him. That's how you get the title shot. There's nothing else you can move it. That's what you do to get his title shot. Explodes into that flying deep wow. Looking fresh and standing at the center of the Octagon goes up with the left lower back on the feet from Reyes. Costco, now he's trying to send once again, Bray is still firing back. Yeah, it's so impressive every time he fights off opens up, well, beautiful. Then he always fires back that left and he's just enough to stop the food momentum off the husk. It stops him from, you know, putting the nail in the coffin if you will. Ray is still firing back top this shown on each side. Gary Pro Haska spinning elbow pushing face first into the Octagon holy smokes. I mean look at this comes over the right elbow comes spins with the left, connects with the points and races down and out and he is not getting back anytime soon. Right Elbow left Elbow finds the target out like a light job done my work. Nice jab and nice head movement there for medicine. Shame is having a really good results with that low cap kit at some point. Wanted him to be more busy with the left right hand by Barboza. Oh he. And he tried to. Did Vantages gave out the poker face worked? Until the body said enough is enough. I mean watching mouth with all of the first round, right? Mazda dolls didn't have to rush like he did in the first fight because he had to empty the tank and ran one because he knew he only had a round of cardio. This time he was able to fight for the wrong one and he still feels good and confident. And of all the superlatives. Cute. Cheap. Oh my. And it's so perfect. Oh my goodness, she literally the perfect right hand. And there's no question whatsoever happens. Look at that. Look at how limp he is when he goes down. Watch after hits boom. Look at, he's out cold look you see him try to get up he's trying here in the hammerfist shut the lights out for good."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9zWBICvFoU,Shane Watson pays tribute to Shane Warne | The ICC Review,"“I was in Australian cricket’s scrap heap in 2008 because of the injuries, and Warnie always believed in me. He is the reason why I went to Rajasthan Royals.”

Shane Watson cherishes memories of time spent with Shane Warne.

Read more 👉 bit.ly/Watson-WarneTribute","It's been a challenging few weeks digesting everything that's happened. Firstly, how are you going and and and what was your relationship with Shane? Yeah, look, I I go through waves of how I'm going and it's more so when you start to talk about someone who's it's just hard to. It's just hard to comprehend that he's not not here with us anymore. Very fortunate like. Like Ricky Ponting was for me Shane Warne was the same mentor for me from the age of 20. The first time I came into the Aussie team Way took me under his wing and just cared cared for me my opportunity to get to continue to evolve my cricket at Hampshire. I played two years at Hampshire 2004 2005 to continue to evolve my career because of because of because of warning. Then gosh, I was on the really Australian cricket scrapheap in 2008 because of my injuries, in particular that I had. And warning you always, but he always believed in me and he there's a reason why I got to. I went to Rajasthan Royals to better have him captain and coach me for those four years at the Rajasthan Royals just turned me into a cricketer who was had a bit of belief in myself to believing I was. I was Superman and that's what he did to everyone around him. It wasn't just me and the skill that war he had 2008 IPL. Bringing a whole new group of players together, he was Captain coach, so he was absolutely running the show. His ability to be able to see the best parts of people and bring them together, like really quickly. That's the reason why you know. Rajasthan Royals did so well in year one because all the other teachers on scrambling to work out what their roles are, what their roles, whether people where they're going to fit in and warn you could just see it. And then he just knew how to tap into everyones best version of themselves and empowered everyone. And that's an incredible skill. Not many people have got that, and that's on the Kruger field. That's also off the Kruger field that was his superpower, that he that he had his ability to be able to see the bigger version of individuals. The bigger version of themselves. Yeah, and that's what. Everyone's going to be. It's like it's been a challenging time for everyone and he had such an impact on everyone around the world and including himself. Also, you can take your time with this, but. Was already particular conversation that you had with him that I guess, captures how important he was to your life. Gosh had a lot of conversations with with with Warney around, you know around life and and cricket. I suppose the. A couple in particular that just that stand out is just how he from a just. It was a cricket perspective also. In the end you look back in his life life perspective as well. Was he always talked about? Is that how it like? How to take the aggressive option? How to take the the positive option in any in any situation? So for me he turned my bowling around in particular from my mindset being really defensive mindset around like I don't get here. Try not to sort of go for boundaries where his mindset was always how my getting a wicket and he and in T20 cricket. So my mindset by playing under him at the Roger Stone rules, modern mindset shifted because of because of warning it was all around. How my how can I get a wicket right now to have an impact on the game and that's the reason why he was so ridiculously good because he always understood how to be able to try and get a wicket and that's what he had always. We'll be talking to his players about is. How can I take the positive option to be able to have an impact on the game and and my bowling as a starting point turned around immediately in T20 cricket because that's just the belief that he gave me in. OK, well, what's my skill? What's my best skill to be able to try and get this person out? So so those conversations and just. Gosh, she's advice around all different parts of life. There's always just someone who was was willing to. God just help out in any way. He was one person when I had my first commentary gig was the T20 World Cup last year. He was the one person who reached out to to provide some great words of support and encouragement and also advice. Because that's just what he did for his mates. Like he cared and any chance he could to be able to. Impart some wisdom to be able to help them be better versions themselves. That's just he took. He always took the time. Speaking to Ricky, he talked about. Being now a custodian of Shane Warne's mantras and. Being able to pass that on to the people around him and I guess you're in a similar privileged position to be able to do that now with your coaching and with people around you. So I guess what? What an honor that is. Sure. And that's I suppose the the realization of avoiding not being here anymore. I suppose it was the first time for me personally, where? Suppose I really realized my. You know my mortality that one day you you can be here and the next day you're you're not. And we thought we just gotta leave. You really do have to leave. Life to the fullest and do everything that you possibly can because you don't know how long you're gonna be here for and. That that is a starting point. As yeah, the manager that were needed, he lived. An incredible life even even though it was cut short and as a starting point, everything that you know I'll be continuing to live my life through that lens. And then you know the fortunate position that I was in to be able to learn so many of you know the way we went about other reason. What made him so good? It's now going to live through them. With imparting that knowledge onto, you know the people, the next generation of people that have cricketers and the people that I'm that I work with. You know, throughout the rest of my life as well. You're so right. I mean, he did. He lived his life to the fullest, and he probably achieved. As much in his 52 years as anyone does in maybe. 7080 years of their life. But yeah, I'm absolutely carrying that as well in terms of just trying to experience as much that life has to offer and. You know, that's that's exactly how he lived his life so. I think he'd be proud of us if we continue to do that. Shane that thanks so much. Really appreciate your time and. Yeah, I can see how, how much it's affecting you so I won't keep you much longer and the the carved yourself."

MS Dhoni got it right in the end. India the world champions. Big Shot, Lakeside 6 here we go last fall through the outside. Is he right? He's got him. That's it, indeed, win. That is brilliantly done. India win the Champions Trophy. As England capitulate the winners of the Champions Trophy 2013, India. Got it. Looking at catch super catch. That's you dude. Outside edge, good catch by MS Dhoni. Great shot. That's a fierce Quaker. It's going through the boundary like a tracer bullet. Finishes open start India lift the World Cup. After 28 years, the party started in the dressing room and it's an Indian captain who's been absolutely magnificent in the night of the fight."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vog7n-Wcb5k,'Fiery and unique' – A tribute to Lasith Malinga,"""He transformed the game in the sense that no one before or since has bowled the yorker with the accuracy that Lasith has done.""

A tribute to Lasith Malinga.","Lasted. Grateful. Transformed the game in the sense that no one. Before. Or since. Has called Yorker with curacy. That lasted has done. Brilliant. Millenia at his best. The action, I mean it's it's a characteristic action that he possesses and no one else possesses around the world and the ability to fire in that spearin Yorker to bowl that incredible slower ball with his arm going at the same pace. Well, every cricket writers dream actually like that in the surname to go with it. Slinger Malinga. They lasted was an absolute superstar. She was very smart, he thought really well about bowling and the game of cricket and that allowed him to be very creative with what he did and very effective with what he did. God as the coquillon. Cute. And I think we're very lucky to have him in the side because he was an out and out match winner. Full and full, this is brilliant. Whoever would have thought that this could possibly happen. He taught a lot of bowlers how to practice the yockers. He had the shoe that he kept in front of the stumps and he used to keep polling at the shoe. That's something that I see a lot of the young boys do so when you leave the game this is something that you want to help youngsters achieve something special and that is what he's given the cricketing world. That's something most of the young boys these days to practice bowling a Yorker. And how do they do it? The money. You think Lassie, you think, Yorkers, you think slower balls. You think she Lankan legend? Or talk to Prater. That is an outstanding your help with that combination of of yorkers and those dipping slower balls that have made in so difficult so the modern batsman combine that with his action, which is unusual and unorthodox, has made him one of the best white ball limited overs bowlers we've ever seen. This has been the most magnificent display of fast, hostile bowling. I think if Malinger had come up in some different countries mean he would have probably been coached bold differently. I think less of ****** was an outstanding bowl and one of the best T20 bowlers. One of the best bowlers. Throughout his. Free Lanka new champions. The ICC World do 20 well played. I remember being on a tour of Sri Lanka and we played in a warm up game and I opened it and this lad came on to buy. I think he got me out for a duck because I was looking here and the ball came from there and this lad just ran up and let it go like that. About 90 mile an hour and he was just so difficult to pick up and he got better with age. That Yorker that dipping slower ball. Over there. They are stumped, uprooted. Malinga takes a fifth wicket, small that he has on his face constantly. I think that's what he will be remembered for the most is the way he played his cricket. The spirit he played his cricket in. This has been a one man show Belinga Mirada. What a performance. By this jaxtr. What a phenomenal player who's been shrunk. Beautifully bold, magnificent delivery of stuff out of the ground. What a talent. I'm at a winnies turned up in white ball cricket. He has been absolutely brilliant, unorthodox, bound away and was an absolute genius. In the block. Unbelievably gifted cricket. Typical Sri Lankan cricketer fiery and unique. He made the Yorker into a thing. I know that legacy is being passed on, so I'm happy that lasted king. Think about our lesson malinger I'm not gonna say I'm sad that he went because what he left behind has been something that has made the game richer."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA,Wahab Riaz puts Australia on the back foot | CWC 15 | Bowlers Month,"An exhibition of short-pitched bowling 👏 

🎥 WATCH the over that sparked an iconic Cricket World Cup battle.","Is that unique? Batting technique moving across. The crease. We have to hurry. I don't have a direct hit there in short. I think Steven Smith assumed that was going going straight the fields, but and there was no running it until Michael Clarke called him through and called him through very very quickly. So he was. Off balance before he got going, but he's very quick. Stephen Smith. Plenty of left arm quicks in this World Cup. As you said earlier, it's trendy, well left arm pace. Get plenty of wickets. And he's gone. So the first good bouncer works for Pakistan. Australian captain Michael Clarke bounced out there 3 wickets down. Well, terrific isn't it? From Miss Barrel Hack gets his quickest man on. Gets a man in that short leg position that we identify but just a little bit deeper and that's good on the front line. So a plan that has come together for Pakistan against Australia captain. Pinpoint accuracy with the short ball and Clark can only spoon it up in the air. So big wicked for Pakistan. Clarke gone for 8:59 for three. Average is over 40. Excellent strike rate of 90 Shane Watson. Now he needs to dig deep. Build a partnership with Steven Smith and I'm just going to say that they've they've had that man for that exact dismissal, but they've they've taken him across the crease that bold full in the first bouncer with intent worked well. They've done their research, they obviously feel. As if that letter witness for Michael Clarke and they've put the man in their fold, the perfect ball and executed the plan. It's a beauty rod on the MB that follow through. This is great to see. I'll tell you what Shane Watson will not back down. This is great. This is fantastic stuff to see. 149 case on the button. Yeah, just cast your mind back a couple of hours to when Mitchell Starc was bowling at Wahab Riaz there was plenty going on and will have just giving a bit back. I don't know what was bigger that follow through or Rosie Mccrane small when he saw that ball bringing back some memories for him. So two bouncers keep backing up with good length delivery. So I play from Watson. Excellent over. And we can't train. It's 59 for three. Well, when I say here. Chat on the field. Encouragement from the bowler to himself to the recipes teammates. That's what they need Pakistan. They need someone to fire up here. Good ball and will play by Watson. Look at this look at the eyes. Come on boys."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk,Yasmin Le Bon in 110-Pound Gown at Stephane Rolland Show - Paris Couture Spring 2012 | FashionTV FTV,"http://www.FTV.com/videos PARIS - Stephane Rolland's Paris Haute Couture Week Spring/Summer 2012 runway show was inspired by the art of Michel Deverne, a French artist born in 1927 who created art and architecture out of aluminum, concrete and other materials and also guided several sculptures.  Rolland used this idea of architectural design and sculptural for her collection using fabrics like chiffon, organza, and even ostrich feathers to bridge the line between architecture and elegance. Those fabrics appeared soft while pencil skirts and waists cinched with gold circular belts were more structured.  Color combinations that typically clashed suddenly looked like they belonged together and unique tulip shapes in the waist and box shapes in the sleeves provided something architectural and different.  The beauty of it was that when models moved, a 3D effect was created in the clothes. 

By the way, Yasmin Le Bon ended the spectacular Rolland runway wearing a 110 pound silk jersey red dress with metal plates and a 147.5 foot train. She had to have two men walk with her to hold it up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQK2pvmulYM,Versace Fall Winter 2020 | Before the Show,"In the days leading up to the House’s first co-ed runway presentation, the Milanese headquarters become a space for show preparations. Chief Creative Officer Donatella Versace and her team make decisions on hem lengths, styling and accessories. Versace doesn’t care about gender, she cares about confidence. The putting together of the looks, models’ casting, the choice of music all reflect sensuality and self-confidence, freedom of expression and the sense of belonging.

“The reason I wanted to show my men’s and women’s collections together today is because men and women are equally powerful. It doesn’t have anything to do with gender, it’s that their power comes from a different type of confidence” - Donatella Versace

#VersaceFW20 #MFW",Because maybe? I went crazy. Hello. Gorgeous. Let's come out. I'd like to see this. But I have to. Yes. Happen? Larger. Stop. Kids. And then make it make the wait time. Suck. I know that. Funny. There you go. Hello. The second one. Over here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPc2ta76a_E,The Swap: Behind the Scenes with Versace and Fendi,"Here’s your exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the #VersaceFendiSwap. Donatella Versace and Kim Jones switched roles to create two collections: Versace by Fendi and Fendi by Versace. This is their journey. 

#Fendace #MFW","Yeah. I think. You know the show there. Such a vacuum Jones. This is about joy celebration and I think it's nice. It's 'cause it's really focusing on Fendi Saatchi. And that will be made with Alicia Foundation. The idea of this came around because I love Donatella and the idea of us doing something together has been talked about for a while, Kim. Yeah I would like to do something with you, but something that has never been done before. There's a lot of collaboration done, but never completely swapped the center. I I became the center of Fendi. It became the center of a century. I think this is a little more because of John. So we say all day and he looked at everything and happiness in his face and smile on his face. We all remember forever. I really looked at the archive of Versace and the things that I've grown up loving and looking at, and so there's quite a synergy between the collections. And it was kind of interesting that we both fell on the same time period without talking about it to each other. He is totally fascinated by the 90s, not by the 90s in general, but Jenny 90s. Supermodel Janice creator that really, really liked that when I saw the archives, it was seeing those clothes for the first time in real life. And just how culturally important they were, especially to my generation. It just really summed up musicians. It summed up celebrity. It summed up all these things that felt like another world. There are people who open the floor entrance. And so it was just amazing to see the detail and the finishings and the reality that they're there, because it was always an image or on TV. It was never real. That's the one I need one signed by you guys. Rules. Yeah. This is not a collaboration, meaning he wouldn't talk about what I'm doing and what he's doing. For Versace, I just took friendly and I did friendly out IC friendly. Yes, we have to meet. And then. I asked them to do things for me that I cannot do here. They do sherling which you can use it even if you don't know. First everything away was like a lace. It's incredible that kind of technique. History. The idea of doing it in like a very chic way using fendi's resources is respectful to the brand, and that's what I always think about when I work for a brand. It's always about the brand, not myself. Yes, yeah. Yeah. Hit the ball. And love them. Wow, a lot of shape. But we should do groups of five. He will have very generous person. I really appreciate friendship. And when a friend with somebody real friend, you can trust him money percent. I didn't have this feeling for such a long time. It was so you know, it was so good for me. I was so happy to find a person like that again. I respect him if work I think is one of the best, if not the best of the new generation of designer. I was very lucky for me. Yeah, exactly. Then you could share with. Embarrassed. You know how much I like you? Getting really good now. We took like a game more than a real job at that allow us to be free to express ourselves and it never happened before. So that's when the line collaboration is working. Swapping designer is a totally different thing. You trust me enough to be friendly to me. Tim enough to give her stature to him his vision. I think people will probably freak out a little bit. Be surprised question it all the usual things, but I think the end product is really fun and really nice and a really good point in time where we will be locked away and it's kind of celebrating the fact that we can get together. And one of the ways we've managed to see friends is by working with them. What I like about Kim is a big heart, you know. Also, maybe to be happy, we give each other suggestion, but more or less sign. It's interesting to see what the public reaction will be. Barbershop people love it 'cause it's like feels like the right time. Today destination the movie. See you there. You want me come take it. I could do it my love. You want me? Come take a dog. My love, my love, you want me come take my love stop Michael my love you want me you want to get a dopamine dopamine? You wanna get it? Dublin. You wanna get it? Wanna get it?"

Business Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com","I have full faith this video is going to change your life. A bad fitting pair of jeans. It's just bad, but there's good news because a lot of the time we feel like there's something wrong with our body when we put it on a piece of clothing that doesn't fit right. And we have like fat coming over the edges. We have a muffin top that's not the case. A lot of jeans just aren't suited for our body type, and I'm going to share all of the information that shows you guys that you guys are perfect the way you are. You just need to look for different tweaks and changes when you're shopping for jeans so that they flatter you in the perfect way. I'm going to share something that made it really easy for me to shop for jeans. Once you understand your shape and there are a lot of shapes, but once you have a look in the mirror and see what shape really suits you, you'll understand what jeans fit better now. Generally speaking, shapes 1/3 and four. They look really good in lower rise jeans. Someone like Eva Longoria has shape number one toss high waisted jeans out the window. This is the ideal outfit for somebody with this shape. A low rise Jean emphasizes the hip and creates all kinds of curves. Whether your top is tight or flowy, a flowy one is great 'cause it hides the waistline. And it makes you look longer. But either way, this is goals. Now these suggestions are meant to provide balance to the figure, and they don't always stand but shapes 256 and seven. They look really great in higher waisted jeans, so I steer clear personally of low rise jeans 'cause my finger is a little bit curvy and a little bit Kirby a lot curvy from the back. If I wear a low rise Jean, it's gonna draw attention to an area like a muffin top, which isn't something that actually exists when you have a muffin top. It just means your jeans are a too tight or they're too low. You might start to realize that it's all just a big illusion. Darker colors make for a slimmer appearance. Lighter colors make things look bigger, so when you look at your clothing check and see what types of things that you want for that area of your body, take a look at these pants. They have a lot, a lot going on. Remember I mentioned darker things, make things look smaller and lighter. Makes it look bigger. So even though this is a dark wash, since they've got that light strip down the center, I mean, if you're really thin and really tall, this might make you look really thin and really, really tall. But if you got anybody, I mean any extra curve will be highlighted and doubled in size just by the nature of having that light wash going down the center. Now look at where it cuts off at the knee. Anything that cuts you in half will always make you look shorter. Whether you're tall like me or whether you're already short. It's not going to flatter and elongate and create a cohesive look to your entire fashion your entire style, so that's something to keep in mind. And when you see something like a highlighted but and then the rest of the gene is really dark, you're going to notice that, like your **** is really, really obvious, which might be what you want, but it's important to understand what's happening with your clothing. Here's my deal breaker, my friends. This is one thing that I've never seen anybody mentioned before, and I don't like it. I look every single time I go to buy a pair of pants. Is there a space between the end of the zipper and the crotch? If there is like there isn't a lot of pants, it's an absolute no for me. Massive deal breaker. And This is why when I wear them because there's nothing happening there because there's no zipper. You're seeing absolutely everything you're going to get a ***** *** and every single time that you move, it's gonna catch your movements. And since the big blank space, it's very obvious and eye catching. If that's not enough, it doesn't draw the eye all the way down, and it actually makes your stomach look like it's sticking out a little bit, which isn't my favorite. This is why I like old fashioned, good old fashioned vintage jeans. They made him good back in the day and they're still available for sale on eBay and all kinds of secondhand stores now. If these jeans came all the way down in this zipper touched to the base, I would buy them. And it doesn't mean that you can't find a high waisted pair that do this because my absolute favorite pair of jeans do this perfectly. And they look amazing when the brand takes a little bit of extra time to elongate the zipper and bring it all the way down the body, it elongates the body and it also stops drawing the eye to a place like your crotch. Re really just don't want eyes naturally glaring. This is one of my favorite pairs of jeans and it actually costs twice the amount of money as the Topshop pair. But I think it's well worth it, especially considering my cost per wear. I hope you're enjoying this video so far. Give it a thumbs up if you are. There's just so much psychology when it comes to clothing and I see it all. This pair of jeans. You might think they look good. You might not. I don't really think they look that great, but let me tell you what's going on here that makes them look so different from the other pair. These pockets are not only massive, which is going to make the bum look smaller, but they're really far apart. The pockets have like at least 6 inches apart, which is going to make the bum look really big, but not in a juicy way. More in like a wide, soggy way. Usually there's a really great middle ground. So what we're going to see on this next pair of pants is that this pocket is definitely a lot smaller than the other one. In fact, this pocket is not only close together to the other one, which is going to make the hips look a little less wide, but the pockets themselves are very, very high up, and they're very small without having to try on your pants. Take a look at where your **** crease would be. Just lay the jeans flat and imagine invisible line. If you see a space between the end of the pocket and the **** crease, that's going to make your **** look really big. It's going to round it out and make it look plump, which is what a lot of people want. This also lifts the bum, which inherently will make it look large. My ideal pair of jeans are again these ones, which don't have a ridiculously large space from the crease to the end of the pocket, which lifts my **** in a really natural looking way that doesn't look too stuffy. This is a completely different wash, but this is a really great alternative to my favorite pair of jeans. These ones are from H&M and they're very affordable. These ones also lift the button really natural way. The pockets are a really great size that will make your **** look larger, but not in a way where it looks obvious. I like the way that these look. Like I feel like I kind of made my point, but let me just show you this picture I came across on Google. This is what happens when the pockets are low and there is no space from the crease of your **** to the top of the pocket. The pocket makes your **** look soggy and the **** is not even soggy. This could be the same person in both pictures, but you wouldn't know it because the jeans fit so poorly on this person. So higher waisted jeans on this body type look better. And keep in mind what I just mentioned about the pockets. This is irrelevant to the fit of your gene when purchasing. This is about the care of your jeans. Now this isn't just like I'll make your jeans last longer and hang them to dry. Well, like, I don't care, make them last a month, whatever. But if you toss these bad boys into the dryer at a high heat, you will burn through our little friend called spandex or elastane. Usually there's some type of plastic in our genes which is not a fabric. It is a plastic. And that's what's making our jeans stretchy. So even if it's like 1% like this, the minute you toss this into the dryer. You're gonna burn through it, which means when you toss your jeans on, they're going to look OK for like 5 minutes. And then they're going to go bag out on you. They're going to look really, really soggy and baggy and just avoid this by hanging your jeans to dry. You can always see if a pair of pants, the pair of jeans are going to fit you just by not holding them up because they always look bigger, don't they? When you just hold them flat, but there's a way you can put them around your neck and see if they're going to fit your waist. All you have to do is wrap them around, make sure they're buttoned up so that they're nice and taut, and then if there's any extra slack, you know that they're going to be a little bit big on the waste. If you can't get the jeans to touch around your neck, that's going to be a really, really tight fit on the waist, and you should probably size up, so those are my major. Tips like life Changing your Jean shopping is going to be a lot better. You might not even have to try them on which rocks. If you guys can leave some suggestions for your favorite pair of jeans, please also let me know what body shape you are so I know what types like what jeans I would love to have some new suggestions for jeans and I will leave all of my favorites in the description below. Alright, those are my tips. Those are the things that I think are really important when shopping for jeans. I hope that this gives you an easier time and at least gives you an understanding of what's happening when you put jeans on your body. Thank you so much for watching. And if you buy jeans after watching this video, tag me on Instagram. I would love to see your new jeans. I love you guys and I'll see you in my next video. Don't forget to check out my ASMR channel that I just launched last week. It is called scale and I know you guys are loving my first video post.

Business Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com","Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel. So you're going to be showing you do's and don'ts? Plus some hacks that I love when I'm doing my nails that make everything so much easier. So I hope you guys enjoy it and let's get started. Don't use one of these cuticle nippers. This actually creates hangnails what you need to do instead is push back your cuticles and then use a scraper to take off all of the dead skin on top of the nail. You can never see this stuff so you definitely have to scrape away at it and you'll find that there's a lot of dead skin which is probably the reason your nail Polish doesn't stay on very long. Number 2 for those of you who don't know. Oil is always on top of our skin and nails, so take a little bit of acetone or nail Polish remover and remove all of that oil with a Q-tip and make sure you don't touch your finger on top of it before you put nail Polish on. If this is how you file your nails, you might notice that your nails are constantly breaking and you're getting your nails caught on things when you go back and forth with the file, it's going to cross hatched a tiny little fibers of your nails, which is going to make them jaget even though it's not visible, it's going to be way less likely to break if you go in One Direction when you're painting your nails. Don't try to focus your eye line on getting it. Right to the edge because you will most certainly go over. Always make sure that you have less Polish on the brush as well. When you have too much Polish. Even if you keep inside the lines, it's going to pull up in the cuticle area like you can see it doing here and it's going to start drying on the edges of your nails, which is going to look really sloppy. This is my favorite method for painting my nail. I take a dot of Polish. I push it onto the upper middle area of the nail. Then I push that Polish all the way down to the very tip of my nail. And see that little space between the cuticle and the Polish. I'm going to push a little bit of that Polish up towards that area that would actually touching it to the cuticle, and then I'm going to drag it down the side and repeat on the other side. This is foolproof and it works every single time when you finish with that first coat and you see a little bit of patchiness. A lot of people go back in with some more Polish. Don't do that, wait for it to completely dry, and don't worry, there's always time for a second coat where you can take care of unevenness. You try to take care of it before it's completely dry. It's going to turn into a gloppy mess and on top of that it's never going to dry. Everybody knows a top coat is going to help your nail Polish look shinier and stay on for a really really long time. But one thing, a lot of people don't know is that taking the Polish and putting it on the edge of the nail, it's called capping. This is going to make the nail Polish stay on so much longer and I highly recommend doing it to prevent chips if you're trying out nailer and you know it's going to be messy, take some clear liquid latex and put it around the cuticle of the nail. This is the easiest way to prevent nail Polish from getting on the skin, and it looks so clean and it's really fun to peel up after you're done. I don't know how many times this happened to me, where my nails have been really dark color. Maybe like a dark red or a black. And then I go to try to take off the Polish, and there's literally no hope for my nails looking good after this, because now there's nail Polish all up in the cuticle area and the skin around it is stained red to prevent the pigment from smearing onto the skin and the cuticle. I'm going to take a really, really thick hand cream you can use any kind you want and then put this all around the cuticle area and up above the skin anywhere you think the Polish might get and then take your acetone or your nail Polish remover and press this down. Hold down the nail Polish and make sure that you remove it really, really gently. You'll see that your nail looks completely clean. And he won't even know you wore dark Polish if you're ever in a really bad situation where your nails are chipped. Of course mine looks perfectly polished right now, but a lot of the time I would have nail Polish in my bag. I would have either clear one or a colored one and I can put this on top of my nail. You didn't know? This removes Polish. Polish is the best way to get nail Polish off if you're in a pinch. I don't recommend this because you don't want to waste nail Polish on everyday basis. But if your nails look really bad and you want to clean him up, this is the perfect way to do it. Those are my hacks. I hope you guys can do it. This video. Give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed. And if you found it useful, I love you guys and I'll see you really, really soon. Bye."

Business Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com","Hey guys, with summer right around the corner and me not taking care of my bikini line this winter, I'm going to show you my treatment plan to take care of ingrown hairs, dark Marks and I'm going to talk about hair removal. This is my bikini line rehab. I hope you guys enjoy. Hair removal is always optional, but if you're watching this video, I'm assuming you're interested in removing hair. You have a couple of options in my opinion. I would stick to shaving or waxing. I don't know much about epilators, and of course laser hair removal is always an option, but that requires a ton of commitment and a lot of cash. If you've never seen my how to shave perfectly video, you can watch that and you'll see that it's really easy to learn. It's great for daily maintenance, and of course it's accessible. Which is the best. So this isn't going to be a hair removal tutorial. I'm going to talk about how to bring your bikini line from not good to good now when I shave, no matter what, even if it's a fresh blade and a fresh shave, I still get those dots around the bikini line because the hair still remains under the poor. And if it's dark and thick enough like mine, it's going to show up. But what makes everything worse is that it's itchy when it grows back, my hair is so thick. But when it pokes through the skin, it really itches and it's uncomfortable, so I had to give up shaving altogether and switch to waxing. Waxing is not just a way to remove hair, it's a way to improve the bikini line in the appearance of it, I had a really bad bikini line visual going on before I started waxing, and I've noticed a huge improvement, but I do have to mention this is not one of the areas of my body that I am comfortable waxing on my own. I advise that you never try to do your own bikini line or especially Brazilian. It will be a mess. It's just too painful to complete on your own. Professionals are really used to doing it, and it's actually a lot more comfortable going in for the service than I thought it would be. I go for a Brazilian where they remove everything between the cheeks and the front and just anything in the ***** line. This improves like my entire life because the hair comes back thinner. It lasts a really long time. I only go in every two months and in this video you guys are seeing some of the hair follicles are actually starting to grow back, so this is after a month and a half and once I see those black dots starting to form, I know that the hair is finally grown back. The great thing about waxing is it takes the hair right from the roots so it does take a long time for those. Black dots to return and eventually the hair will poke out and you can go for your next wax. The bad thing about waxing is you have to wait so your bikini line will look like this sometimes, huh? OK, now that we've talked about hair removal, let's talk about some more serious bikini line issues. I usually get ingrown hairs that look like this one on the right the most often. What you can do to prevent these is exfoliate, but if you're shaving, I do have to mention that you need to replace your blade a lot more quickly, and that's if you're experiencing razor bumps or ingrown hairs only. There's a lot of follow up and aftercare that comes with both shaving. And waxing, and that's when I want to focus on in this video. So first I'm going to talk about exfoliating. You can use either a loofah or a nice scrub that you have. I like to use a sugar scrub my friend. This really effective on the lower half and all over the body. Actually what I'm going to show you is the more effective way to exfoliate your skin. So something funny. We've all been told to exfoliate the wrong way when it comes to the bikini line, the little small circular motions that were advised to use on our face and body actually causes a lot of damage and causes ingrown hairs. So I'm going to show you something when you're exfoliating. Only go in and up and down motion. Be gentle or rough, whatever your skin likes depending on how sensitive it is, but make sure you don't go back and forth or around in a circle. This causes ingrown hairs because it confuses the hairs as they start to grow in. They don't know which direction to go, so when you're going up and down, your encouraging the hair to be able to poke through the skin, which is really important. This will definitely eliminate ingrown hairs, and it will also encourage the hair to poke through comfortably so you won't be itchy if you do shave, I recommend exfoliating 2 times a week at least. This product is awesome. It actually does what it says. This is one of those drugstore favorites of mine. It's a really unsexy bottle, but it does remove razor bumps and ingrown hairs. I just toss some of this onto a cotton pad and then I apply it fresh out of the shower to my skin and it works like a dream. I don't always remember to use it, but when I do I always see a big difference. If you shave regularly, I recommend this being one of your number one products and wait for the green product. If you're a waxer because I like that one a little bit more for daily use. Next, we're going to talk about dark spots. I get a lot of darkness in the bikini line when I don't take care of it. One of the easiest things I've noticed is to make a change in the color of my underwear. Wear a light colored underwear and make sure that it's 95% cotton. At least this is a lot more breathable and there's no harsh dyes that are going to be really dark on the skin, leaving a dark pigmentation on the bikini line. I also like seeing really comfortable lace on the edge of the ***** line because it means it's going to be more comfortable on the bikini area and it's not going to be harsh if you've just shaved. OK, here's the green product I was talking about. This one is a lot more hydrating than the one I mentioned before. I really like this. If you're a regular waxer, definitely try this one. If you need the extra power then go for the 10 skin, but this one is a lot more hydrating, which I love. What I do is I apply this fresh out of the shower just like the other one and it removes darkness around the bikini line as well as prevents ingrown hairs. So this one is like a do it all. Hydration is the number one way to eliminate dark areas as well as creating some type of exfoliation to the area so that you can give your skin the opportunity to renew. What I'm using here is a derma roller. So what I do is I roll this across my skin. It's got a ton of needles on it and they're just thin enough to not be painful, but create a little bit of abrasion on the skin. A little bit of damage, which is going to make it have to renew itself. So you're going to create a little bit of damage to that when you go to sleep. Your skin is going to regrow and when it regrows it's going to be brighter and it's going to be without the scars. So if you've got scars like I do from shaving or whatever, don't worry about it. Just make sure you don't have any active pimples that are really red and pusy. Because Dermarolling is not meant for that, I will do a video if you guys want to see how to take care of and how to use your derma roller. I'll do that next if you want. Just give this video a thumbs up like I mentioned, moisturizing is the number one way to make sure that your skin doesn't get any darkness. After removing the hair, so use something that's really gentle, preferably without fragrance. This one has a scent, but it's natural and I really like this. You can just apply this to the skin after you've removed the hair and on a daily basis, just like you would put moisturizer on your skin that concludes my bikini line rehab with all of the tips. And habits that you can start to create a better looking bikini line. It's really hard to have a perfect bikini line. Don't pressure yourself. It's just silly. We all grow hair and it's perfectly normal. I hope you guys feel really great about this video and I hope that you feel like you can take care of yourself a little bit better. If you enjoyed this video, please subscribe to my channel and give this a thumbs up. I love you and I'll see you next video."

http://youtube.com/user/approachingnirvana","OK, I'm going to begin by highlighting underneath my eyes and I like this area to be really really super bright. So I'm using a really light concealer and I'm packing this in a triangle shape. This is going to highlight your cheekbones and make your under eye area look really bright and wide awake. When it comes to highlighting and contouring, it's definitely all about customizing things for your face shape. I have a bigger forehead so I'm not going to put too much highlight because the highlighting is going to make things look bigger, so I don't want my forehead to look a lot bigger. I just want to highlight a little bit to balance out with the rest of my face. To keep the nose looking kind of natural, I'm going to put a little bit of highlight on the bridge and then a little bit of highlight just on the tip. This is going to make your nose look slender and pointy. When I go to blend out my contour, I want a lighter shade to be able to mix it with and make it look like a nice gradient effect. So I'm taking this lighter color and I'm putting this underneath my jaws and beside my milk to brighten things up. OK, we're going to move on to contouring and you don't need any special products for this. Just pick a foundation or concealer that's at least three or 4 shades darker than your face. I'm mapping out my chin and contouring around it, as well as my jawline, and this is going to make my face appear more defined and my chin more pointy. If you have a small forehead, don't add very much contour to your face because that's going to make it look even smaller. You can always add more highlight and that's going to make it appear bigger for me. I have a bigger forehead so I add a lot of contour and I balance it out that way and don't worry if it looks messy right now you don't have to apply your contour and highlight perfectly. You can do it really mostly as long as you're putting it in the right places and blending it out properly. Now that we have everything mapped out on our face, it's time to start blending. I'm going to use two tools for this because I want to keep my highlight really bright and I want my contour to stay dark. I don't want things mixing together and getting muddy. To blend out all of the highlighting, I'm going to use a purple beauty blending sponge in this is really soft and easy to work with. I like using this for the highlight and just pushing it into the skin. Don't use any sweeping motions because you're going to move the product around and you want everything to stay exactly where you put it. Because I'm using such a bright highlight and such a dark contour, that middle color is really perfect for my skin tone and that gradient is really what's going to make the look more natural. This is all about blending and even though it might seem a little bit messy and it might seem like things aren't coming together perfectly, just keep blending and keep blending. And if you need to add more product, go ahead and do that until you like what you see. Now we have everything blended out. I'm going to take one of my favorite products right now. This is my honest ascea contour kit and it has contour and highlight patterns in it, so you could really set your makeup and not disturb the color that you put down. I'm using the bronzers to set the perimeter of my face and then I'm pressing in with a sponge. The highlight color and that's just going to set everything. Make sure it stays in place all day. And now your makeup is set in place. It's going to last all day and all night, so this is a really good step. And it's awesome if you're going to be doing this before you go out, let me know if you guys can tour on a regular basis for me, I'd like to do this on the weekends and when I'm going out, it looks amazing in photos and it's definitely time consuming, but totally worth it. I really hope that you enjoyed watching this video. Please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel. I look forward to seeing you guys on Monday. And until then, have a great week.

Business Inquiries: alexandrasgirlytalk@gmail.com","Listen when I was younger I used to think that being sexy was like showing skin and every time I wanted to look hot I would try to dress myself in a way that would like show as much as possible. This resulted in me wearing these really strange thin stretchy dresses that were clearly not designed for a woman's body and no matter what the event, rain or shine I was in one of these, there's always a guy who thought that was really great, but I was super uncomfortable. You guys. I was like literally so uncomfortable in my own skin in these dresses and that meant I couldn't be myself. I couldn't actually have fun. Which really sucks and I don't want to feel like that, and I don't want you guys feel like that either. So today I'm going to show you the art of sexy. We're gonna go over things like color, texture and silhouette to add sexiness to any outfit, no matter how modest it is. If you guys want to see this, continue into a series then give this a thumbs up and also please subscribe to this channel if you haven't. Let's get into the video so you guys know how I used to dress when I want to look hot that's actually changed a lot and I realized sexy isn't something you can like put on your body. It's not a piece of clothing, it's a feeling inside of you. It's a confidence and a reassurance that you love yourself and that you love others and it just can't help but like overflow and make you attractive. But if you have a negative vibe you can't perceive yourself as attractive and neither can anyone else. So don't forget to smile. I know we all have bad days but use dressing yourself and getting yourself ready as a form of self care. That should raise your vibration by the time you're done OK when you actually start shopping for pieces that are sexy without actually showing much skin, take some hints from lingerie. We can learn a lot from the drapey, silky softness. The lace. Then stretch and all of the things that make lingerie really appealing to the eye texture is huge. And with lingerie we see a lot of that, so finding tops and pieces that flow with your own natural rhythm will make you appear more sexy when you're moving about. You can take a little camisole like this and throw a blazer over it with some jeans and all of a sudden your outfit is way hotter and don't be afraid to find a really unexpected color done in a sexy fabric. That's a really cool combination and it's great for daytime. There is an element of lingerie that you can actually wear outside in an outfit, and it's very, very attractive. I love this because it also keeps you warm. You can wear a stocking with a dress or a skirt. I love something that has a little design like these stay ups. They've got a line down the back which is going to enhance the leg and make the I follow the line which is really, really elongating and beautiful now. Texture is just the beginning of dressing yourself sexy, but once you start to look at the lingerie sets you'll realize that those delicate intricacies can be found in some really simple. Items like a top or a skirt, and once you add these pieces to an outfit, you'll find that you feel and look a lot sexier. Color has a powerful impact on the mind, so it's really smart to pay attention to it when you're picking your clothing pieces, regardless of what the clothing actually looks like. Sometimes you can take something that would be otherwise really innocent, like the color white. This is a basic white shirt. That's a really, really simple, but adding an element in the beauty department that is really sexually charged like a just bitten red lip. Dabbing this onto the center of the lip is going to make it look really sexy. Which is kind of a cool contrast to an otherwise conservative outfit. In fact, when it comes to red, it's the most powerfully sexy color. If you throw this on, it will have you feeling so confident you can do it in a way that is neutral and subdued like this cute kitten heel. But if you really want to command a lot of attention, go for a larger piece of clothing and choose a fire engine. Red like these cool red pants. These aren't leather, but they kind of have that slick look as though they are. They're a waxed coated denim wax coated denim comes in all colors, but this is one of those fantastic ways to make the thighs in the bum look. Really great continuing on with color theory. I've got another cool pair of wax coated denim. These ones are black and black is one of those colors that the minute I put it on. I feel like I look slimmer. I feel more mysterious and sexy covering your body and all. Black fitted clothing will make you feel both subdued and intense all at the same time. But you've got a lot of options you don't always have to go for dark, rich, mysterious colors. Picking something that is delicate and feminine is a really great choice if you want to appear more sexy. If you're dressing with a bear leg, one of the greatest little things you can do is put on a nude shoe to elongate your legs. This is a great trick. For girls who are shorter and want to appear much taller, I don't usually show cleavage, but sometimes I'll go for a deep, plunging neckline, and when I do, I always remember to keep my undergarments mysterious. You never want to see straps or bras or underwear lines. All of these things are really key for maintaining mystery and also looking really put together. Thumbs up if you guys want to see a video on how to dress underneath your clothes. OK, so we've all worn leggings before. In fact, I think that leggings are actually something we should all transition out of wearing entirely as we hit our 20s. It's really easy to look frumpy in these, and they're also too revealing, but we can capture that same sexy silhouette that you get from a legging with a tailored fitted slack. It essentially looks like the same thing, but these ones will slim you with a nice fitted material that is both thick and giving you lots of coverage, and they can be dressed up or down. I brought up the legging thing because I think silhouette is really key and people usually think fitted equals sexy, which isn't always the case. Play with oversized clothing and capture areas of the body that are feminine and sensual like the waistline for this look. I'm using a skirt that gives me a little muffin top which is. Actually, perfect in this situation with an oversized sweater, it's a great way to really highlight the waistline and make it look even smaller than it actually is, which gives you a very sexy silhouette. I could probably do an entire video on outerwear because it's really interesting to see the psychology of how it fits and how it affects your look, but combining a soft feminine shade like this pink color with a silhouette that is fitted and cute will make you look pretty before you even take your jacket off, so I hope you guys learn something from this video about color, texture and silhouette. And how do you use this to look sexier? Comment below if you have any other tips and I'll see you in my next video. Bye bye."

Business Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com","This video is a it's a game changer folks. A real game changer. I personally like to look put together. I like to look like I put thought into my outfits even when I didn't and I really like to look luxurious and expensive. And today I'm going to show you how you can achieve that. I think a lot of people think it means just buying like a Gucci belt and tossing it over a pair of jeans. I don't think that buying a designer item makes you look expensive. I think there's a lot more to it and today we're going to go over. All of the ways you can achieve that. I hope you guys enjoy the video. Give it a thumbs up before we get started. OK, let's get right into it with a little bit of awareness and mental preparation, we can eliminate things like decision fatigue from the Everyday Act of getting dressed and not knowing what to wear. And as a result not looking great. I think looking expensive is really achievable no matter what your budget. Given that you prepare properly. Let's talk about fast fashion. Fast fashion is based around nothing more than the psychological pain that consumer will experience when. Looking at a price tag and seeing a high price point. So what they do is they make the price points really really low at the expense of both quality and style. The idea that buying fast fashion is going to save you money is a complete lie and the biggest problem with it is that it makes it really hard for you to develop a personal sense of style since styles are always changing and this means that you're going to be buying a lot more a lot more frequently than you would if you were to be investing in high quality pieces. OK, let's do a little lesson. A little lesson in ourselves or. Like fashion in our lives, divide up this circle with all of the different ways that you spend an average day. We're going to identify. Here is, how do you actually spend your time? I spend a lot of time working, which means I'm maybe not wearing pants. I'm wearing loungewear, which means that I actually should spend a little bit more on my loungewear and make sure that it's good quality and it can stand the test of time since I'll be wearing it so often. This is super personal to each and every person and that's why doing that chart is really effective. Things like trend pieces and special event bags or dresses. For me, they don't make a lot of sense to invest in because I don't attend a lot of special events and I'm definitely not going to wear green shoes everyday. This is the explanation of cost per wear. Basically, this is the cost of an item divided by the amount of times that you wear it and when you start looking at the pieces you invest in, whether they cost a lot or a little, you'll start looking at how often you're going to wear it and that can help you justify the price and eventually start to own things that are higher quality and much more desirable. For example, I've started to buy designer jeans. These are in the two to $300 price range, which. Always seemed really insane, but I used to spend about 70 to $100 on a pair of top top jeans that I really didn't love. And since I switched to the capsule wardrobe mentality, I started spending more on each piece, but I have less items in my closet by a lot and each item lasts me for years. So coming back to this chart, I'm also going to take a look at what colors I feel great in what colors make me feel beautiful. And of course I also like to take a look at the hardware I enjoy. I wear gold hardware because my skin is olive and it has green undertones, so that's what's going to make me glow. But if you have pink undertones, you're going to notice that silver is your best friend or white gold now, even if you don't have the budget to go shopping today, it's OK. We can have an awareness of what types of pieces would be really smart investments to add to our wardrobe, and that can really help you build confidence when shopping. Now this is pure gold. Monochromatic is a lifestyle. This is a really good thing to do and to know how to do to bring all one shade into an outfit or stick to strictly one color and one color only. This makes you look really expensive and put together and it becomes really easy and practical to do if you really enjoy one color like black or all grey like me in a moment where I'd be wearing sweats, I will make sure that they match top and bottom. This does two things. It makes you look very cohesive. It makes your style look seamless and put together. Even though you're in sweatpants. Of course, it's easy to look good when you plan to, but when you don't plan to and you're going to go throw on sweats, this is when monochromatic dressing is a really great way to elevate your style and make you look expensive in a moment where you would probably look your worst. If I may. This is a real game changer because you might not have paid attention to this before I mentioned it and then you will never stop noticing it. Now that I've said it. This is hardware. Hardware can be found on jeans. It can be found on handbags. You'll see it on the backs of shoes and the zippers. Also on jewelry. Of course. The idea is to use your jewelry as a baseline and then make every other piece of hardware match in your bag and in your shoes and any other jacket or accessory should also have a similar or exact hardware. This will make you look very, very elegant and put together in a very subtle way that not everybody will notice, but you certainly will, and people around you won't. Exactly be able to put their finger on why you look so good. You'll notice that you have buying habits and wearing habits, and when you go to add new pieces to your wardrobe or to your jewelry, you know what to look for. If you always wear gold then a bag with gold hardware could be really great investment and vice versa with silver. I think I've seen a lot of mixed metals lately and I really like this. As long as you have a piece that can bring both silver and gold into your outfit. Now you notice how all of these are structural ideas for how you can look more expensive that don't actually involve like a certain piece of clothing or a designer item or anything like that. This is my next point. I think it's really important. These kind of underwear we all remember wearing these when we were younger, and now that we are women they don't look that great. Don't look the same. They're not made for a woman's body and putting this kind of underwear underneath dresses or fitted pants and this is going to completely diminish your feminine charm. So the solution for this is to wear shapewear. There are many different types of shapewear like a tank top that smooths out your waist and makes you look thinner, or a pair of Spanx which are. Kind of like shorts that will make your body look very, very slim and slender through the thigh and waist to get the most extreme results, you need a core set. This is a waist trainer and this will really shape your body and give you lots of curves. This wardrobe of shapewear has taken me some time to invest in and everybody, no matter your age or your body type. You can benefit from shape or in some way. It's just finding the right pieces for you so always try your stuff on and see what it does to your body and if you like it a lot of the time you'll realize your waist will be like three times smaller. Instantly, I love shapewear because it can make you look so hot right away for a beginner. If you want to get started with smooth undergarments, I highly recommend investing in lace thongs. These are extremely affordable because they're not marketed as shapewear, but they have that effect. They are really, really smooth underneath their clothing, and now you don't have ***** lines, which is exactly the way it should be. Nobody should know what's happening underneath their clothing, and I love that the clothes you already own can look that much better with the correct undergarments. This one might seem the most simple, but it's like super overlooked. This is basic care for your items, making sure there's no lint, but most importantly no wrinkles. Wrinkles are the thing that is like a dead giveaway and you might think it doesn't matter, but it like definitely is noticeable to everybody. I love my steamer. Actually, I love this and my deep hill. Are you guys know I use this on sweaters and leggings and like anything that would get pilled. And I steam things when I know they are prone to wrinkles and it makes a huge difference. In the way my outfit looks every single time. So there you go. Those are my tips on how to look more expensive or at least a starting point for some of my tips. I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

Business Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com","This might sound weird to say, but at this point in my life a man is like a desert like share set a man is like a desert. It's delicious but not necessary. I'm finally at a point where I'm focusing on my career and my personal growth and I'm just do anything. I'm just gonna put my Barbie on my Barbie. Carrianna on on such a high above that meeting that was like really, really really good. I am working on myself a lot and a man is like a fun extra. So I have a lot of tips when it comes to dating because I want to do it right or not do it at all. To enjoy dating you have to have the right foundations and we're going to cover those today. You can expect from this video tips to improve your confidence in your perception of the situation, but also some practical beauty elements that might make you feel a lot better when you're on your date. This is a really huge mistake. Mistake number one is canceling your day. Let's think we got a plan in place. We got a cute guy, someone we might like, someone we might be with. I mean it's so exciting, especially when you have something planned to look forward to, not just somebody you're talking to. You actually have a date. And historically I've used this as a time to pamper myself and take like a three hour, maybe 4 getting ready process. And I would like be way less productive during the day because I was just daydreaming and anticipating. But when you really think about this? If you were to prepare in this way for every single date you ever went on when you really think about it, you're internalizing an expectation of who this man or woman or boy or girl is, and that could be problematic if the person isn't good for you. So what I realized is you can save these getting ready rituals these day, canceling getting ready processes for somebody who really deserves it. Who's shown you authenticity, respect, and emotional intimacy. And if you're going on the first day, I recommend not wearing something sexy. I used to think. Dating men wearing something sexy and I don't think that this telegraphs what I really want. I want to get to know somebody else, and ultimately I want them to see me for who I really am, and I think if I show a lot of cleavage or wear something revealing it might distract from that person, seeing who I really am. Here's how I look at it. You are going to weed out the people who only want you for your body and you're gonna feel more empowered because you get the chance to wear something comfortable and modest because you deserve to dress that way if you want. Self esteem is either rising based on action or coming crashing down based on the things you're doing and wearing. And if you're wearing something that you attach yourself worth to, it can be so much easier for you to feel unloved if you're not well received by your date and your date realistically is only going to be for you if they truly see and like who you are as a person. I love getting dressed so it's weird for me to say but don't let clothing get in the way. Circling back to what's comfortable and modest might help you achieve more boundaries for yourself. And also feel really comfy and cozy on your date. But if you want to look sexy, go off. You always have the prerogative and it's kind of fun sometimes thumbs up if you're enjoying. Mistake #2 buying new clothes. First things first, everybody wants to get dressed look cute, go on their date and feel their best. But when you make these plans and you start to think about what you want to wear, I highly recommend you don't buy a new top. This is like what I would always do in the in the past. I would always get a new shirt. It was like I had to wear a new shirt like if I was going out. I just like had to wear a new one. Where does that come from? I don't know but The thing is I've realized overtime purchasing this new shirt was nothing about actually wanting a new top. It was more so about the fact that. I didn't feel worthy in like my own skin and I thought I needed something new or like something different to make myself desirable and this is like super not true. Not only is this not true, but you don't want to communicate these expectations for yourself that like you need to present differently than who you really are. And that's why I've started to do this. Like one simple trick, which is where something you already own. Don't try to address too conservative. Don't try to dress too sexy. You won't be comfortable. Dress as a reflection of who you are that day. Here's a little theoretical story for you. This is Jack. Jack is a really funny guy. In fact, he's a really good listener and he's really nice and we're going on a date to good people on a date. Why not? I'm going to be telling him all about who I am since we don't know each other very well. And as I'm doing this, I want to remind myself to speak with confidence. Now when you're on a date, you're expressing yourself through your words. You're sharing your thoughts and opinions. And as you're doing this, it's really important to remove those little phrases. Those little phrases I've heard. All women use at some point or another where we say how we feel about something and then we go. But I don't know or if that makes any sense. I want you to trust that when you speak and express yourself, it can be understood by people because you're smart. Honestly, when I realized that my whole life changed, OK creeping is something I know every single one of you do this. Like we all creep people, we find a new guy. We tell our friends about him we like, try to find him online. Whatever. I don't know, maybe just me. For me, the temptation is very strong to like. Go into somebody's Instagram or their Facebook and see what is the T. I'm not talking about making sure this person is real and not an axe murderer. I'm talking about diving deep into likes and comments and photos. However, looking deep into someone's personal life based off. Other Instagram account checking how many followers they have, what their comments say and all of the other little things about somebody. Social media eliminates the chance for you to organically get to know somebody. There's also a scientific reason why you shouldn't do this. The reticular activating system is a small area of the brain thumbs up so I can get better animation. This is sad, but there is a small part of the brain that helps you recognize something again and again. Once you've noticed it for the first time, let me tell you more about this as you gather more information about this person, you're going to start to tell yourself who this person is. You might see a photo of the guy with a child and think oh he loves kids, but in actuality that might just be a photo. This comes down to letting other people show you who they are and showing other people who you are. This is the true way to receive love. Now it's time for the big one. Hiding yourself in any way shape or form. And this started with make up for me. I used to wear a lot of makeup to like physically try and like cover up and change. I mean I even wore blue contacts at one point I was always trying to like change my appearance to be somebody else. I have learned so much. It's not about judging myself for wearing a lot of makeup. It's not about saying that less makeup is better. I still love heavy eye makeup, and I still love heavy glam. I mean, it's it's coming from a different place now, and I'm not always going to be in it for a date. I might want to show more of my features in a lighter brown eye shadow look when I created a vision for who I was and what I wanted to show the world, I started making all of my beauty decisions match that and I've gained so much confidence from doing this. And it's not always easy. Sometimes I feel like a guy doesn't like me for some silly little reason and my coach told me, well, the reason you feel that way is 'cause you know. You've had a lot of bad things happen to you precious one. You would be hard not to like you. You're beautiful. But more importantly than that, you're wonderful. You're smart, you're kind, you're compassionate, your, your patient. You're good. You're forgiving your loyal. There's nothing not to like. Something tells me I'm not the only girl who is incredible and amazing and I see so often the most beautiful, wonderful women who are struggling like I was because I don't have boundaries because I didn't have self confidence and that's what this video. Was all about. I hope that you guys enjoyed it. Three things I want you to give this a thumbs up if you want me to turn this into a series. OK, so smash that like button number two I love you and #3. Thank you Jack for being my model. I'm going to link his YouTube channel below. Thank you Maxine for helping me fill this and of course James. And then I want to get you a big smile from you Ali. It looks like you're thinking to yourself like what if we get married? Did your phone die? I'll see you in my next video. In the meantime, follow me on Instagram, bye."

Business Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com","Hey you guys welcome to my kitchen. Welcome to my home. I'm going to be doing a fun video with you guys tonight because it's late at night and I just made an amazing purchase. Well I hope it's amazing and I wanted to unbox it with you guys and I'm just very impatient so I'm ready to do this because I can't wait until the morning. I hope you guys enjoy this in boxing and if you do please give it a thumbs up. All of my purchasing is going in line with my diet which is plant based and vegan. So as I'm moving along I'm looking into. What kind of luxury bags I can buy that are completely animal free? I'm hoping that they become more readily available on the market. This was not easy to find and it's not cheap even though it is not leather. This bag retails for over $2000, although I did get it pre loved the person who had owned it before me. They wore it maybe five times so it should be an excellent condition, but the trick is I haven't actually looked at this bag before so. I bought it without looking at it. OK, so without further ado, this bag is by Jeevan. She thank you Jean. She for doing this bag in a non leather version and for those of you who have a problem with purchasing from a brand that is, you know killing animals the way that I'm looking at things right now is that I'm looking to support brands who are trying to or even just kind of dabbling into making an effort towards things that aren't killing animals so. Even when I shop with brands that like have some non vegan products, I don't really mind. I want to support everybody to change and grow because that's what I did. I wasn't always vegan so I think I'm going to assume you guys out a little bit that's in OK. Oh my gosh, this is so. It's so beautiful. Oh my God. Holy **** this is so nice I didn't expect it to be so beautiful. It feels so smooth. This is the matte version, so of course since it's not leather, it's made out of something that they call like rubberized effect. So I'm not sure if it's like rubber. It feels like rubber feels kind of like a bouncy ball. I'm going to be using this bag a lot. I just fell in love like I didn't realize how beautiful this is going to be. I didn't expect to love it so much. I was expecting this to be a big bag, but I'm thinking it might be a really beautiful size. So let's go see. I'm going to stand against the wall. OK, so for those of you who don't know, I'm 5. 8 And this is a great size, I think, for my body type, I think that this is like oversized still, but I don't know. I think it looks good on my stature and I really like that this is a convenient strap. A lot of people have said that it's really uncomfortable, but to me this is a perfect size. It's made of polyester, polyurethane and Poly vinyl, so this is a mix and they call it the rubber effect. Rubber is very durable so this is an extremely durable bag. I can tell already just from the little scratch test I've done. You're going to have this back for years and years and years, and you're always going to have it looking absolutely stunning. Like you just bought it, so that in itself is completely worth it to me. I'm really happy I waited and I didn't look at this bag before I unboxed it on camera because this is stunning. This is seriously one of the most gorgeous bags that I've seen, and it's definitely the most gorgeous bag that I own. Knowing that there is no animal on this like that makes me so happy. I really encourage you guys to try vegan leather and vegan materials. Because they are so beautiful. I hope you guys enjoyed this video and let me know what you think of it in the comments below, I'll see you soon bye."

Ashley Tisdale's Guide to Mood-Boosting Skin Care and Makeup | Beauty Secrets | Vogue","Hey guys it's Ashley Tisdale and I'm gonna walk you through my everyday skin care routine and my glowy Dewey all natural makeup routine, alright let's get started. This is my ultimate face wash it's so good it is Joanna Vargas vitamin C at face wash. Rough things I've learned is that when I go to my dermatologist or get a facial. They really take the time to wash her face. I'm someone who at the end of the day can be like oh I just wanna get this awful fast. But it's so important to really take the time and you get like a little massage in there. It feels good. I take these they're fresh pads. I use these when I'm having breakouts. I don't use them all the time and I do have a little bit of break out I have on my periods. That's probably why I just take a pad. The hydronic acid boosting serum by PC skin so just take 2 pumps of that and I'm still wet, so I am not fully dry. That's important to know. I've always taken good care of my skin since I was young. I think I've learned from my grandma to be honest. She's someone who takes care of her skin all the time still today, and so I just have always really cared about caring about it. OK, so now I'm going to use the hydrolocks intensive hydration, something that I've always done is that I spend a lot more money on my skin care than my makeup. It's just. If you're going to spend money spend on your skin care 'cause that is where you have to take care of it the most. I'm going to take my nurse Jamie Roller and just this look. What it does is it uplifts and it up lifts my spirit that's for sure. It makes me feel so good. I also suffer from TMJ so this was like a massage for that. Thank you like we like this to really important is the. I have not always worn sunscreen. I've gotten older. It's become more important to me. I do this morning and night. The Fortuna skin I've used so many different eye creams since I was like in my 20s and. I started earlier 'cause like you know, why not for preventative reasons and this has to be like the best one. I'm not kidding you. Self care is super important to me and skin care is a part of that. I'm very open about how I have struggled with mental health and so I can have anxiety tick up being home for this long and then obviously having a baby like my life has changed a lot just like everyone else is. I have created a lot of rituals for myself that really helped ground me. It's like opening up a window, lighting a candle, putting a bath, and you know putting a hair mask in and it's just like it makes me feel like. So good, so now let's get into my makeup routine. I'm going to take this. Its merit basically is a complexion foundation. I was kind of like put it on like this. And I take this Fenty foundation brush, which is it's so soft. When I used to go to events, I would obviously use a heavier foundation, but because I'm home a lot. I just there's just no reason to be putting all that on. I look at living at cleaner lifestyle as a lifestyle, not a diet, and sometimes like you know, if you're on a diet or like bound to go back to the other stuff. So I really just try to incorporate products that I really love that are clean, but I am OK with also using stuff that I was just like I cannot find a replacement for you, so it is just kind of a balanced. Little lifestyle. I like learning from people I work with. I also because of dealing with anxiety. A lot of the time when I was going to events I would get very anxious. People think that it's like very glamorous to just have hair and makeup and like have everybody over and you get your hair and makeup done. Probably feels like prom or something like every single night that you're going to an event. I learned when I would do my makeup myself for an event here. It's like I'll always use someone to help me with my hair, but I'll do my own. Pick up and it makes me feel like participating in some way and I learn a lot like years ago on YouTube. So that is where I learned all of my secrets. I think there's memes of all the red carpet stuff that I'm like. Oh my gosh, what was I doing? You know what? It was such a good time. At the same time like I really could care less that people thought about me and I think that's like such a beautiful thing. Now I care too much about what people think. I didn't do my mega back then. Those were not lying. Make up choices. Next is. A rose ink concealer and 50 people love to Instagram me. Some old throwbacks of my style. And it is hilarious honestly. Definitely being a mom has changed my beauty routine because I just don't got time to do stuff. It's become definitely quicker for sure. Now I'm going to take my all time favorite Chanel bronzer. I like this 'cause this is shaped for the contour. And then it's just really about blending. Laura Mercier, another classic all time favorite powder underneath my eyes. Kind of like where I feel the most shiny. I am going to just take this Charlotte Tilbury. Just I'm using the end of it. I get my eyebrows laminated so I really don't have to do much to them. Although there is like a little space right there, so I'll fix that. This is my all time biggest secret ever. I have used this for so long. I always make sure to bring this. It's Bobbi Brown. It's the bronzing powder and what I do. I kind of just like go over my whole face so it just I don't know there's something about it that kind of gives me that like like little level up glow. And then there's this. I learned this from. Vogue, I think this was Hillary. This is kind of like where my makeup has completely changed since being mom and in the pandemic. I really just take this Bobbi Brown. I take my brush. And then I just take this little brush. And do the bottom. This is Fenty, beauty. I take it with my finger. I just put it on the lid so it kind of gives it a little bit of a shimmer. Said the scariest part. I have been pinched with one of these things, so I think I just have PTSD. When I'm on said I 100% do my mascara and if I'm going to like do lashes for sure. Oh and this is kocis which is the best mascara and it's clean which is awesome. There's too much pressure and stress to kind of like dive into like a very like non toxic lifestyle and it's a very expensive. I love that actually we're living in a time where there are clean products that have great color. You know, like there I think at one point I remember like back in the day it was just like hardly able to cover and I was like there's got to be like you know something. So I was not in love with clean products you know. Obviously like 15 years ago but now I feel like we're at a great place I'm going to. On my cheek, which is. Giorgio Armani and it's a blush this is amazing, so I just like dot this on and this is something that I saw in makeup. Tip by Selena who got it from her makeup artist is to go up and then I use like blend and like really blended in. One of the products that I will keep in my bag to reapply is obviously lipstick, so this is Charlotte Tilbury and it's pillowtalk, and it's by far like my favorite lip. I also just do one last thing, which is a secret I have been developing something with Frenchy and it's my last thing that I put on and I put it on my hands. Very good and last but not least, this perfume is the best just because smells different on everyone. Alright guys, I am ready to go have a fun day of work and being with my baby so thank you so much for watching my skin care and makeup routine and thank you so much vogue."

Bella Poarch's Signature TikTok Makeup Routine | Beauty Secrets | Vogue","Hey guys it's Bella Poarch today. I'll be showing you guys how I do my skin care routine and how I do my classic boa look. My first step is cleanser. My next step is to put vitamin C on my face. I feel like vitamin C is so important. And then I use the touch a moisturizer. This is my favorite. It doesn't really leave my skin oily. SPF sunscreen is so important too. And throughout the day, keep applying. Growing up in the Philippines, my mom didn't really give me any skin care tips. I have like ants and like aunties that would tell me like, oh, you'd like some screen. Now that I'm done with my skin carotene. My first step for my makeup is foundation. I use this by Murphy. I just take like a like 1 pump. It's been like a crazy year for me. I I downloaded. Tick tock. Last year, around January for fun, because my friends were like recommending it. I grew up with and watching anime. The girls in the anime they have like really like rosy cheeks and that's how I got inspired to do like my. Rosy pink cheeks on tick tock. Whenever I wear out in public, people would ask me is your face where or did you get like sunburn? And I'm like no it's makeup but I think it's really cute. When I did the entered the Bay Video flash here and it was like that IK my tick tock that went viral. I woke up the next day and I had like a million legs. I was still in shock 'cause I was like Oh my gosh that's that's a lot of likes. My next step is concealer. I use Nars concealer. Just put it under like. Under my eyes, just a little bit just like that. My next step is my eyebrows is I use benefit? The difference between like Philippine may grow up and be less makeup is that Philippines? They don't really like foundation or like really thick makeup and I noticed they like to put like the middle part of your lips like make it like reddish pink. That's basically like the the look growing up. I didn't really. I wasn't allowed to wear makeup in school so like all my friends have like lipstick on and they have like eyeliner and. I wasn't allowed to. So I was always jealous. OK, so the next step is I use this browser by Charlotte Tilbury. I really like it. Been using it for a while now. First I start off with like. My cheeks. I like to like. Contour my nose. I just use like my finger. It matches my skin pretty well. That's all it was when I do for the contour and the broader next, I'm going to do my lips and I get this phone Charlotte Tilbury and it's pillowtalk. It's like one of my favorite lip liners. So if you could see my upper lip is like darker than my bottom lip, my Filipino friends have like the same and they always hated it. They're like. How do I get like just pink upper lip? 'cause it's like a Filipino thing. I guess. I feel like you just gotta embrace like where you're from. And I came to the United States when I was like 14 and I got bullied a lot. And yeah, so many bad experiences I went through. In high school, just because of what I look like, I feel like it still happens a lot and it needs to be like talked about more because. It's not OK to like bully people because of where they came from or what they look like. Even if after I graduated high school I still had like my high school bullies just bullying me on my Instagram post. I feel proud of myself for. Just believing it myself and getting this far in my life. My next step is lipstick and this is my favorite from Gucci. I couldn't afford this, probably like. A year ago, I'm just so grateful now that I can afford this face like things and. I'm very grateful I want to make everyone. Specialist Philippines like that's my home. Now we have. Blush a lot of people ask me what I use and how I do my. My classic MTV below sunburn. Look that Rick tool it is you put it not so close to like you're under like under your eyes and make it look like you just got sober. A lot of people use makeup brushes for like their entire face. I feel like sometimes it's good to use like your your fingers 'cause. You can control how much you put in it and then you can make it look. Natural to make it look so much better. Don't forget to like put concealer just so it can lighten up in this part. Just put a little bit on top of like your nose bridge and then exaggerate. More put more in these areas. Next step highlighter you notice like in my empathy video my face is kind of like Chloe and like very shiny is because of the highlighter. First I put it on my finger and then I put it on. It took awhile. And then you put it on your chin to make it look shiny cute. For a little bit on the cheap. Now you guys know how to do it. I use this for like my eye makeup and everything. This is literally the only brush, and so I just. Put some like right here. So now last thing I'm gonna brush out my eyelash extensions. So this is what I use for my hair and you can like control the temperature and I don't want to go too hot 'cause I have like really thin hair. In the military. I have to do my hair every morning and I have to put it in a bun and I can do it in like 2 minutes. If it doesn't look perfect then. My my petty officers would just tell me. Bring to you here I want to do the military also taught me how to be like a professional. Everything has to be perfect. And after I strain my hair, I just like grab the two strands. This is the. Look thank you guys so much for watching."

Every Outfit Hailey Bieber Wears in a Week | 7 Days, 7 Looks | Vogue","Hi Vogue, it's Hayley Bieber today. I'm going to be showing you guys what I wear in a week. OK, so this is my cozy, comfy athleisure look. This is definitely something I would love to fly in or maybe for even a long road trip to start. I wouldn't be in hotel slippers so I'm going to take these Nike SB's hold those up like that. 'cause I just think it looks cooler and then. I'm going to put it with this cool like charcoal Gray coat that is from la Mer. I love a really long sleeve on a coat. It's everything to me. I love this sweatshirt because it's like a little bit worn and it's vintage. But it is that yummy fleece on the inside. So this look for me is more of a like a New York style look when it starts to get chilly there bye love these marshmallow pants. I've had them for a long time. I love the way that they fit. This is a very cozy cashmere Bottega Veneta sweater so I feel like I'm going to be able to have this sweater for 20 years and it's never going to go out of style and my kids can steal it from me. One day I used to steal a lot of sweaters from my mom when I was younger. She had like this amazing cashmere sweater collection. I'm going to do this really cool Red Saint Laurent coat. Me trying to get things off the rack without knocking million things over so I am obsessed with this coat. It's going to be my coat of the season I'm going to go with these Alexander Wang Heeled booties. Please excuse me while I try to get these on, but you wanted to see how I really get myself dressed, so this would be what it's like 1. It didn't rip, it. Did it rip? It's just the sound of the pants. That's the one thing about this material is. It's a little bit loud, especially if you like sit down in them or sit on like a leather seat and you're just like it's just the pants. I swear and I'm going to pair it with. This YSL bag I love this necklace in general. I'm just not sure if I want it with this outfit. I think I like it with this for sure. When I was buying this coat and I decided to go up two sizes just to first of all feel cozy. But second of all, when you're trying to put sweaters and more bulkier things underneath them just so you have more room to do that, so bad coat necklace. Good to go. So this is my kind of day to night look and these pants are my like favorite thing of the season. Right now they're by the brand Kate, which I really, really love. I just love the way that they fit. I love the length of them. I love the little split at the side so you can wear them with a flat shoe and they're flattering. Or you could wear them with a heel and they're super flattering. This little bralette. I also really love. It's by Jack moose. Simon, don't kill me. Mispronounced it. I wear a lot of Blazers. I think Blazers are an essential part of anybody's wardrobe. At least a really good staple black woman or Gray one or neutral colored one from Magda Bertram. This one you can see kind of comes in at the waist. Cinches here is a little bit more flattering. I'm going to pair it with these white Tom Ford heels. I love that they're a little pop of white. I think it's super cute. I think I would go with. Probably this white jock moose so it's like pop of white and pop of white together. Throw it over my shoulder. I feel very like business chic in this outfit. Feels very like mature but cool. I love it and call it a day tonight. So this is my date night look and I went with a cute little black dress that's usually my favorite. Go to for any type of going out or date night situation. I love heels that have straps like that that go around the ankle. I think it's really sexy. Let's say it was maybe chilly in the evening. I would pair this with this Marina Moscone one. It actually hits a very similar length to the dress. And I think it brings a cool little edge to the outfit. And since it's an all black outfit, I like a little pop of color with it. I think it's always fun to get dressed up for date night and even just get dressed up for each other and nobody else. I wouldn't say husband is too overly picky about anything I wear. I think he just feels like if I feel good in it then he likes it too. So this is a wack wolford bodysuit and a pair of blue jeans. I'm gonna start with this Zara belt. But you never seen someone struggle so hard to put on a belt. Check it. Yep belts, I'm going to put this coat with it and this coat is from a brand called Ray. I hope I'm saying that right and please don't be mad at me if I'm not. I'm not sure 100% about the shoes I'm going to try. Probably two different things I'm going to do 1 boot on one side and these boots are, I think like a must staple in anybody's closet, and they're from the row and then I'm probably going to just put a sneaker on the other foot and see what I like better. I think I'm feeling the boots. So I'm going to go look at boots. I'm going to do this YSL bag with it because I love this bag. I use this bag a ton. I feel like it's a great everyday grab and go take the bag. I think it's really cute. I think it's simple. I think it's practical. I like it. So this is my casual Saturday look and I am wearing these really cool baggy Natasha Zinko jeans that I love. They're a little bit more tomboy. I've been photographed in these jeans quite a few times. They're my favorite fit. I love these ones. I don't care to repeat them. This sweater is from mango. It's so easy to just throw on. It's a great color. I would definitely do sneakers, so I'm going to do these white. Air Force ones. I weirdly sneakers like literally everything. I think the way you can keep something really casual really chic is the way that you accessorize it or dress it up. Because it's such a casual outfit, I like to elevate it with a cool bag. I particularly like this adorable little baby Prada bag and I like the color. I know people always see me wearing a bun. I know people are tired of it, but sometimes I'm just lazy and I don't feel like doing my hair so that throwing a little baseball hat. This one says I am a voter which I am and you should be too. Hopefully you're registered. Hopefully you're going to get out there and vote. It's so important. Please do it. So this is my Sunday look and this is a look that I would do at home if we were having people over hosting Sunday dinner recently decided we're going to do a once a month pizza night at our house. I don't have shoes on right now because if I was going to wear this at home, I'd probably just be barefoot. We have a no shoes rule in our house which I've never been too picky about. Shoes in the house, but my husband does not like it. I like that it almost looks like pajamas, but it's a little bit more elevated. I love matching set. This one is by Nushka which is another brand that I really, really love. You know I have my days where I like to be a bit more girly. A bit more grown up and then I have my days where I like to be a bit more tomboy and I feel like this is like the opposite end of the spectrum of tomboy for me. Thank you vogue. That was what I wear in a week. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I hope maybe you were able to pick up some tips or inspired to try something a little bit different with your style. I'll see you next time."

How to Decide What's Ordinary and What's Luxury When  Shopping Vintage - Vintage Bowles","I think because of my working life, I'm really drawn to pieces that were used to create iconic images at the time, because that shows me that the fashion editors, the grace coddington's on the Tony Goodmans of the 30s and 40s and 50s were thinking this is the key piece that represents the designers work this season I am Hamish Bowles, international editor at large for Vogue magazine. I travel the world seeking out the most singular pieces to add to my couture collection. A collection which I spent nearly a lifetime assembling. If it's out there, I'll find it on vintage bowls. Today I'm going to dealer on the Left Bank in Paris. She's someone I've really known for decades now. Good to see you, she said. Pretty could be resolved. Deal girl just pray say no say tsumiki on me. Yeah, I know. They don't design. Because you both say it off it I meet you. Is yoga needed to take on a belly every now and then she has a great couture fashion item that would interest me so it's always worth having a look and she's a great colorful character. She certainly understands when she has something good in this is a connoisseur you know and the way he was, just very young. I think I was a fashion student at Saint Martins. Wait a long time ago. I can tell you. Everything is mixed in. I mean you have to have a taste for going through racks and racks and racks of clothes, which luckily I have not lost that taste. I actually really enjoy things that are that are not curated that are found together like that because it sort of makes the hunt a little bit more exciting. There was a day or two piece linen ensemble from 1952. Quite simple and low key, but had this really amazing technique of kind of not embroidery. This is all. Done by hand, actually from a distance it would just look like a print of the design of the wearer and anyone getting super close to her would understand that it was actually an incredible feat of embroidery. And that's just the kind of outrageous couture detail at a house like Christianity or specialized in something. It was just so outrageously luxurious. But maybe only the wearer herself and her ladies made would really understand that. And then she had a Pierre Cardan piece from about 1960, which is interesting because. It's when car Don was still kind of linked to an idea of 50s couture. He began his working life as a tailor at Christian Dior when he established his own house. His aesthetic was very much in that kind of mid century oak Couture world later into the 60s he became one of the kind of futurist fashion gurus, so it's sort of just as a historic document. It's interesting to see a piece from from that transition period where. You still have a sense of 50s couture and you don't really have a sense of the Maverick forward thinking guy to come."

Business Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com","Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel today. I'm gonna be showing you how to straighten your hair without using any heat and this works for any kind of hair texture, curly, WAVY anything it's awesome and it's completely damage free so I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial and let's get started. So here's my hair before I wash it. It's always really frizzy when I brush it. You guys know the struggle when you have curly hair. It just never looks cute when you brush it. I'm going to brush through it though. Make sure that all of the tangles are out because we want to make sure that everything is really silky smooth before we start the process. OK step one is washing your hair. Make sure that you wash and condition your hair but don't use any special masks or try anything too crazy because if you try to use anything that's really hydrating, your hair can turn out a little bit stringy and greasy looking and that's not really what we're going for. So try to avoid that. OK, Step 2. Even though we just brushed our hair I I always get up the shower with like a million knots so I have to do it again. I'm going to use my tangle teaser and smooth everything down and then we're going to work on straightening the roots. It wasn't so easy figuring out how to get straight hair without using heat. I mean it wasn't the most simple thing, but one of the things I figured out through my trials and tribulations was to do this step before I start actually straightening. Quote UN quote, straightening the hair, I'm going to straighten the roots by pulling my hair back into a really tight ponytail. And I mean like as tight as you can possibly get it. I'm going to put my hair into a ponytail and make sure that everything remains as tight as I made it. And then I'm going to take a fine tooth comb. I really like using Combs like this because they have so many teeth that it really allows the hair to turn out really super straight. So I recommend getting one if you don't have one already. It's really helpful. So now I'm going to wait about an hour for the roots to dry. This of course tax on a little bit of extra time to the entire ordeal, but it's really important and if you have curly hair, you know what it's like to have curly roots and then really straight ends. It's kind of annoying, so this eliminates that possibility. I forgot to do it on camera, but I did put my hair in a bun shortly after I stopped filming because you wanna keep the ends of your hair wet. We still haven't molded them so you want to make sure that they're still wet. But of course if they do dry you can just take a spray bottle and wet the rest of your head. Now you can see the roots are really dry, and they're actually really straight, which is impressive and we don't have to worry about those anymore, so I'm going to take the rest of my hair and put it behind my head. And now I'm going to take sections about one inch sections and start brushing them through. This is how we're going to straighten the hair. I'm taking the section and wrapping it around as if it's like a headband. You want to make sure that this is really tight and very, very smooth, because this is how your hair is going to end up. So if you don't straighten the hair with the comb, it's not going to turn out straight. I would like to use like 3 or 4 Bobby pins because it helps keep everything in, especially because I sleep with this in overnight. A lot of the time, so you know it's a lot easier to keep it in that way, and then I'm going to keep doing the exact same thing to the rest of my hair. I like to kind of pin it near the crown area where I would wear a headband. This is my personal preference, but wherever you want to lay your hair flat, that's exactly where it's going to work. As long as you're laying it really tight and flat to your head, it's going to work, so this is kind of just personal preference, and when you try it a couple of times you come up with your favorite kind of method. So here's what it should look like when everything is wrapped up, I like to take a scarf and just secure everything so that I can sleep on it. Of course, if you're not sleeping on it, you don't have to do this, but I do recommend it if you're going to be rolling around at night. And I also recommend keeping this in for at least five hours if you're not going to sleep on it. Make sure that your hair is completely dry before you take it out. Once all of the hair on your head is dry, make sure that you take out all of the Bobby pins and you can reveal your heatless straight hair. I love this so much and the first time I tried it, I wanted to tell you guys it wasn't so easy. It didn't turn out perfect and it took a lot of trial and error, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't come out perfect. All that might mean is that you have to tweak your method, maybe use smaller strands, more Bobby pins and make sure you're tightening the hair as best you can and you'll have perfectly straight smooth hair. I really hope you guys like this tutorial and I hope that it saves you a little bit of damage in your everyday styling. If you want to see more tutorials like this, give those thumbs up and let's see really really soon. I love you."

Marisa Tomei's Guide to Natural Skin Care & Everyday Makeup | Beauty Secrets | Vogue","Hi, I'm Marisa Tomei and I am going to show you what gets me through the day. We're just starting out in the morning I washed my face and I always have a lot of water with me. I have a shake in the morning. I take chlorella especially. If I ate something salty or sugary or hallux drink because Chlorella is really good for hangover and all kinds of toxins. This chlorella, there's a couple of times that I use, but this one is sun food. I always kept it really simple as I grew up, I was interested in meditation and in grounding myself and that kind of led to how do I take care of my body the best way. So I always kept it really simple. Also probably a bit lazy and probably a bit busy so I just do the minimum vitamin D ladies need to take a lot of vitamin D. It's cancer preventative. Good for your overall health. I was always dancing when I was young, so I always was very grateful to my body and wanted to take care of her. So that's probably that started that relationship and relying on my body when I met Lisa Bonet and we became really good friends. Probably when she was 16 and I was probably 17 and a half and she was really into this stuff too. So we always liked the house, the product and whatever was at the health food store. So we kind of went on that old journey together. My hair is real, I just want to put that out to the world because everyone asked me if it's extensions they're not. Let's get into skin care. My first step is this soap. It's cedar fellow. I stick to a routine, mostly because I can't have things with chemicals that they get very red and just like break out, they don't make my skin doesn't like it when I'm working and there's a lot more makeup put on to my face, which I don't. I don't like a lot of foundation and we try to keep that really light, but still I always go back to these these things. The hydration is the main thing. Intelligent nutrients. It's just a little. And then one spritz of this serum that goes with it. I never had that extra little step of that liquid green oil. I just always kept it simple. I'm just I've been washing my face with the sitafal forever, probably because I saw something in Vogue talking about C to fill at some point in my life. This I got at the Sundance Film Festival. There was a makeup artist who worked with me. He was from Europe and he had this home neoplasm mean that. It just keeps my lips super soft and moist. This is by Persephone and it's also made with all organic bio dynamic ingredients. That's that's the common thread with the things that go on to my body. This little gem is a recent addition. It's called mother. You can see me instead of goes fast and so it's it's Shea butter based and you just kind of emulsify it. While we're on limbs, I'm a big fan of Lord Jones. It's a CBD based kind of anti inflammatory, but what is really great for is when you're wearing heels at night or you're going to be standing for a long period of time putting some on your calves and your feet. You can stay in heels for. Forever and not and not feel any pain. There's a special one called Stiletto Cream. I would say the number one thing that I can't, I just can't leave the house that is my. To say no eyelash curler and I'm usually like 12345. Sometimes they use a little concealer. That's clay depo. Coming from Brooklyn, we used to put like tons of mascara on which I still really love this one. Is Lancome Mr. Big really like lays it on thick but when I was younger and laying on the mascara we used to use a safety pin to open up the lashes and that was also the punk rock days and the person who taught me to do all the way that I got in the habit of doing my tips like. This and then sometimes going on the top part of the lash to get like an extra coat in. Where's my junior high school friend, Ronnie Rosenberg. I do deal with my brows now differently. Been trying to grow them in for some time since they were super overplucked in the 90s. They were thin to begin with and as I get older I noticed that from here out they just kind of fade away. So I'm always trying to fill in. The outer parts. Of the brow with this Nars Christy striker has a very very super thin liquid pen that you can. Just barely start to. They're as fine as hairs. I put on a little bit of Charlotte Hillsbury. Blush I also Emma. Victim of overdoing it 'cause I always think I look too washed out. Put that a little bit there, and sometimes I stick it here and then at the end I take the hair down. Sometimes I put it back up, put it back up and down like three times. Also and I have a little thing for my for my greys, which is fine. You write all day just 66. I almost said 67. Guess I'm getting used to it 57. And that's it. It's pretty easy. Everyday, run around now I'm ready to start my day. Thanks for watching bye."
