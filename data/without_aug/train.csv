I've experienced it a lot, i write about it accurately. mine were induced by marijuana and a recent PTSD. writing about it made me a different man, i understand myself more every day and it helped me process my past and come out as a more definitive being, it is a spiritual experience that made me closer to the universe and the concept of God.

Now it's almost 2022, and my anxiety is gone! Of course, I might get a little more nervous about something than other people will, but I'm still young, so there was enough time to do something about it. I had a total of only two panic attacks during that time, and both times I was extremely scared of dying. I thought I was going to die and those thoughts wouldn't leave my mind. So I started to take care of myself. Every time I looked in the mirror I'd think nice things about myself and what I saw in the reflection. I remember when the attacks happened, I'd always think ""This too, shall pass"" and start to feel a little better. I think both times my attacks happened it was because of a lack of sleep. The first time it happened I had no idea what was going on so I locked myself in the bathroom and texted my friend about what was happening, and he comforted me through it. The second time it was a smaller attack and wasn't as scary because I knew what to do and knew what was going on this time, but either way it's still a fright. My attacks didn't last the whole day, only for a few minutes or a little longer, but I would still be a bit shaken up for the rest of the day. You all are so strong, and I believe in you. I made it, so I have no doubt that you all will too. I'm forever grateful to everyone who helped me with my anxiety, so I want to help people with theirs in return.

I'd cry almost every night because I felt weak and tired of it all but as many people struggling with mental health, I was scared of going to therapy and getting help. One night at 1am I told my parents that I'm ready to see a professional and that is the best decision I have ever made to this day. It only took one session with someone who understood me. My appetite started improving and slowly but surely I was starting to stress less about my panic attacks. I haven't had one since, so it's been 4 years now. To anyone who's going through this: tell yourself you're ok and mean it! You are going to be fine. It will pass trust me! This is how I got out of a very dark place in my life and it took me months but once you start thinking optimistically and clearing your head of such bad thoughts, the attacks will leave once and for all!",None,no

In Gal. 2:14 Paul said this to Peter "" But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"" Peter got caught up worrying about what the Judaizers would think rather then the truth of the gospel, And Paul had to rebuke him.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc,religion,"The argument: ""we shouldn't use the word 'cult' in a pejorative sense"" is a strange one. For this to be sustainable you'd have to ignore the fact that language shifts over time , similar to your characterization of ""religions"" in other videos. Alternatively you would need to assert academic primacy in language use: ""only academics can use words definitively"". But in that case, ""religion"" itself should only be used by academics since (as Jonathan Z. Smith noted), ""“Religion is not a native term. It is a term invented by scholars for their intellectual purposes and is therefore theirs to define. "" Notice how often in public discourse 'religion/religious/etc. are weaponized in exactly the same way that ""cult"" can be used: to marginalize, differentiate the ""other"", and dismiss. Just read some of the comments in your videos or listen to Bill Maher. Words have a general use and specific, in-group use. It's in everyone's interest to maintain linguistic continuity (to promote society-wide communication), even while acknowledging the continual evolution of language. In-group specialized usage of words goes far in preserving language meaning since the group population is smaller than the general population. For this reason, calling another group ""cult"" within a specific group likely carries specific meaning for that group and playing the ""academic definition"" card has no salutary effect. It's meaningful to understand the semantic range of a word, including academic usage, but attempts at linguistic policing are misguided when herding cats is easier than herding word use. Unless there is thought-control of Orwellian proportions, the wisest course is to seek to be understood and to understand the individuals we are in communication with at any given moment.",None,no

People see them as annoying, but really they serve a purpose to protect the bare soil. over time as a more diverse group of plants come in, they will replace the weeds to return to a healthy, balanced, diverse ecosystem. Yeast in your body is the same. If you are lacking the balanced microbial ecosystem, the yeast will come in and take over to protect the “bare soil”. So really, the answer to dandruff is to restore a balanced microbial ecosystem, not fight and destroy the yeast. They will just keep coming back.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg,fitness,"What Makes Muscles Grow? (Transcrição) Muscles. We have over 600 of them. They make up between 1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight, and along with connective tissue, they bind us together, hold us up, and help us move. And whether or not body building is your hobby, muscles need your constant attention because the way you treat them on a daily basis determines whether they will wither or grow. Say you’re standing in front of a door, ready to pull it open. Your brain and muscles are perfectly poised to help you achieve this goal. First, your brain sends a signal to motor neurons inside your arm. When they receive this message, they fire, causing muscles to contract and relax, which pull on the bones in your arm and generate the needed movement. The bigger the challenge becomes, the bigger the brain’s signal grows, and the more motor units it rallies to help you achieve your task. But what if the door is made of solid iron? At this point, your arm muscles alone won’t be able to generate enough tension to pull it open, so your brain appeals to other muscles for help. You plant your feet, tighten your belly, and tense your back, generating enough force to yank it open. Your nervous system has just leveraged the resources you already have, other muscles, to meet the demand. While all this is happening, your muscle fibers undergo another kind of cellular change. As you expose them to stress, they experience microscopic damage, which, in this context, is a good thing. In response, the injured cells release inflammatory molecules called cytokines that activate the immune system to repair the injury. This is when the muscle-building magic happens. The greater the damage to the muscle tissue, the more your body will need to repair itself. The resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles bigger and stronger as they adapt to progressively greater demands. Since our bodies have already adapted to most everyday activities, those generally don’t produce enough stress to stimulate new muscle growth. So, to build new muscle, a process called hypertrophy, our cells need to be exposed to higher workloads than they are used to. In fact, if you don’t continuously expose your muscles to some resistance, they will shrink, a process known as muscular atrophy. In contrast, exposing the muscle to a high-degree of tension, especially while the muscle is lengthening, also called an eccentric contraction, generates effective conditions for new growth. However, muscles rely on more than just activity to grow. Without proper nutrition, hormones, and rest, your body would never be able to repair damaged muscle fibers. Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building blocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids. Adequate protein intake, along with naturally occurring hormones, like insulin-like growth factor and testosterone, help shift the body into a state where tissue is repaired and grown. This vital repair process mainly occurs when we’re resting, especially at night while sleeping. Gender and age affect this repair mechanism, which is why young men with more testosterone have a leg up in the muscle building game. Genetic factors also play a role in one’s ability to grow muscle. Some people have more robust immune reactions to muscle damage, and are better able to repair and replace damaged muscle fibers, increasing their muscle-building potential. The body responds to the demands you place on it. If you tear your muscles up, eat right, rest and repeat, you’ll create the conditions to make your muscles as big and strong as possible. It is with muscles as it is with life: Meaningful growth requires challenge and stress.",None,no

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s,religion,"He left out the earliest anti-gnostic Christian writer. Read Iraneus' Against Heresies, in which he details gnostic beliefs and precisely why they are false in light of Holy Scripture. Thomas was one of the early gnostic writings from when much of their mythology was still undeveloped, but it IS a gnostic text. The reason it was left out of Scripture is not because it was unpopular, but because the Christian churches copied and kept only writings known to have been written by an Apostle or a close associate thereof. For example, Matthew and John were both Apostles, Mark was a close protégé of Simon Peter, and Luke was a protégé of both Peter and Paul. Antilegomina texts were not known to be apostolic, but were overtly Christian. Thomas and other gnostic writings were never even candidates for inclusion in the Cannon. Also, given that gnostic mythology was so highly developed by Iraneus' day, gnosticism must have started pretty early in the 2nd century. However, an informed reading of John's Gospel and his first epistle will perceive an effort in his part to refute proto-gnostic heresies that had just started to become popular and infiltrate the fringes of the Christian church.",None,no
