https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc,religion,"The argument: ""we shouldn't use the word 'cult' in a pejorative sense"" is a strange one. For this to be sustainable you'd have to ignore the fact that language shifts over time , similar to your characterization of ""religions"" in other videos. Alternatively you would need to assert academic primacy in language use: ""only academics can use words definitively"". But in that case, ""religion"" itself should only be used by academics since (as Jonathan Z. Smith noted), ""‚ÄúReligion is not a native term. It is a term invented by scholars for their intellectual purposes and is therefore theirs to define. "" Notice how often in public discourse 'religion/religious/etc. are weaponized in exactly the same way that ""cult"" can be used: to marginalize, differentiate the ""other"", and dismiss. Just read some of the comments in your videos or listen to Bill Maher. Words have a general use and specific, in-group use. It's in everyone's interest to maintain linguistic continuity (to promote society-wide communication), even while acknowledging the continual evolution of language. In-group specialized usage of words goes far in preserving language meaning since the group population is smaller than the general population. For this reason, calling another group ""cult"" within a specific group likely carries specific meaning for that group and playing the ""academic definition"" card has no salutary effect. It's meaningful to understand the semantic range of a word, including academic usage, but attempts at linguistic policing are misguided when herding cats is easier than herding word use. Unless there is thought-control of Orwellian proportions, the wisest course is to seek to be understood and to understand the individuals we are in communication with at any given moment.",no

Yeast in your body is the same. If you are lacking the balanced microbial ecosystem, the yeast will come in and take over to protect the ‚Äúbare soil‚Äù. So really, the answer to dandruff is to restore a balanced microbial ecosystem, not fight and destroy the yeast. They will just keep coming back.

They make up between 1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight, and along with connective tissue, they bind us together, hold us up, and help us move. And whether or not body building is your hobby, muscles need your constant attention because the way you treat them on a daily basis determines whether they will wither or grow. Say you‚Äôre standing in front of a door, ready to pull it open. Your brain and muscles are perfectly poised to help you achieve this goal. First, your brain sends a signal to motor neurons inside your arm. When they receive this message, they fire, causing muscles to contract and relax, which pull on the bones in your arm and generate the needed movement. The bigger the challenge becomes, the bigger the brain‚Äôs signal grows, and the more motor units it rallies to help you achieve your task. But what if the door is made of solid iron? At this point, your arm muscles alone won‚Äôt be able to generate enough tension to pull it open, so your brain appeals to other muscles for help. You plant your feet, tighten your belly, and tense your back, generating enough force to yank it open. Your nervous system has just leveraged the resources you already have, other muscles, to meet the demand. While all this is happening, your muscle fibers undergo another kind of cellular change. As you expose them to stress, they experience microscopic damage, which, in this context, is a good thing. In response, the injured cells release inflammatory molecules called cytokines that activate the immune system to repair the injury. This is when the muscle-building magic happens. The greater the damage to the muscle tissue, the more your body will need to repair itself. The resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles bigger and stronger as they adapt to progressively greater demands. Since our bodies have already adapted to most everyday activities, those generally don‚Äôt produce enough stress to stimulate new muscle growth. So, to build new muscle, a process called hypertrophy, our cells need to be exposed to higher workloads than they are used to. In fact, if you don‚Äôt continuously expose your muscles to some resistance, they will shrink, a process known as muscular atrophy. In contrast, exposing the muscle to a high-degree of tension, especially while the muscle is lengthening, also called an eccentric contraction, generates effective conditions for new growth. However, muscles rely on more than just activity to grow. Without proper nutrition, hormones, and rest, your body would never be able to repair damaged muscle fibers. Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building blocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids. Adequate protein intake, along with naturally occurring hormones, like insulin-like growth factor and testosterone, help shift the body into a state where tissue is repaired and grown. This vital repair process mainly occurs when we‚Äôre resting, especially at night while sleeping. Gender and age affect this repair mechanism, which is why young men with more testosterone have a leg up in the muscle building game. Genetic factors also play a role in one‚Äôs ability to grow muscle. Some people have more robust immune reactions to muscle damage, and are better able to repair and replace damaged muscle fibers, increasing their muscle-building potential. The body responds to the demands you place on it. If you tear your muscles up, eat right, rest and repeat, you‚Äôll create the conditions to make your muscles as big and strong as possible. It is with muscles as it is with life: Meaningful growth requires challenge and stress.",no

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s,religion,"He left out the earliest anti-gnostic Christian writer. Read Iraneus' Against Heresies, in which he details gnostic beliefs and precisely why they are false in light of Holy Scripture. Thomas was one of the early gnostic writings from when much of their mythology was still undeveloped, but it IS a gnostic text. The reason it was left out of Scripture is not because it was unpopular, but because the Christian churches copied and kept only writings known to have been written by an Apostle or a close associate thereof. For example, Matthew and John were both Apostles, Mark was a close prot√©g√© of Simon Peter, and Luke was a prot√©g√© of both Peter and Paul. Antilegomina texts were not known to be apostolic, but were overtly Christian. Thomas and other gnostic writings were never even candidates for inclusion in the Cannon. Also, given that gnostic mythology was so highly developed by Iraneus' day, gnosticism must have started pretty early in the 2nd century. However, an informed reading of John's Gospel and his first epistle will perceive an effort in his part to refute proto-gnostic heresies that had just started to become popular and infiltrate the fringes of the Christian church.",no
