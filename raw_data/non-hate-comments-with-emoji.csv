Honestly there should be a means of financial growth. That’s why I'm always excited everytime I see videos about financiaI growth. It just reminds me of my journey last year and how I made significant returns of over 5x in 8months just by making the right decision of finding an experienced lnvestment advisor . Goodluck to y'all out there trying to grow your money through investments

3	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYQhnatPnZQ	i watched videos from india in the 1980s and 1990s about the economy, india was growing back then too at 8-9% problem is that it looked like it does today, because when you have a country that is stuck with stagflation for decades you dont actually grow. Numbers from india cant be real, and india wont grow like this, burocracy, trade barriers, investments barriers, lack of education from the people, cant grow.

88	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	The ruling BJP is having the comfortable majority to pass any bill and amendment.the opposition parties can't do anything except barking like a street dogs
89	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	Most of the protesters are congress workers and middlemen.
90	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	I want to know is there any bill which was passed without opposition ( Congress ) protesting they basically blame every bill BJP introduced
91	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	There is no use in dealing with corrupt govt ,middleman. Corporate is always competitive among themselves, so if u are not satisfied with one company there is always another one who is ready to accept your price to run there business.
92	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	Small scale farmers never had a say in such matters. Affluent farmers and local political parties had monopoly in APMC since days of slavery. I am happy for this reform even its delayed by 74 years

95	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	People. No one of us is a pure God fallen from heaven so is not modi. But he is the PM we need right now because he is doing a lot of things rather than selling our country to west like congress did.

97	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	I don't know why only congres and opposition party are opposing bill?? But no farmer protest against this bill
98	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	A bill which was needed. Congress is opposing bcoz they think it is thier bill

102	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	The same congress was using this same bill in their manifesto ..what an hypocrite.. The only places where they are protesting against is in Punjab and Harayana....just imagine how pathetic their intentions are ..they don't want farmers to come up in society and lead a decent life.😭😭 I am very happy that the bill has been passed ❤️ Jai Hind Jai Bharat 🙏
103	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v430BmlLHSM	The problem with this bill is that the Modi government has not taken a proactive stance on clarifying objections. These reforms are much needed, but if Modi doesn't address the farmers directly, then this will be like Shaheen Bagh 2.0. Farmers will only realize the benefits after some time. Until then the opposition will ensure that BJP loses all state elections. Unless this bull is taken by the horns.

170	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	I want to see the right people held accountable for breaking our country down
171	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	We really need more like Jesse!!! Straight forward , and knows how to connect with people!!!
172	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	If you have guests please give them questions ahead of time. Great answers come from thoughtful consideration not just what comes off the top of your head at the time. Being fastest on your feet doesn't mean you are right. I would much rather have serious thought given to serious questions. JOMO
173	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	So glad to have him prime time! C’mon Jesse, give it to ‘em, you need to be our voice.
174	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Congratulations Jesse, you deserve it! I totally love getting the news with so much humor! 😊
175	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	I just don't get why it took so long for them to give you this show. It's about time!

177	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	After seeing some of the people Jesse interviewed on the street, all of my questions have been answered about why New York is in the condition it is. Jesse Watters is a true American Patriot, and he speaks the truth.
178	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Keep telling the TRUTH and you will do just fine Mr. Jesse Watters. Looking forward to seeing your new show.
179	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Congrats on the show! I just have to say I can't believe how braindead and brainwashed people have become since big tech and social media became available in the palm of your hand. Watching those street interviews was so hard to watch
180	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Yo I've been watching this channel religiously for the past year and have not glimpsed at cnn or any other msnbc. I live in Australia and wish we had a channel here in this country that cares about the truth as much as you do. I sincerely hope once the fame and money comes though you guys won't sell out. This is the last hope I have for humanity and the truth. Please don't ever change.
181	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Don’t leave out the Republicans they are just as bad, we need to clean house. We need conservatives in office
182	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Prob speaking for millions when I say this: Jesse have liked constantly how you continue to go out into the world and interview real people , so glad the tradition is continuing on Primetime, as always fox is honest , unafraid and to the point but your shows adds that extra humor you just don't get anywhere else
183	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Great sense of humor. Speaks out for the people in a non polarizing way

188	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Can't wait to see what your show has in store for the next episodes. Too bad I don't have cable (I cut that cord) but I will look for clips on that media platform....Oh you know which one tube.
189	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	I can see why Bill O'Reilly picked this guy all those years ago. This is going to be a fun show to watch 😁
190	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Huge congrats, Jesse! This is YOUR time. Go get 'em, tiger. Looking forward to keeping the pressure on the bad actors in our society, you ROCK!

193	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	The clips in between Jesse's on the street interviews were hilarious.
194	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Greetings from the island of Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 I love your show and how Wright you are in the topics. Keep on growing we need more like you in the media
195	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Jesse , don't ever change the format where you interview the American people, for some reason it is impossible to stop watching them, I think you know the reason.Good luck!!!!
196	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Nice start Jesse, everyone need to know the fact, no matter how hurt or how bad it is, it's hard to express in a sense of humor, but I think Jesse can.
197	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	I can’t believe they named a highway after Brandon in Scranton, there was a 10 car wreck on it just like the country.
198	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	As always..Jesse is my favorite person on fox, there’s something easy, simple and fun about him.. I think it’s going to be a big hit

204	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	We need a segment on why covid vaccines haven't been advertised in America. If they're so great, why no TV commercials, radio spots, or streaming advertisements? Big pharma loves to tell us to ask our doctor if (insert pill name) is right for you. Maybe it has sometime to do with listing the possible side effects. I haven't seen a story about this on any mainstream news.
205	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	I live in Morocco, and Fox News makes me feel like an American patriot.

So I did and immediately got a reply text saying ""your text to xxx-xxx-xxxx was deleted. So much for that. Maybe on the next episode he can explain why this phone number is rejecting the texts."
224	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZbKAEQZHiE	Greatest intro ever….never change it Jessie!

235	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aMRQGwiuo8	How is it a failed promise if people aren't helping out with the issues? I promise you will count to ten and you don't. How is that MY fault? If I promise voting rights restored and someone isn't helping out, that's not my fault. If I say we can end the virus and people refuse vaccines, how is that MY fault?

242	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aMRQGwiuo8	"Imagine: Circumstances find you in a lifeboat with Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Jen Psaki when Joe pulls out a cordless power drill and starts making holes in the bottom of the boat causing the water to rush in. Instead of helping you bail out the water, Harris sits there laughing. The only person you can go to is Psaki and you ask her why is Joe deliberately sinking the boat while Harris does absolutely nothing to remedy the problem. Psaki would respond that she doesn't agree with your assessment of the situation and then launch into another, ""I won't comment on the matter but what I can tell you is, and as you know we addressed this issue before if you were paying attention, that the president and vice president have been working on (some other subject other than the crisis at hand and will be doing this and have done this and word salad and BS galore). And at the end as all four of you are treading water to survive, CNN will send a boat by to rescue Psaki so she can be a political guest on their programs."
243	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aMRQGwiuo8	"I always flash on this old episode of ""Cheers"" where Frasier helps get Woody elected to congress and Woody fails upwards to the presidency and Frasier starts having nightmares of Woody using nukes. This is what I thought of when Trump was elected five years ago. I thought everything was going to turn into a tacky reality series. Instead about a year and a half into Trumps turn I noticed things were...good. I had more money, more time. Things were certainly less violent and crime ridden. The bad things that I thought were going to happen to us for those four years have been happening to us the past twelve months and they show no signs of slowing down. I wasn't a trumper while he was president but the past year has made me one. They are not coming for us. They are here now."

The People elected them since that is true the man to blame is each an every one of us. We Americans don't know accountability. We've been bullied into ""Don't Judge!"" for so long that we no longer hold anyone accountable. When you can't hold your neighbor accountable, face to face, how then do we expect to hold the criminals in DC accountable? I don't mean to incite Americans to quarrel with one another, I mean that we need to get off of our screens and talk to our neighbors. Each of us thinks, ""I can't change anything."" You're right! But WE can. Take the time to reach out, and talk to your neighbors, openly, about our country. thats how to fix it. Fellowship, to ACTION"

421	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Thes cops give cops a bad name! He was a person with a snowflake agenda! Who let this happen? Did Bernie get the blame for Scalis??
422	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	To all the people that are talking about moving barriers and why wasn't security in place it does still not answer why the Republicans attacked the Capitol building in force.
423	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	What those officers felt, that is the way everyday people feel when, the law enforcement agencies make mistakes on us law abiding citizens. They are human, yes, but so are we.
424	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	who did mostly benefit of January 6 events?
425	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	There is no reason why Trump supporters that are also pro police would be violent towards those officers. Makes zero sense.
426	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	If you're going after the truth of what happened, why is McCarthy preventing his 3 choices that weren't objected to? Wouldn't Armstrong, Davis, and Nehls there be better than nobody you wanted? Did he just take his ball and go home?
427	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	He poses good questions. But why did republican senators Reject a 50/50 commission! It’s Trumpism. Republicans want what they want because of Trump. Trump encouraged this attack. Do you like to watch dictators take over their countries? Why, why shouldn’t we be outraged that someone would DARE to do that in America?
428	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	#1 question: Why were those people even there? When robbers rob a bank, you don't ask why the security was breached, you ask who encouraged them to do so?
429	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Why don't Fox play January 6th hearing lol. Not surprised
430	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	It was Nancy's Plan. She did not take proper steps to secure the area. In fact , one of the D.C. Police. Departments was told there would be no need for extra security and to send some of the scheduled officers home. Just another ploy by Pelosi to bring Trump down. I have never seen such hate I see in Nancy's cold cruel heart.
431	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	So if someone breaks in my house the question that republicans ask is why I did have security? And because my guards didn't have the same equipment that the trespassers, that needs to be the question I stead of how and why?
432	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	A report that the sgt at arms denied security more than once, where WHY? The actions of the police, fbi...and to make pelosi off limits is to cut out key questions and answers.

This is not a joke, how can fox hurt there country like this .10 years from now these idiots will be a stain to there country. Look at all the Trump flags .Come on the world is shaking its head. A great country now falling apart.
437	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	The Capital “riot”? What about all the other riots, looting, burnings, assaults, and killings that happened in the major cities. Why is Pelosi off limits? There should be nothing off limits during an investigation especially if it was such a big deal.
438	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	If Pelosi cannot be questioned that is protecting her. Why??? What is she hiding and hiding from???

445	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	"They won't even ask me question, ""Who shot Ashley Babbitt?"". Answer: A black security ""person"" - he wasn't even a policeman. ""Rioters"" were asking a legitimate question: There's something very fishy, very wrong, ""questionable"" about the outcome of the election; could we please look into it before confirming the results? I still want to, need to, know who actually won the election. There were far too many anomalies with the outcome of the 2020 election. Was our government ""overthrown from within‽‽ I don't have the answer and neither does anyone else."
446	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Did the murderer who killed Ashley Babbitt testify? Yeah right. They're really getting to the truth aren't they? A huge heap of BS coming out of Washington like always.

452	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	More Fox news trash none of those officers were in danger of Trump supporters. It was feds antifa blm and Q idiots!!! All a set up show us the 15000 hers of capital video.

454	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	They need to show the kid who asked three officers in swat gear why they weren’t doing anything to stop the riot. That kid was wearing a Trump hat.
455	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	We'll see if they bring up all of the undercover agents involved. Just like the kidnapping plan of a governor was actually planned and pushed by undercover agents.

462	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	This is not a bipartisan commission; it's a left-leaning, anti-Trump sham. The only questions that will be asked are those that come up with the preconceived, predetermined answers of the the Left (Pondwater Pelosi, et al).

468	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I have yet to hear the answer as to why the capital police moved the barricades and waved the protesters inside. Then Twitter band anyone sharing the videos, and essentially deleted them from the Internet
469	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Pelosi was responible for 6th January with her Antifa buddys. She organized the storming of the White House.

480	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I believe it is stupid. Isn’t the capitol a building paid by tax payers where their employees the politicians should work and respect the law? So it is the people’s house. People should be allowed in. Why do politicians fear if they do the right thing? All politicians that do not work for the people should be removed not get rich on tax money and own corrupt businesses. If you work for a company and have inside information you are not allowed to use it. Politicians and their families should not be either.

485	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I'd like to see Nancy pelosi under oath answering a bunch of questions about the lack of security and the lack of concern. I also like to see a list of all the people arrested so we can see if there's any antifa or BLM on the list. Of Course it's apparent why she didn't want Jim Jordan on the panel. Where were all of our security agencies , I guess the NSA was too busy spying on Tucker Carlson.
486	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Is anyone surprised that this whole administration is a scam.
487	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Who killed Ashley Babbitt should be the first question by any republicans

490	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	"Of course any questions about Jan. 6th and what Nancy Pelosi knew in advance is ""Off Limits"" her involvement will be covered up. She was a Major Player in the outcome at the Capital Building!"
491	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Nancy rejected 2 Republicans so they won't investigate HER. She planned it, she is responsible.

495	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	What's the point in re living the tragedy. ok we know it was bad . The question is where was the mistakes made ? What can be done to be better prepared to stop this in the future? THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A SOMEONE THAT DONT AGREE WITH THE GOVERMENT. you cant stop people from disagreeing with you but you can prepare properly to defend this.
496	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	It seems like the dems just keep winning. They are miles ahead of the republicans. The republicans can’t keep up with the dems. The dems do something crazy/insane, republicans all it out, then it’s forgotten.
497	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Can Rep Davis remind us all who eventually pulled him from serving on this committee? Does he not have the backbone to tell McCarthy he wanted to be there and ask questions? How is it Pelosi fault that McCarthy pulled him from the committee?
498	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Not one Not one in Congress had the guts to step forward and listen. They hid
499	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	We need to abolish this government. We the people , not we the blind
500	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Listen to the testimony of the police who were there. You know the police YOU ALL support.... It is clear that Trump incited the violent insurrection and even more clear that Trump supporters are racists. Not that the rest of the country ever really doubted it.
501	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	If they are going to have an investigative committee look into January 6ththen they had better have an investigative committee look into Chuck Schumer before The supreme Court building calling out justices gorsuch and kavanagh and also inciting and insurrection in front of the supreme Court buildingat which time insurgents attempted to batter down the doors of the supreme Court
502	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	This is so political that even the Democrats have to be a little nauseous. Talk about crappy theater.
503	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Who killed Ashley Babit should be the priority.
504	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Who shot Ashley Babbit?!?
505	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Oh so we can't comment on Bret Baier's statement that said they would be dismissing all ideas that fbi agents were a part of the Malay and stirring up of this, but we can comment on the one guy they interview that wants the truth. They are using this whole thing as another attempt to pin it all on Trump when it was all Pelosi and the FBI that caused the violence and security breach.
506	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Liz Cheney is more of a Conservative Republican than any of the folks put forward by McCarthy. McCarthy is the wrong guy to be leading the minority in the house.
507	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	This is a farce and means nothing to an average American!
508	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Trump supporters did it, the fact they have no spines at all to admit Trump caused it shows how pathetic they are. Republicans also blocked the bipartisan investigation now this is what they get.
509	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Up until Jan 6th, it was a widely held belief that only BLM or Antifa would be capable of becoming violent. We heard Trump telling his followers that they only needed to fear those organizations. Maybe it is the fault of Speaker Pelosi for actually believing that was the case. But to blame her for believing that lie would also cast blame on all those who were on the right and thinking the same thing. Yes, this was a failure in security. What bothers me most is that republicans, along with Rep Davis, voted against a bipartisan commission with equal numbers and equal subpoena powers. Why were/are they opposed to finding out everything?
510	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	funny how these officers said they were under attack but what about those that for the last year have been under attack by BLM . . . all i hear is crickets

519	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Make all videos public then and have anyone ask questions from Congress.

528	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	funny how fox news allows comments on videos that alain with thier narrative, but not the one where bret baier calls jan 6 testimony from capitol officers 'damning'
529	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	This bipartisan committee is partisan because of him
530	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	It was Trump and his loyalists and every Republican who lied that the election was stolen. Everybody knows truth so do ya'll So ya'll can tell all the lies ya'll want to each other but it won't change the truth.
531	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	If the republicans didnt say no to everything and run away from a commission, they may have been able to ask those questions!

535	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	It's all one sided testimony. I was there and I didn't see any of these people. Police were teargassing people who were just standing around, it was like they tried to make people mad. Antifa incited and guided protestors to do things. I didn't see enough Police and the national guard were just on traffic control.
536	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	What hell did they go through? They let the people in. THey shot an unarmed woman. They caused a stampede that killed another person. Sounds like they helped cause the hell.
537	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Pelosi is showing her power. Back in December when she allowed this to takevpkace and now as she controls the narrative. Total sham.
538	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	How is this even fair??! Republicans not allowed to pick their own ppl to serve on committee. This is nothing but another dem political SHAM, to try and make a false narrative to fit their agenda
539	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Do y’all notice Fox News is the only ones that be turning off the comment section on a lot of their videos. It’s like they know they’re viewer are trumtard conspiracy crazies
540	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Omg these republican senators are so naive and just plane stupid. This was all a setup from the left to frame Trump and his supporters..😠
541	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Is it normal for there to be hundreds of professional photographers and hundreds of video cameras during an insurrection?
542	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	He stated they were there to stop the steal and didn't confirm or deny that. Also I watched the opening monolog from the chairman and it was loaded. I would say unbelievable however totally expected.
543	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Seems she knew SHE was inciting a dare competition when she didn’t accept more protection from the police. Same O same o divide and conquer
544	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I heard two different officers testifying, on the radio news. You could tell they had been coached on what to say. Phony as heck.
545	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Republicans had the chance of a fair, bipartisan investigation. Why did they block it? THIS is the one million dollar question. And btw, why didn’t Fox News air this hearing live?
546	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	"Two ""others!"" - perfrct!!"
547	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I'm really surprised Fox News ran anything related to the Insurrection, many of the folks that support the insurrection are Fox News Viewers, Fox has to be careful, I'm sure their viewers don't want to hear or see this...
548	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I wish the anti trump rioters didnt pretent to be trump supporters.
549	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	It was a Democratic trap.. folks walked right into it
550	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Jokers Wild
551	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Jan 6 was just a tiny taste of what may come if Democrats continue to cheat and steal our elections.
552	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	IF YOU’RE NOT GOING TO TELL THE TRUTH THEN SHUT THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT, SHUT THE HECK UP AND KNOW THAT YOU WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE INSURRECTION WILL PAY THE PRICE OF BEING BROUGHT TO JUSTICE!
553	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Fox news is a clear and present danger to the safety of the citizens of the United States. They have killed hundreds of thousands of American citizens with their covid-19 misinformation and constant downplaying of the seriousness of this disease from the beginning. They are uniquely responsible for these Americans deaths, along with the former president and his lying, thieving, grifting corrupt family! They are also traitors to America with their constant praise of Putin and helping Putin divide this country from the inside. Fox News is the Kremlin's greatest weapon and must be closed down right away! The future of the American people is at stake!
554	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I always thought Obama was the worst president ever, then along came Joe Biden!
555	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	We'll get to the truth, seditionists. 😉
556	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	They only embrace officers who cry when they are giving testimony. Had Ashley been an unarmed woman of color, that would be the only thing they would be talking about.
557	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	The DOJ is going to spend $6.1 million on a January 6 database. Where is the ANTIFA database? Where is the BLM database? It’s as if the DOJ has given up on all investigations other than January 6.
558	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Why did the Capitol police have their guns takin away on that one day for their is AR on the roof as we speak
559	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	oh...Fox allows comments on this video?
560	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	YES I WANT TO KNOW WHY TRUMPY DIDNT SEND THE NATIONAL GUARD QUICK
561	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Why do Fox commentators keep saying the word insurrection? Not one individual has been charged with insurrection
562	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	"Chairman Thompson opening remarks, ""We know that the insurrection on January 6 .... We also know that the rioters came dangerously close to succeeding."" Inconceivable to this viewer that anyone of sound mind could think that the ""rioters came dangerously close to succeeding"". This hearing has already started as a political exercise. Sad that U.S. taxpayer funds are being used for such futility."
563	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Why weren't they prepared why didn't the FBI do something about this because director Ray is a bum and a trader to the United States???
564	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Pelosi can't keep from sucking on her dentures let alone assemble a committee
565	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Your, “good friend” Harry, is playing the victim-card because he had a long, rough day at work. This is a farce.
566	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Fox playing both sides I see . turning off comments on where they side against Trump....I guess you can call that non bias....cuz at least they let it all air
567	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	If they know there will be a gathering that day why won't they have officers and national guard there. ITS PELOSIS FAULT AND SHE LIES AND SHE IS GUILTY THATS WHY SHE DOESNT WANT GOOD REPUBLICANS TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS!! PELOSI SHIULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL.THESE MESS AND SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT
568	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	God Bless these policemen and THIER famileys
569	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	The answer is obvious someone was orchestrating this event because we all seen the individual waving his hands and motioning to people which way to go
570	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Nothing will happen to any of the government trash bags behind any of this and the American people will never know the truth, just a giant blame game
571	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Nancy Pelosi should be tried for treason this was a coup de tat..
572	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I can tell you that President Trump did not incite Jan 6th that sob is the one that arranged that Antifa and BLM FBI that’s just a few that I know that was there and they were there the night before I don’t know how stupid you think we are but I can tell you we are not stupid she needs to go and she needs to go now impeach her and do it now and don’t let anyone else serve over 2 years period
573	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	And both of the RINOs will be voted out of office.
574	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	sounds like they are protecting piglosy
575	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	"Will the cops that opened the Capitol doors to the ""insurrectionists"" be called to testify?"
576	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I BLAME BIDEN AND DEMOCRATS FOR LETTING PEOPEL IN 💯💯💯💯💯
577	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	What the officers went through? If they were a bit traumatised by that then I think they should be working somewhere else. I don’t think they’re qualified for that job
578	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Let's see if Miss Pelosi shows the video of antifa running around inside the capital in all black breaking stuff and trying to set fires and then being caught on film dressing up in Maga gear
579	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	They had intel that BLM & Antifa would infiltrate the protest's and STILL Pelosi did nothing.
580	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I am now 100% officially done with fox for airing that sham of a hearing today

585	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Vets are spinning in their graves for siding with the communists in WW2.
586	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	But…. Capitol police let the people in. So there is that.
587	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	who killed Ashli ? he is a coward to shoot woman, she did nothing wrong
588	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	And what is to become of this one sided “investigation”?
589	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	I want to know how many FBI agents were talking to attendees prior to the Jan. 6 riot.
590	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Where is the cop that shot the unarmed woman veteran Ashli Babbitt ?
591	171	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Ashli Babbitt got the justice she deserved. RIP Brian Sicknick. Justice is coming. WE WILL NEVER FORGET.
592	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T46XQHCUgmc	Put Nancy Pelosi under oath and start asking her questions about her role in organizing the break ins.

653	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf2Q9novjs	For centuries, we Poles have wanted to live in peace, but unfortunately our geographic location between military powers has always forced us to fight and defend our country. We cannot be broken, we have disappeared from maps for 123 years and our country and culture survived anyway. We can always unite and cooperate in the face of threats like no other nation in the world.
654	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf2Q9novjs	Why can't we see any poland people youtubes instead of news chosen media?
655	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf2Q9novjs	Ireland is planning for 100,000 Ukrainians to come here, about 10,000 have already arrived. If we all work together the EU states can accommodate all Ukrainian refugees.

661	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf2Q9novjs	Poland, you deal with them. Didn’t see Poland taking any refugees from middle east when Europe wanted to share. Poland wants all the benefits of EU while picking and choosing how committed to EU they are.
662	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf2Q9novjs	Poland is really heroic--such amazing people!!! Thank you so much for being so generous!!!
663	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf2Q9novjs	Ukrainians are white people, that changes everything in Europe. They will get a more privileged support than dark-skinned refugees. Even in times like this racism will always prevail.
664	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf2Q9novjs	It seems that there is not much response from western European nations to assist in the relocations of the refugees at least not it the news and perhaps not yet. I hope that these nations will be as effective in their response to the current crisis as they were in the Syrian refugee crisis which they were so critical of Nations such Poland and Hungary for not allow these refugees to cross their boarders.

The people of Poland will eventually get tired of being crowded and overrun and will relocate all Ukrainians to other countries.
681	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf2Q9novjs	EU is fkked UK, US and AUS are surroounded by oceans so refugees can’t reach easily. Thus the refugee load is going to break the spine of EU. 🍺

703	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	She’s asking why and the media’s reaction and Congress condemnation of the withdraw is exactly why. You make money of war and the sad thing is I see such a push from media to want to stay. Agreed there could have been a better way to withdraw but to stay why? Nope
704	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	There’s a reason they aren’t letting the trapped Americans and supporters get past the checkpoints to the airport. They’re going to round them up then create the worst 20th anniversary of 9/11 massacre of infidels. Then when allied forces retaliate against them China, Russia, and North Korea will instigate WW3 since China released the virus to mess up the world it’s all part of the plan. The US will be screwed with king potato at the wheel.
705	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	To all the veterans of Afganistan. God bless you. Biden can kiss my ass.
706	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	This was all in vain. It’s going to be a hard lesson to learn.
707	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	My brother died in the 3rd week of the Korean War. That experience was, as you would assume, terrible. But he died fighting the North Koreans, the enemies of freedom, as they sought to create a communist Korea. Another brother and I served during the Vietnam War to resist the growth of communism. Those who died in Afghanistan have bought time as we work to resist and resolve global religious terrorism. This is a defensive war against a continuously attacking enemy who intends to convert us to his way of life. Most Americans choose freedom over an alien way of life that they intend to force upon us. Those who died did not “die for nothing” and it would be a mistake to believe that. Those that attack us use time and persistence as weapons. We did not choose this war but we cannot sit by passively and accept a national loss of our liberty. More American’s will die before this is over. Understand the reason for the loss of these lives, and honor their service and sacrifice. Freedom is not free and the coin of the realm is our blood. Believe me, I know how true that is. I learned that very bitter and heart wrenching lesson in July of 1950.
708	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	And how many of you voted for Biden ? =) If you did, you are part of the problem .
709	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	I support the pullout. The Afghan governments collapse was inevitable and staying longer would be pointless. What I don’t support was the absolute haphazard and careless way we did pullout. Abandoning military equipment, citizens and allies without any protection was wrong and we should’ve took them all out along with the troops.
710	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	This should be a strong message for young American men and women thinking of military service. Forget it.
711	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	My brother died overseas. This government is a complete joke. We left all that equipment over there like a gift to the Taliban. RIP TREVOR PINNICK 1/6/92-6/12/12
712	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	Please please blur the faces of our Afghan allies. 🙏🏼 You may be exposing them to more danger.😭💔
713	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	It should be difficult and heartbreaking your sons and daughters fought a war based on lies.
714	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	It's sad but we can't keep throwing good money after bad.
715	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hp-cQ6MJM	No more soldiers should die in Afghanistan, get the American citizens out first and if we can help our allies. 20 years an trillions of dollars wasted, Afghans don’t want to fight the Taliban, why should the us?

817	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbCNS5_Eoko	I think ISIS is biting off WAY more than it can chew. It's basically saying ''Hey! We're going to attack you. you and you!'' They are basically declaring war on 3 big nations, all of which could fuck them up. ISIS, as far as I can tell, is not that big. U.S alone could take out ISIS. All we have to do is get France, Russia, and the U.S to attack ISIS's capital, or their home base, wherever the leader is residing. All 3 of these nations together at the same time could make mincemeat of ISIS.

I wish anyone could show me that I'm wrong, or why no one says that: The earth cannot be heated or cooled significantly while there is water and ice. The energy only changes one into another. But some videos say that roughly half the ice area remains in the Arctic over the past 50 years. If everything written above is correct, it means that soon, no more than 15 years, during the last days of summer we will enjoy many extra degrees, which will end our wonderful world.

But we were shocked as the complete opposite happened! Instead of reducing the climate disasters the intensity of the climatic war causing floods and hurricanes has increased all around the world like never before so Coronavirus has destroyed the global warming theory since the Paris climate agreement was not applied ;given that they have agreed upon reducing 50% of factories exhausts, but Coronavirus has reduced them by 100% for many months due to the quarantine and mass lockdown; on the other hand, the intensity of climatic disasters unprecedentedly increased since 2020 till now; hence the global warming theory has failed O Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, your statements about different matters are verified on actual reality, and those who follow them know this as you have been denying and disbelieving in the global warming theory for more than 16 years, and said that the planet of fire, Saqar, is approaching the Earth and affecting it from a distant place and you have written many statements concerning this matter but we still have not believed you and we believed the global warming theory that then has failed! So could you extract from the Great Quran what proofs that virus corona was sent by Allah to verify your fatwa to demolish the global warming theory as it will force us to stop our factories and wheel of carbonic life for many months, then, it raises the intensity of the unprecedented climate war to destroy the global warming theory?"" Then, I reply to the questioners and say: you shall find the news in the word of Allah the Exalted: {But those who deny Our signs - We will progressively lead them [to destruction] from where they do not know.

861	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvOeWJTbc84	Honestly any BBC drivel on climate change is just that, BBC should use taxpayers money not to be a biased political movement against the majority of views from ordinary citizens. the joke that co2 of 0.0014% is doing anything more than a small contribution to the greenhouse effect is beyond belief, Any actual independent physicist looking at real data from satellite and balloons can only laugh at this political motivated hysteria, But we rarely get any coverage of that BBC Richard Lindzen ,John Christy ,William Happer, Mckitrick, and many more

872	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvOeWJTbc84	Guess it's more precipitation and more freezing that pushes glacier to the ocean? Glacier don't move when it is weak, it moves, brakes and thawes when it is pushed by growing masses.
873	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvOeWJTbc84	They are melting the ICE and fracturing the ICE Every time they drill into the Ice . .I believe the biggest concern is if all the moisture in the air is condensed an entire surface of Earth would be covered and one foot of water ( 1' ) of water
874	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvOeWJTbc84	did you hear what she started off by saying a very massive large floating section is going to break off or can break off. so what if it's floating it's already displaced all of its water surface area most of the Shelf is floating it extends out into the ocean that's why the .the iceberg calving happens. because it wants to float up and break off of the Shelf. so no concern here.
875	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvOeWJTbc84	BBC did not tell its viewers about Antarctica's sea ice reaching the highest extent on satellite record in winter 2021 (Northern Hemispheric summer 2021), and now they find one place in Antarctica 1 week away from its summer equinox to sound alarms about special thermometers at one special place there potentially reaching their highest recorded temperatures since such records with such instruments potentially began dozens of years ago.

(LDE)136.4..Pope Francis I is The Beast of Revelation 17..The Eight King-..""The 1st Beast meaning in Revelation 17&13 is the Head of the Church who dictates the Kings of the Earth or State.Fearful is the issue to which the world is to be brought. The Kings of the Earth,uniting to war against The Lamb and the commandments of God, will decree that “all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond” (Revelation 13:16), shall conform to the customs of the church by the observance of the false sabbath. All who refuse compliance will be visited with civil penalties, and it will finally be declared that they are deserving of death. But the Lamb shall overcome them because He is Lord of lords and King of kings..The 7 Last Plague will come..Revelation 16 &Isaiah 24.https://youtu.be/n31h1ACrUDA In the final persecution(Sunday Law)of the Holy Roman Church, there will sit [i.e., as bishop]. Peter the Roman( Pope Francis I), who will feed his sheep in many tribulations( Climate Change,Covid-19), and when these things are finished, the city of seven hills [i.e. Rome] will be destroyed( Seven Last Plague), and the dreadful judge will judge his people.

990	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgEMapBF09U	Pope Francis is making a mistake in his thinking. Money is not evil and poverty is not good. Poverty is misery and money can help advance the world and the individual. Money is not evil. Greed is evil. Poverty is not Godly . Poverty is misery and not to be desired. Live a simple life is not the answer either. Farmers live simple lives. God gave man kind the creative forces to create and those creations are there to make everyone’s lives easier and more comfortable. To discard these comforts in the name of simplicity or simpler lives is not the way forward. It is not Gods intention at all.

1039	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgEMapBF09U	"*Taken from the original document found in the archives of the Library Of Congress in Washington DC, USA. My son, heretofore you have been taught to act the dissembler: among Roman Catholics to be a Roman Catholic, and to be a spy even among your own brethren; to believe no man, to trust no man. Among the Reformers, to be a Reformer; among the Huguenots, to be a Huguenot; among the Calvinists, to be a Calvinist; among other Protestants, generally to be a Protestant; and obtaining their confidence, to seek even to preach from their pulpits, and to denounce with all the vehemence in your nature our Holy Religion and the Pope; and even to descend so low as to become a Jew among Jews, that you might be enabled to gather together all information for the benefit of your Order as a faithful soldier of the Pope. (Here is the order to deliberately and maliciously infiltrate and deceive) You have been taught to plant insidiously the seeds of jealousy and hatred between communities, provinces, states that were at peace, and to incite them to deeds of blood, involving them in war with each other, and to create revolutions and civil wars in countries that were independent and prosperous, cultivating the arts and the sciences and enjoying the blessings of peace; to take sides with the combatants and to act secretly with your brother Jesuit, who might be engaged on the other side, but openly opposed to that with which you might be connected, only that the Church might be the gainer in the end, in the conditions fixed in the treaties for peace and that the end justifies the means. (Here is the order to engage in sedition/treachery in order to divide and conquer) You have been taught your duty as a spy, to gather all statistics, facts and information in your power from every source; to ingratiate yourself into the confidence of the family circle of Protestants and heretics of every class and character, as well as that of the merchant, the banker, the lawyer, among the schools and universities, in parliaments and legislatures, and the judiciaries and councils of state, and to be all things to all men, for the Pope's sake, whose servants we are unto death. You have received all your instructions heretofore as a novice, a neophyte, and have served as co-adjurer, confessor and priest, but you have not yet been invested with all that is necessary to command in the Army of Loyola in the service of the Pope. You must serve the proper time as the instrument and executioner as directed by your superiors; for none can command here who has not consecrated his labours with the blood of the heretic; for ""without the shedding of blood no man can be saved"". Therefore, to fit yourself for your work and make your own salvation sure, you will, in addition to your former oath of obedience to your order and allegiance to the Pope, repeat after me: (Here is the order to engage in spying and covert data gathering whilst treacherously deceiving hospitable hosts)"

Seriously, what is the point of this specific Olympics when most people are against it? Winning a gold medal seems superficial and pointless because nobody cares, nobody watches. Isn't that one of the reasons why athletes compete? To compete representing their countries, and 'bring pride' by winning in their sport. In my opinion, it is not only unfair for the JPN people but also the athletes, they have been training their all to get that gold that only happens once in four years but now that certain gold is meaningless when they can't even actually compete with the best of the best because some top players won't attend.

1097	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpBD7QGR_xU	Not a booster, just a 3rd dose of the same vaccine they have been using from day dot!
1098	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpBD7QGR_xU	Hi, I’m sure you’ve heard about us, and I doubt it’s been very nice things. We are the ‘anti vaxxers’, we are the ‘conspiracy theorists that you were warned about. We are the ‘dangerous’ and ‘unhinged’ and the ‘mentally unstable. We are the ‘uneducated’ and the ones spreading ‘misinformation’. First of all, if you’ve found yourself reading this after the recent announcement, I’m sure you’re feeling an array of emotions. You’ll be angry, upset, disappointed and possibly even scared. I mean, the chances are, you’ve had 2, maybe even 3 vaccines and yet you’re still being told you have to wear a mask, social distance and another lockdown hasn’t been ruled out (unfortunately, a lockdown is defo coming). Since March 2020, you’ve socially distanced, you’ve worked from home, you haven’t seen your friends and family, you’ve possibly missed out on life-changing events like visiting a terminally ill family member in hospital, cancelling a wedding, having to miss a funeral or being unable to go and visit relatives. You may have missed out on nearly 2 years worth of memories - grandchildren are now that bit older, elderly family members have passed away, your important family events have been and gone. I’m sure your mental health hasn’t been too great either. You’ve probably been feeling very vulnerable, scared and lonely - after all, you’re protecting yourself and others from a virus that you believe is killing millions of people. You hate wearing a mask but you don’t want to pass C** onto a vulnerable person, so you suck it up and you continue to wear it. You had your first vaccine, despite still having to isolate when your work colleagues test positive and still having to wear a mask. It made you feel very unwell, you may have had flu-like symptoms but hey, you were doing it for all of us. Then you got your second vaccine which made you feel worse, but you needed it so you could go on holiday this last summer - then what happened? They implemented a travel ban. You spent a year and a half obeying rules and doing exactly what you were told to gain your freedom back, only to be told you STILL had no more rights than the unvaccinated. In fact, you were told it was the unvaccinated who was prolonging this nightmare. The sooner everyone gets vaccinated, the quicker we can return to normal. Let’s skip a few more months and another variant has come to fruition - this one apparently may avoid the vaccines that you thought were protecting you - if you or anyone you know comes into contact with it, you still have to isolate, despite being vaccinated. The media are pushing this one hard - this is more deadly, more transmissible and more feared than any other variant before. Just as you thought things were getting back to normal, it’s like Groundhog Day. So, here we are 21 months in and you’re now starting to question things. We now have more positive cases per day than this time last year, yet tens of millions are vaccinated? And how dare your own government have a large Christmas party whilst YOU stuck to the rules. YOU weren’t able to see family. YOU weren’t able to go to see your parents in the care homes. YOU weren’t able to get your needed treatment in the hospital. YOU weren’t able to live your life and YOU was the one suffering the negative effects of THEIR rules. The thing is, 21 months ago, we predicted all of this. It’s not because we are ‘conspiracy theorists’ but because we have researched our government, we have analysed them, we KNOW them and we know their plans. I promise you that your compliance is only going to prolong this. You may think that we are crazy and selfish for not getting vaccinated, but what the media and the government want, is us divided. Part 2 For what it’s worth, I don’t think you’re a sheep, I don’t think you’re asleep, I don’t blame you for being compliant… but I am sorry. I’m sorry that you’ve blindly put trust and faith in a government that has let you downtime and time again. I’m sorry that you did exactly what you believed would be best and nothing has changed. I’m sorry that you did all of this selflessly because you wanted to keep others safe and you wanted your life back. I’m sorry that you were lied to. I don’t want their divisive techniques to work anymore. I’m asking you to stand with us and say NO to any more rules, any more lockdowns and any more ridiculous mandates. This is not about saving lives, this is not about keeping people safe and it is not about a virus. If you have a ‘conspiracy theorist’ friend in your life who has been right multiple times in the last 21 months, I’m begging you, to please take a look at what is happening now and see that this isn’t going to get any better until we make it stop. So, to you, fellow human being - someone who is clearly so compassionate to put their life on hold for 21 months, please try and spread your compassion and empathy to us and realise that we are NOT the enemy. Please copy and paste if useful.👍

1170	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpBD7QGR_xU	So this variant comes from South Africa right? Wasn't it at the beginning of the year when there was the Indian variant and there was originally a South African variant in January-March ? Have they just decided to promote South African to Omicron (Ripping off Futurama's Omicronians....Google it if unsure) so they can just distract the UK once again from the problems of BREXIT which is quietly again causing issues which will pop up again in a couple of months as supply issues are again on the rise which the UK people are unaware of. Media is loving this...Government just want control and power (clapping outside your doors like Sheep for the NHS) meanwhile people are still believing this bumbling clown in current power. Its all about money and why is it China (the original place of where it came from) hasn't had anything to do with Omicron? coincidence?

1176	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpBD7QGR_xU	In other news… South African Doctors are saying that the variant is mild and the health services are not overwhelmed.
1177	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpBD7QGR_xU	So if Omicron is basically harmless and it's all people are getting now, according to their narrative, then the pandemic is over, isn't it?

The country is awash with ordnance stored in civilian areas . And this is what you get . Hezbollah is the ‘elephant in the room’ , whom no one dares mention. You allow terrorists ( sorry freedom fighters) to run your country and this is what you get .

1453	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	We all are collectively responsible for all this. We don't care about our surroundings, unless it bothers us. Innocent die, & we all feel bad & we rememeber for few days & then forget about it. Then another tragedy happens. But it is just insane for the families who have suffered this loss. No one can overcome their feeling of loss and hoplessness. The thing is we, the people, have the power to change, stand up for our rights & together only a change can be possible. But we also have to give up a lot in the process and accept that change. Are we prepared for using natural alternatives in our day to day lives rather than chemical and toxins? Companies, manufacturers and governments will keep on giving us what WE demand that makes our lives easy, but what about the side effects that are attached to these things. Are we even noticing it, or are we ignoring becoz we are busy with our lives?

Oklahoma was only about 2 tons. 6 years. And it wasn’t for farming. More over....it’s 300,000 refugees. The World is coming together in peace accords and Chinas down fall. Many don’t see it. Others do. Buisness already has! Beruit Like Hiroshima must...will rebuild. There’s always been a Beruit. Hopefully it’s known for its changing of Lebanon.....into the city of life.

1500	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	I despise the way the BBC always try to make everything political. This is down to businessmen trying to get away with poor adherence to regulations of the storage of hazardous materials. Go after the company first, and then, if it becomes clear that there were people in high places who were paid to allow this to happen, then you can go after them...!!

1510	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	Why no victims of the blast are suing the corrupt governors for what they did until now? Their personal savings account must have many tons of stolen money derived from many years of bribery. Correct?

1512	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	It wasn’t fertilizer, it was ammonium nitrate for mining explosives. Get it right.
1513	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	Prayers and thoughts with the Lebanese people. I think it’s obvious that Hezbollah are behind a significant proportion of Lebanon’s woes. Perhaps part of their vast weapons cache were stored there at the port. An independent investigation should determine this. If international aid and rebuilding occurs now without destroying Hezbollah first, it will all be in vain and a waste, as they will definitely cause another conflict with Israel which would devastate Lebanon yet again. Best to rebuild Lebanon again, politically and economically, by eliminating the root causes of their problems. Otherwise another conflict in the region will have utter devastating consequences on the entire region, which will filter into the global arena and perhaps instigate World War 3.

1525	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	Dear BBC, when you write 'Anatomy of the Explosion' your viewer thinks you'll get into more details about the explosion. In this video you show us how the explosion affected people of Beirut from their perspective. While the video is interesting, it is definitely not the 'Anatomy of the Explosion'. You should have called it something like 'Explosion - personal stories' or something else in that strain.
1526	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	looks like TNT that was 100% a bomb

1537	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	"How does anyone outside of Lebanon 'KNOW' the Ammonium nitrate wasn't ""safely stored""?? How do the BBC journalists writing this voice-over 'KNOW' it wasn't deliberately detonated by an enemy of Lebanon? All these personal stories have NOTHING to do with the cause of the explosion or who benefited from it. These stories are to emotionally affect and thus emotionally manipulate the viewers in to accepting the BBC's bullshit that Lebanese people don't ""trust their government"" and that their ""system"" is ""rotten"". This is BBC propaganda. Western interference."

1593	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	For as long as I can remember, Lebanon has been dysfunctional. The current government might resign, but they will be replaced by politicians who are just as corrupt and incompetent. It will be *“deja vu all over again.”* Since Lebanon has no history or tradition of democracy, and its citizens openly embraces, praises, and condones corruption (e.g. Carlos Ghosn), I’m not expecting any significant changes. Hezbollah is also so entrenched in Lebanon that it is the true power. Lebanese politicians and businesses will kowtow to Hezbollah to remain in their grace.

1610	197	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG7mHUnW06Q	Is everyone now stupid? That was a nuclear bomb. I watched numerous different views of this.

Stand up and bring your country back to the beautiful country it was.

1724	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HTTgUMltww	_As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” And Jesus answered them, _*_“See that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake. And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come._*_ Matthew 24:3‭-‬14_ *_“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near._*_ Luke 21:20_ *_“So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place,(...)_*_ Matthew 24:15_ _Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation. And by smooth words he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will be strong and take action. Daniel 11:31‭-‬32_ _And from the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. Daniel 12:11_ *_(...)then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short._*_ Matthew 24:16-22_ *_“Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other._*_ Matthew 24:29‭-‬31_ *_Because you have kept the word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that hour which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth. I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, so that no one will take your crown._*_ Revelation 3:10-11_ _But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as indeed the rest of mankind do, who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose from the dead, so also God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus. For we say this to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17_ *_“But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming._*_ Matthew 24:36‭-‬42_ _Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking, following after their own lusts, and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation.” 2 Peter 3:3-4_ *_“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.”_*_ John 3:16-21_ Repent now of all your sins (stay away from all sins) and abide in the Savior and Lord Jesus, the Christ, (Yeshua the Messiah) with all your heart, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

For example, everytime i cant sleep, im listening to nasheed. When im stressed or having anxiety, i listen to nasheed. I dont understand a word but i can feel the calmness and waves of comfort in my body when i listen to it. I'm 19 years old and have been an addict to drugs and alcohol since i was 12 years old. I wanna change my life, and i feel like Islam is the way that will help me find peace and being a good person. I have done alot that i regret from the bottom of my heart. I wanna pray, but i dont know how to and i dont know arabic. How should i do? And i also dont wanna do something wrong.

1758	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ft01FotXFs	Islam is between you and Allah with no intermediary in between. Only Guides, Scholars are to be of assistance. Islam is a path of seeking the Truth. Judging others is not your job. Your job is to question Oppressors, not find escapism in women and what they are wearing. Only Allah judges the intentions, not you. Wahabism is unIslamic, it was spread by Vatican, which is a Satanic institution, and House of Saud, who practice black magic. The greatest evil is Oppression and Holy War is to be fought against such rulers and people. Basically all of Middle East is under oppression. But you are lost in the length of the beard. May Allah remove your veils of blindness, and show you the light, the truth.

Jesus' steadfast love endures forever. We may have trials and tribulations but Jesus will give you the strength and the courage to triumph over them. Turn to Jesus. Jesus is God Almighty.
1780	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKAhMltibk	From a German Christian✝️: I believe that whomever stands with those gone astray, those lost in the storms of this world, is a good man. Whomever takes them by their hand and opens their hearts to the Lord is thereby saving a soul; and who saves one soul saves all of humanity. I therefore honour all muslims who have saved a soul from hatred and fear. Let us remember, those of the cross and of the crescend alike, that we are all first and foremost brothers under the one true god. Deus Vult and حفظكم الله✝️☪️

Please everyone make dua for me that everything go smooth this time Inshallah. Please please please make a dua. I am really worried
1801	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	Im not gonna trust Allah for now
1802	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	your entire Quran is just a single person talking ...it is a first person point of view ...you trust that person only because he talks to someone whom he named as Allah and made him appear as a powerful entity. And your people believe these stories under his name, with a blind notion with no scepticism or whatsoever. ...For me Allah is just an imaginary creation with thousands of stories ..how much real, how much fiction ..no one can figure out,...because there are barely any evidence of his miracle that is witnessed by people (apart from the person who wrote your quran) ....For me Quran is not a Holy book, but a Fictional novel written by an author ...sorry ..
1803	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I really needed this right now, everything has been going down for so long, almost never was there an up in my life, but it was good for me because it built my character, it instilled the principles of honor, modesty trustworthiness, kindness, and compassion as well as patience wit people and a soft heart as well. Alhamdulillah.
1804	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I have a very important test tomorrow that will determine whether i get into the education of dreams. However its very competitive and last year i’ve failed and ruined 1 out of my 3 chances to get in. I promised myself and Allah I wasn’t gonna be disappointed with the result and just trust his plan for me. I may have cried on the day of the result and maybe a day after i felt a little down but i immediately repented for it and felt closer to Allah. I trust his plan and have been reflecting on my amazing blessed life. Everytime where i thought i would fail or was feeling anxious because life was hard i mentioned Allah and thought of Allah and instantly felt better. Now, i have my test tomorrow morning and this video put me even more at ease and i’m very grateful. May Allah bless you all and ease any hardship you may face. 🙏🏼
1805	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	Please pray for me, i don't have a close or easy relationship with my family. I have always been the elephant in the room because I'm the only man in my family. My sister's and mother don't understand me. I always end up overwhelmed and end up frustrated trying to talk to them and sometimes it ends up in screaming or me isolating myself for weeks sometimes months. I'm a good guy wallahi, and they're good people too. I just don't understand. Please pray for me.

Allah is with the right people, put your trust in Allahu teala <3 Selamun Aleykum brothers and sisters!

1823	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	It is difficult to continue to have a positive attitude when you continuously fail even after putting in effort. You tell yourself to keep positive but after being positive got you no where, you begin to doubt and become negative.

1837	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I'm a med student, i used to pass without too much effort, even people who know me well when they see my results and that i passed all the courses, they are like nooo waaay, how did you pass ?? In my last semeter of university i thought i'm super woman, i played all the semester and i read all obstetrics & gynaecology in less than a week, i wasn't even serious during that week, i got 54 but i failed because my university uses curving system. For me It was like the end of the world, i felt like i'm a complete failure and loser. I did the course again, the results will come out after 2 months. Insha'allah i will pass. I will never take things easy again. *I* *will* *aim* *for* *excellence.*

1844	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	Allah is not God, he is actually Satan the great deceiver. Jesus Christ is the son of God and is Lord!!
1845	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	It's like this video was sent to me from Allah (azza wajal) himself. I am a straight 'A' student, the type that cries over a 'C', which I never had to because Alhamdulillah studying was so easy for me. So the time came to write my finals and I failed, miserably. A student that has never gotten even a 'B' in economics since the moment she began offering that course got a 'C' (I consider a 'C' to be an 'F' in black/blue ink.) Physics my acclaimed favourite subject (which considering the how hard physics can be I usually will be okay with a 'B') I got an 'F'. A really big and bright red 'F'. However I have full faith that if Allah denies me this then he has much better in store for me. Allah has never in my life let me down or denied me of anything. I have never despaired in the mercy of my Lord nor will I begin now. I am preparing myself all over again to rewrite my finals and InShaaAllah make my future more brighter. I have confidence in Allah's mercy.
1846	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I don't believe on allahia
1847	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I don’t do well in my tests in school. I have problems in my life and in a way it’s been crushing me slowly bit by bit I say the eytal kursi everyday but some days i feel sad and lonely and as if it’s like I am the only one. And i see people around me doing well in school and I am doing bad. I feel like I am getting the difficult things and that everything i do is difficult I have barely had an easy task my failure is repetitive.
1848	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	NEVER trust Allah. He is master of lies.
1849	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I can relate to the example of the student so much that its not even funny. I pray to Allah that he guide me and make me from the ones who put their trust in Him.

1851	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	No, put your trust in God. Trusting Allah will hurt. Like really bad. Like literal Hell. You will literally go to Hell for worshipping Allah
1852	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I have the best mother in the world ❤ Alhamdulillah
1853	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I fail all my test...inchallah next time it will be easy for me.
1854	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	"a JOKE. A very BAD joke. Allah is a myth. Trust a god who never warned Muslims that Jews were coming to take their land back? Who never protected them in the war? Trust Allah who never moved against Israel so they wouldn't win the war? What foolishness to trust such a ""god""."
1855	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	"This is the worst video ever I can tell just by looking at it because there is no such thing as ""allah"" there is only one true God and that is God almighty. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son so that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. That means that Jesus died on the cross and in three days he rose again so that or sins would be forgiven"
1856	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I should take this occasion to share my story with you, i had asked allah for something (which i choose not to mention as it is not what is important) i wanted desperately, i asked him and i put my effort into it. it was not answered immediately but nonetheless i did not lose hope in my lord, in the end it took 6 years and he granted me my wish and i am eternally grateful to him. so never lose hope in allah.
1857	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	When I'm helpless... Will Allah help me
1858	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	What is the Nasheed played at the beginning and the end of this video?
1859	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	I have noticed lots of changes in myself after leaving all my affairs to Almighty, i went through very bad days, where i had totally lost everyone and everything, i was left alone in a foreign country, i was so stress and depressed that i wanted to quit life, so i started praying fardh and voluntary salat, reciting Qur'an, so i started feeling much more better and peaceful mind, now each and everytime i only thank Allah for every thing he had granted me with, i trust Allah and now seriously im in love with My Almighty...
1860	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	i am the type of guy who allah puts one difficulty after another aka always being so close to getting what i want and see it slide away. it hurts and sometimes i think god hates me and likes to see me suffer
1861	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	Please mention the name of nasheed , which is in background
1862	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	Allah (SWT) plz accept my dua..I have so many difficulties in my life.I can't take it anymore.plz Allah help me...Accept my prayer.Amin.

1867	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	allah made everything hard for me
1868	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	Things I learned today: 1. Allah makes different things easy for different people; no two people are the same. 2. When people get used to success, they forget that not everything is going to be easy, and that sometimes we will fail. 3. Those kind of people get crushed under one failure or setback 4. You have to remind yourself that your success is a combo of 2 things: Your effort, and Allah's help (baraka) 5. When things are difficult and you start believing that you will never succeed, you live life with a negative attitude. 6. رب اشرح لي صدري و يسر لي امري. If you have a calm heart, a positive attitude, tawakkul in Allah, and put in effort, Allah will make your mission easy. Jazak Allah khair for the video and may Allah bless br. Nouman. 😊😊

1870	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	everythings happened for a reason... Just put your trust in Allah. Put your effort in Allah and Allah will make it easy. inshaa Allah. Aamiin 😊
1871	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	i have come to realize that with Islam, it is easier for me to accept my flaws as a human being. we are not perfect. some people have amazing skills and abilities that we might envy. but it is best to think that Allah swt gave you something that makes you who you are. even if your talent(s) is/are not pleasing to you, be happy for only you know how to make it work!!!! i just finished completing a test, which was difficult for me. but alhamdullilah is all i can say!! and i am happy :) <3
1872	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	The name of the background rhyme?
1873	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	Sura 60:13 O you who believe, do not befriend people with whom allah is angry, and who are hopelessly stuck in disbelief. Do you realy think that if the quran realy was the word of god that it would be full of HATE. Why is hate filled blood thirsty allah telling you not to make friends with someone purely because they follow another faith, Why did allah make them follow that faith in the first place ?. Why is allah so STUPID and full of HATE
1874	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	Salam alaikum brother, thank you for sharing this video...very helpful...may Allah bless as all
1875	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	His videos give me strength to live and fight with the harsh things and shaitaan May Allah forgive us all...
1876	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	And this video makes me realise something i havent realised today..that Allah still loves me. He does everything He could for His servants but still, we dont put much trust on Him. Today i had a chemistry test and it was very awful, 99% students in the hall were saying it was tough and we had not enough time to answer all questions. Even the geniuses claimed that. But after watching this video, I know that i shouldnt give up. I trust Allah with all my heart. As long as He loves me, then I wont give up :)
1877	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	The key to success for any problem is your five times Salat(prayer).you take one step Allah will run to you.Allah o Akbar. Subahan Allah.

1881	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKwmbdPgl8c	It feels like I'm in a church. I am a friend of islam, & I like a lot of what he has to say. However, I am not compelled by his word to put my trust in Allah (may peace be upon him). Does anyone have suggestions for some on-line content; teachings of the quaran, etc...

I was a child sleeping when a knock outside my window. I opened the window and looked down. There in the dark was a river of fire and a small, cute boat resting against the walls and in the boat was the devil. Eventhough his body was red and he had a long red tail and horns upon his head, yet he was extremely handsome and had playfulness in his eyes. His mood was good and when he looked up seeing me looking at him he raised his hand beckoning me join him in his boat and go with him. I remember looking at him and refusing his hand, refusing the journey he offered. * lol. The dream was not scary and a dream of a child. It was after my conversion to Islam that the memory of this dream came back. Subhannallah. Hopefully it is ok i shared my dream.

I think if we had same name in Christianity to god instead of just god christians wouldn't have made fun of allahu akbar. Most of the christians only know about jesus but they forget the god in bible is same the allah.maybe we have some different ideas and theories on jesus but muslims respect jesus but we on other hand make fun of allah whose our own god Long live Christianity and islam ❤️

1961	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qIZ8mz9gXI	Mashallah lovely talk. But Sheikh so many people use this example not to pray. They say that they do good anyway and therefore Allah is so merciful when he forgives a prostitute for ONE good deed then why not them? When they havent done anything bad and just help people. They use this as a get out clause to not read namaz. I have explained that it depends on circumstances. We dont know how compromised she was and how majboor she was in her occupation. How can we compare to her, not knowing her circumstances when we have all the comforts and just expect Allahs forgiveness and mercy not to read salah. Please comment.

1984	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qIZ8mz9gXI	"Dear Brothers and Sisters, please read this comment! It will only bring you benefits, I swear by Allah! 1. It was narrated that Abu Umaamah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites Ayatul Kursi immediately after each prescribed prayer, there will be nothing standing between him and his entering Paradise except death.” 2. Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: He who says, ‘Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi‘ (Glory and praise be to Allah) one hundred times a day, his sins will be obliterated even if they are equal to the extent of the foam of the sea. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) 3. Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet said:“There are two statements that are light on the tongue, heavy on the scales, and beloved to the Most Merciful: Subahana Allahi wa bihamdihi, Subhana Allahi Al-`Azeem (Glory and praise be to Allah, Glorified is Allah, the Most Great.)” (Al-Bukhari) 4. Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet said: He who repeats after every prayer: Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah) thirty-three times, Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah) thirty-three times, Allahu Akbar (Allah is Greatest) thirty-three times; and completes the hundred with: La ilaha illallahu, wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shai’in qadir (There is no true god except Allah. He is One and He has no partner. His is the sovereignty and His is the praise, and He is Omnipotent)Will have all his sins pardoned even if they may be as large as the foam on the surface of the sea.” (Muslim) 5. Zaid ibn Harithah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: Whosoever says: ‘Astaghfirullaha al-`Azeem al-ladhi la ilaha illa howa Al-Hayy al-Qayyum wa atubu illayh(I ask forgiveness of Allah, the Magnificent, than Whom there is no deity, the Living, the Sustainer of existence, and I turn to Him in repentance,) his sins will be forgiven even if he should have run away from the battlefield (while he was engaged in fighting for the Cause of Allah, which is a grave sin in Islam). (Abu Dawud and authenticated by Al-Albani) 6. The Prophet peace be upon him said ""Whosoever recites Durood Sharief on me 10 times in the morning and evening, I will intercede for him on the day of Qiyamah."" (TIBRANI) 7. Whoever reads Surah Ikhlas ten times, Allah will build a palace for him in Paradise. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) exclaimed, “If that’s the case, then we will increase in our palaces!” The Prophet ﷺ (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) responded, “Allah is better and greater (in reward).” [Ahmad] 8. Whoever reads Surat al-Kahf on Friday, it will act as a light/protection for him from one Friday to the next. [Bayhaqi] 9. Whoever performs their ablution carefully and then affirms (their faith by testifying): “Ash-hadu an laa ilaha il Allah wahdahu laa shareeka lahu wa anna Muhammadan `abduhu wa rasuluhu; Allahumma-ja’lni min at-tawaabeen waj-a’lni min al-mutatahireen”: ‘I testify that there is no true deity except Allah Alone, Who has no partners, and that Muhammad ﷺ is His slave and Messenger; O Allah, make me from those who repent and purify themselves’ – the eight gates of Jannah are opened for him so he may enter through whichever of these gates he desires.[Tirmidhi] 10. Whoever says: “Radheetu billahi Rabba, wa bil Islaami Deena, wa bi Muhammad Nabiyya” – ‘I am pleased with Allah as my Lord, and with Islam as my Religion, and with Muhammad as my Prophet,’ Paradise would be (made) mandatory for him. [Abu Dawud] 11. Whoever asks Allah for Paradise three times (Allahumma inni as’aluk al-Jannah), then Paradise will say: “O Allah! Enter him into Paradise!” And whoever seeks protection with Allah from the Fire three times (Allahumma ajirni min an-Nar), the Fire will say: “O Allah! Protect him from the Fire!” [Tirmidhi] 12. Whoever is easy-going, gentle and kind, Allah will make the fire forbidden for him. [Hakim] 13. In Paradise there are rooms whose outside can be seen from the inside and the inside can be seen from the outside. Allah has prepared them for those who feed the poor, who are gentle in speech, who fast regularly and who pray at night when (other) people are asleep. [Ahmad] 14. Narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is a soorah of the Qur’an, with thirty verses, that interceded for a man until he was forgiven; it is ‘Soorah Tabaarak Alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk (Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion)’ [al-Mulk 67:1].” 15. Say this 3 times for 6 hours worth of reward: Subhan-Allah Wa bihamdihi, ‘adada khalqihi, wa rida-a nafsihi, wa zenatee ‘arshihi, wa midada kalimatihi(Allah is free from imperfection and I begin with His praise, as many times as the number of His creatures, in accordance with His Good Pleasure, equal to the ink that may be used in recording the words (for His Praise).” (Muslim)"

Our Lord says that, O who you believe do you think that you say , I believe in Allah and you will be left untested? It means Allah will test our Imaan in many ways.We should trust in ALLAH in all the conditions because Allah loves when someone places his trust in ALLAH.Allah loves and rewards those who have patience in hours of trials and those who thank Him in all the circumstances . May Allah make us from those who have patience and gratitude towards Him.Ameen

2011	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qIZ8mz9gXI	"Here are 7 tips from the Prophet (Sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam) to save yourself from Hellfire. 1) Performing 4 rak'aat before 'Duhr' and 4 after it Umm Habibah the wife of the Prophet (Sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam) : She heard Allah's Messenger (Sallahu 'alayhi wa salam) saying :""Whoever maintains four Rak'aat before Zuhr and four after it, Allah makes him prohibited for the Fire."" [ Sunan At-Tirmidhi 428, Grade : Sahih (authentic) ] PS : According to the scholars, the 4 rak'aat should be performed by 2 prayers of 2 rak'aat. 2) Fasting The Prophet (Sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam) said : ""Whoever fasts a day in the way of Allah, then Allah will move his face away from the Hellfire by a distance of seventy years"". [ Sahih Bukhari , Muslim ] PS : Try to fast some mondays and thursdays outside Ramadan in order to get further away from Hellfire in Shaa Allah. 3) Making a du'aa which will make Paradise and Hellfire supplicate for the believers The Prophet (Sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam) said :""Whoever asks Allah for Paradise three times, Paradise will say: O Allah, admit him into Paradise. Whoever seeks protection from Hellfire three times, Hellfire will say: O Allah, save him from the Hellfire.” [ Sunan At-Tirmidhi 2572, Grade : Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Albani ] The following dua'a are : *Allahuma adkhilni Jannat ul Firdaws ( 3 times ) *Allahuma ajirni minan naar ( 3 times ) PS : Try to say these du'aas in every prayers 4) Whoever has faith, prays and fasts will enter Paradise whether he fights in Jihad or not Abu Huraira reported : The Prophet (Sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam) said : ""Whoever believes in Allah and His Messenger, establishes prayer, and fasts the month of Ramadan will have a right upon Allah that he will be entered into Paradise whether he strives in the cause of Allah or remains in the land in which he was born.” [ Sahih Bukhari 2790 ] 5) Having a good behaviour The Prophet (Sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam) said :""Shall I not tell you for whom the Hellfire is forbidden? It is every person accessible, polite, and mild.” [ Sunan At-Tirmidhi 2488, Grade : Hasan ] PS : It means he is accessible to people, he is against harshness, easy-going in his character and generous in his personality. 6) Giving charity According to Ady Ibn Hatim (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (Sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam) said : ""Guard yourself from the Hellfire even with half of a date in charity. If he cannot find it, then with a kind word.""[ Sahih Bukhari 1417 and Sahih Muslim 1016 ] 7) Crying out of fear of Allah It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam) said: “A man who weeps for fear of Allah will not enter Hell until the milk goes back into the udder, and dust produced (when fighting) for the sake of Allah and the smoke of Hell will never coexist.” [Jami' at-Tirmidhi 1633] PS : The last part of the hadith is a metaphor for it being impossible, as in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle” [7:40]. Share this with others so that you gain as much rewards as them practising. May Allah save us from Hellfire. Ameen."

2018	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	Do you think as a mythology or as a truth. Because I am a muslim i don't know or Maybe because it's hard for me to understand this. I hope someone can answer me 👍👍
2019	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	Excellent explanation 👌 👏, this channel is very important to describe our ancient extreme knowledge of every thing to the world 🌎
2020	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	"Yes very well said , In sanatan dharma. We worship cow, animals , river , trees ,idols sun , movement of planets ,even our elders .. everything ..that is created by paramatma or bhagwan.. He is present in smallest of atom and largest of anything we can think of.. He is the energy who has different forms , through which we the, mankind can reach that very same energy.. In dharma worship means respecting the Parmatma/supreme for what he has given us . Without sun we cannot live , even without sand ,water, or animals it would be a impossible task for humans to survive .. The same forms are known as incarnations or extensions of bhagwan .. Many misinterprete and say we worship 300 million god by misunderstanding the term"" koti "" koti is a Sanskrit word which has two meanings like/ type and other stand for crore.. We often say Surya koti . It doesn't mean crores of sun ,it means like Surya (sun) .. Similarly their are 300 million types of extensions which God has taken in sanatan dharma not 300 million gods"
2021	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	Sanatan Dharma is THE knowledge , eternal and way to reach the divine and hence no boundaries unlike Hinduism which is just a geographical identity by Arabs and parsis which has nothing to do with sanatan dharm Many people misinterprete and say both are same ,but Hinduism represent s culture of people beyond indus valley but the sanatan dharma values have been reached the world millenium s ago which shrinked and become limited later till what we call akhand Bharat which included Indonesia Cambodia Malaysia Columbus Mexico Tibet Kashmir Bhutan srilanka Bangladesh Pakistan Afghanistan Vietnam Thailand Burma phillipness Japan and many others..,and then later shrinked to india and sourrounding nations and then later only till india and Nepal and now only till north india and south india That's a different thing that today sanatan dharm 🕉️ ✨🔱🕉️ is mainly accepted and followed in India and Nepal Yes no doubt that this santan dharma knowledge originated in India and sourrounding nations like theory of Karma dharma reincarnation life after death auyerveda meditation yoga and many more but it is meant for all the man kind ... Hinduism is not a religion it is a term given to identify people living beyond indus valley and around.. And it is sanatan dharm ,which too is also not a religion. Actually we don't believe in term or concept of religion .. The word dharma in Sanskrit and as per mahabharat and Bhagvad Gita means a duty and responsibility a person is bound too. Like we usually in dharma say a parent Dharma is to nourish and protect their child , a king queen to govern his /her nation following principles in dharma shastras ,Garuda puran and others. It doesn't mean king queen parents and child have different religion .. Like in Mahabharata Krishna taught that dharma should be saved and justice should always shine here he mentions that Pandavas were more wrong than demons as they were watching and bearing wrong and injustice happening for their wife and kingdom but still they didn't responded or raised voice.. Dharma in the another hand also teaches not to do violence first and also not to bear it and just silently watch it happening Hindus find god in every single thing that he creates ,he is present in smallest of atom and largest we can imagine.he is present in sand cows animals nature river sun tree planets moon every where Even inside ourselves we just have to find him through end number of ways ,it can be anything or any path
2022	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	Thanks for Real information . Because Some historians wrongly Translated ancient Hinduism Texts without logic and created many puzzles in Real information .
2023	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	Very well explained. 🙏🏼😊 your videos are necessary to transfer right knowledge in right way to young generation.
2024	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	I loved it when u said Hindu *HISTORY* not Mythology
2025	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	Awesome... Request if you make videos in Hindi too. This will reach out to lot of masses. It's great you use synonym Hindu History instead Hindu mythology
2026	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	This story has a astronomic truth, becouse when the universe was created there should be an equal amount of anti matter and matter. Were has all the antimatter gone? Is that was shiva have swallow?,in order to safe the universe?, or is the antimatter represented by the defeted demons?.
2027	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	One thing I like to point that planet and graha as very different meaning .
2028	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sid3Z4xm6uE	I think you should write web series on hindu mythology
2029	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Another rubbish video. The horse is symbolic of an unsteady mind. The person who controls and harnesses this mind is divine and pure. Kalki Avatar is a pure and divine being set to raise human consciousness not someone riding a horse with a sword. Not misrepresent facts.

2043	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I am Kalki Meitreya. I'm not a holyman. I'm a ruler. My character is a ruler's character not a holy man's character. I'm not traditionally holy. I have supernatural power's. I haven't been using my power's as much as I can use them because when I did use them in recent past 10 years ago the action's I did didn't have the outcome O intended. I have the situation of my life circumstances being not what I want them to be. I have been holding onto optimism that my life circumstances would change to become what I want. I now have lost my belief in my life circumstances becoming what I want. Due to that discontent, & frustration, & anger will likely grow in me. The result of that on myself will be my supernatural power's causing events on Earth in the spiritual world, & in The physical world. No human's support my spiritual life because all human's that I have who I am don't believe I have the abilities I have, & believe I am not who I say I am. With no support I am unable make myself peaceful to stop my abilities manifesting events. I will focus on creating a meditative mental state in my mind. I have difficulty meditating so it is unlikely I will achieve a meditative state. It ispartly the fault of follower's of tradition that I will upload my frustration on the Earth because due people rejecting current event's meaning, implications on traditional beliefs No humans believe in me, so human's give me support. I am completely alone in my spiritual life. What my frustration manifests as fro. my supernatural power's is partly the fault of all humans who call themselves spiritual.
2044	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	And believe it or not.... The description of the kalki avater mostly matches with the defination with the prophet muhammad (s). And he (s) predicted many things and most of them are coming true.
2045	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"Like sambhala, Makah also mean place of peace ... Prophet Muhammad was born on 12th ... Prophet Muhammad father name was ""worshipper of GOD"" and his mother name was ""Aminah - peaceful and gentle"" ... Muhammad was helped by 4 brothers, companions Umer, Abu bakar, Usman, Ali.. Muhammad ride a lightning fast horse called buraq given by GOD or lord shiva ... Kalki Avtar will receive wisdom or knowledge on a mountain’s cave from PERSHURAM (angel) similarly Muhammad recieved wisdom from mountain cave called hira and angel was Gabriel... cant u see all dots are connected ?? That your last god is none other then prophet Muhammad the last messanger"
2046	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"Sorry to you guys but i am giving you guys some startups point 1st of all Check the meaning of ""avatar"" The word avatar meaning from samsqrit is ( Bheeja gya ) But please don't believe me and go check the most popular dictionary 2ndly if someone is sended them there will be the sender Now lets strt the final chat Kalki faimly and place where he comes 1st father name Vishnu Yas Mother name Sumati Place of birth Shambala When will he comes?

2047	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"Kalki Avatar has already come & gone. It was Muhammadﷺ. Read the book ""Kalki Avatar or Muhammad Saheb"". Written by Sanskrit scholar. He proves this fact by references from Hindu & Muslim scriptures."

2050	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Vedic Prophecies In books of Hindus, the names of the father and the mother of Kalki Avatar are given as VISHNUBHAGAT and SUMAANI respectively. If we examine the meanings of these names we shall come to a very interesting conclusion: Take VISHNUBHAGAT. VISHNU (meaning God) + BHAGAT( meaning Slave) ALLAH + ABD (in Arabic) Slave of God = ABDULLAH (in Arabic) name of Muhammad's Father. SUMAANI =Peace or Calmness = Aamenah (in Arabic) Name of Muhammad's mother.
2051	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	HAHAHhahaha.... ...seriously tho ....I thought....it was Lord Shiva in charge of destroying stuff :p 🔱
2052	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	You'd think people will be aware of what exactly Dharma is after everything but no . My daughter said one day that I was contradicting myself asking her to lie for someone else's sake ,who doesn't even matter to us. It got me thinking , exactly what is Dharma? Lying to someone to spare their feelings or telling them the truth no matter how bitter so they can better themselves? Someone in this comment section said they are tired of living with us humans and couldn't wait for kalki to come ,isn't that wishing bad for people ? Is that Dharma? After everything,I think Dharma is just being true to ourselves ,no matter the beautiful lies or the ugly truth . Following our own principles as long as they don't hurt others. Let me break down everything in simple words : Dharma is live and let live.
2053	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I wanna ask he (kalki ) will come on mars ,because l don't really think so after 4lakh and 25000 years we are still gonna live on earth. (Not a joke please answer seriously ). Nobody answered me that kalki will come on Mars or not 😶 they're just saying humans will survive. Some humans will still live on earth and bla blah.

2078	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Your time calculation is wrong. Rama was the 7th incarnation of Vishnu and arrived 7000years ago. Krishna was the 8th incarnation of Vishnu and arrived 5000years ago. Buddha was the 9th one and arrived 2500years ago. Hence we can see that the Avatars came at a gap of roughly 2000-2500 years. Then how come the 10th incarnation will arrive after 4,27,000years? Is it possible? Think logically. The condition of earth was much better 2500 or 5000 years back than today's world then how come the last Avatar will come at a gap of 4,32,000 years? It's not possible.

But i have a guess that kalki might be kim jong un because the way he is going and leading the country seems like there is world war 3 coming soon. And all the atomic and hydrogen bombs will wipe out the entire human race.

We have to start changing urself first we can do anything nothing is impossible when we are possible ... I didn't believe that an Avtar can change anything it's in our hand... God created world we created caste etc good bed whatever it's it's our responsibility.
2097	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I have a theory that what Hinduism predicted as kalki is nothing other than a huge asteroids. Cause it's written at the time of destruction kalki will come down from north sky and it will look like a bright burning entity.

Muhammad Sa did the same thing in Makkah and Madina, don't believe me? Go and Google it. In his time there was no respect and freedom for women. There was no law on property. Who had power he could get all the opportunities and favors. Muhammad Sa destroyed that system. 👍Kalki will have sword in his hand. Do you think in this modern era a avtar will bring a sword and people will follow him? Seriously? It has already done my dear frnd. Muhammad Sa had his own sword of justice.

2167	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	And the Kalki is one in the SAME with the MaHDi in Islam, the Advocate in Christianity, the Maitraya buddha in Buddhism, and the Bishop in White in Catholicism. He will bring all religions together in truth before the greatest deception comes. Thursday will be his holy day because the 3 days of darkness which will reveal him and his rival the false messiah, will begin on a Thursday.

2170	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I don't think that anything is written about kalki in Bhagwat geeta.
2171	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	This is very interesting! Thursday is also known as Thor's day and Thor is also known to bring about the end of the world which is called Ragnarok in Scandinavian tradition. Very compelling similarities in both of these systems of belief. Coincidence? I highly doubt it since most polytheistic religions are all similar and most likely originate from same source but of course names and some other details will change and evolve over time in different languages.
2172	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Bhagwat Gita never mentioned about lord kalki, rather Krishna said whenever the sin rise to its extreme I will be born again .
2173	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Another name of Kalki Bhaghawan is 'Antichrist' or killer of kali because he will end kali yuga. According to Nostradamus Kalki Bhaghawan will emerge from southern peninsula of Bhaarath. There is enough evidence that Jesus is Kali and here see. Jesus said in Matthew 5.9 “Peacemakers will be called sons of god” And the same Jesus says in the same Matthew 10:34 “I came NOT to bring PEACE but trouble.” Jesus himself says ‘a nation divided will fall apart’ and 'a family divided will ruin' and knowing this very well the same Jesus then says i am here to divide families and nations - therefore Jesus is truly a ruiner! Luke 12:49-51: “It is fire that I (Jesus) have come to spread over the earth, and what better wish can I (Jesus) have than that it should be kindled? … …, and how DISTRESSED I (Jesus) am for its accomplishment! Do you think that I (Jesus) have come to bring PEACE on the earth? No, believe me, I (Jesus) have come to bring dissension” (religious non-conformity). Only KALI can say these things!

What if he was kalki avatar, he fulfilled all criteria for that, He spread truth like kalki avatar have to. He fought with swords. If so than what will be the reason when God will ask u why u not accepted kalki avatar even he came long ago, u will not have any exuce. Lol so research about it, if he is not than fine, if he was than u will get it by research.

He had also made an app for Corona detection & was in his mission of saving humanity & good. His brutal end, bought revolution globally and people connected with him on soul level. He stood with the sword of truth & by God till end to bring forth justice.

2221	192	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	One thing to note is that Kalki is not the destroyer of humans but the destroyer of evil. So he might just purify the hearts of humans and reinstate the rule of dharma.
2222	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	We're not in Kali Yuga right now. We're approaching Threta Yuga in about 75 years from now. We're now in the last years of the Dwapara Yuga.
2223	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Still how many days?how many months?? How many years should we wait for her to come? ...don't she think this is right time to come as here 100% sin nd bad karma reaching its peak🤦‍♀
2224	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Those claiming Kalki will come in our time, how will we actually recognise him, because seriously no one will really come on a white horse brandishing a sword. The horse and sword are just metaphors for new thoughts and ideas.
2225	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"I respect the hindus Christians all religions but i just want to make a point .. Allah created adam and eve and they were thrown to earth because devil (shaitaan) misguided them ..the devil promised to misguide the mankind which is the creation of allah (god) and since then hes trying his best to confuse and misguide the people.. then the mankind started to evolve ..the god has sent many prophets/messengers to the world at different periods of time .. and has send only one message ""believe in only one god who actually created you and follow the true path "" god sent the signs of his existence and truth through the verses of the holy scriptures some believed the message of god and many disbelieved..after passing of the prophets the devil worshippers changed the scriptures and altered the holy scriptures with many falsehood.. because of it many holy scriptures have many doubts and mistakes in them( with all respect im telling) because of this change in scripture many religions were created since the world began ...allah almighty send the final prophet muhammad (pbuh) and reveled the final message (scripture) to the people till the end of the world.. so because its the final scripture allah himself will protect the holy quraan ( scripture) from any changes and devils .. its upto us .. brothers with all respect just read and try to read the quraan with your language translation you yourself will know it is the word of god."
2226	197	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I didn't know in hinduism, there was Kalki, hearing at his history he seems to be a hinduism version of the Messiah
2227	198	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	But honestly Hinduism sounds so influential.. Like I have never heard of a religion which works for the whole world. To keep humanity. I love my culture
2228	199	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Do you know how many kaliyug years? Can you explain me now?
2229	200	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	When you said about Yuga calendar 432,000 kali yuga that line itself shows either you are brainwashed or brainwashing agenda guy. Don't even think that kali yuga is still ON as it is already over from 2012 and slowly emerges the Satya yuga now :)
2230	201	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"*I have no friend* So, When kalki will come..i will say *""Hey!! Can we be friends""* :-)"
2231	202	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"The prevalent misconception is that we are living in Kali Yuga. In the book ""Holy Science"" written by Swami Yukteshwar Giri, the Kali Yuga ended in 1499, and Dwapara Yuga started. The mistake was that yugas are a 24,000 year cycle, not 4320000 year cycle. The mistake crept at the beginning of Kali Yuga, when King Yudhisthira took all of his learned court and retired to the Himalayas, leaving no expert to perform the correct calculations. If we were still in Kali Yuga, finer mysteries of nature like electricity and gravitation, would be incomprehensible to mankind. Instead, we are progressing at the speed light with the internet and will soon see commercial space travel."
2232	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	And why is this God's always about violence
2233	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Why a sword? Who the hell fights with a sword these days or even in the future? Why not a machine gun or some other mythical gun?
2234	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I hope people know this is all allegorical and metaphorical. Its all about the revolution of consciousness and the expansion of the mind. Kali has come. The LORD Jesus Christ is Kali. The Christ has Been bestowed upon all of mankind. The Christ is the Supreme intelligence of God. The Second Coming of Christ is the resurrection of Christ within the Consciousness of all that seek God. That is what is meant by Kali Yuga. Christ Consciousness is the Supreme Personality of God.
2235	206	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	If kalki comes he will be crushed by antichrist or Yahweh (the only supreme God)
2236	207	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	But what it's impossible because according science trillions of years left to death of whole universe.

2253	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"KALKI is final form of human evolution i have thought this through and i read puranas as well i think final form of human will be like space jockey like (Flying horse with wings means modern flying machines), travelling throgh space and gaining new knowledge from different galaxies. As puranas does not say kalki will kill human beings but say it will destroy darkness with its sharp sword and it will restore light , and in ancient hindu text only knowledge is considered as light and ignorance as darkness.. so there are many theories but i strongly believe Final form of Human Evolution will End as Space human beings but not as Earthlings also earth will be totally unhabitable in next hundreds of thousand years..THIS IS MY OPINION LET ME KNOW WHAT Y""ALL THINK ABOUT THIS......"

2257	228	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	According to other calculations this already have happened, and we are 70 years away from the silver age. You only talk about miseries that other people is paying as a karma debt, but you are not seeing the worldwide awakening to spirituality and consciousness that has been taken place rapidly since the last 50 years. I have channeled the other day how all lightworker we have now small decimal parts of the gods DNA as a blessing. If you are right and we are still in Kali yuga, then all lightworker and spiritual people have incarnated as kalki by now. That's why we all have been under energy war and battles since the begining of this year. We will wipe all evil from this planet no matter what. Our love to the divine is growing day by day. Namaste.

2266	237	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"In his wonderful book, Pandit Vedaprakash Upadhyay, a Hindu research professor, claims that the description of the incarnation found in the holy scriptures of Hinduism actually belongs to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). .. The author of this book is a famous professor, a Hindu Brahmin of Bengali descent. In Hindu scriptures, Kalki is said to have been born in a place called shabhala, which means the city of peace, which means the Mecca where the Prophet was born, as well as the names of the father and mother of the Kalki incarnation, Vishnu Bhagat and Sumathi respectively. Examining the meanings of these names, one comes to an interesting conclusion: Take Vishnu Bhagat. The name of the Prophet's father is Abdullah, which means the slave of God, and the name of Kalki's mother is Sumati (peace be upon her). The name of the Prophet's mother is Amina (peace be upon her). It is mentioned that the main food of the Kalki incarnation is karaka and olives and is said to be the most honest and truthful person in the region. There is no doubt that Prophet Muhammad is praised for possessing these qualities. The Vedas (the holy scriptures of Hinduism) also state that the birth of the Kalki incarnation took place in an important tribe of that time. This is perfectly suited to the Quraish who included the Prophet Muhammad. Revelation in the cave - the horse God will teach the Kalki incarnation through His angel (angel) in a cave. Allah taught Prophet Muhammad through the messenger Gabriel (Gabriel) in a cave known as Gar-i-Hira. God will use the Kalki Avatar with a very fast horse to travel and travel the seven heavens all over the world. Burak (horse), Meraj (horse) And the night in which the Prophet traveled in the seven heavens. Born on the 12th lunar month Another amazing description of the Kalki incarnation was that he was born on the 12th of a Madhava month (Vaishakha). Prophet Muhammad Rabiul Awal (Islamic calendar) was born on the twelfth day. Kalki Avatar is a good horseman and swordsman. This is in line with Prophet Muhammad. Prati Sarag Parv III Khand 3 Chapter 3 Shloka 5 to 8 Bhavishya Purana. ""A Malcha (a foreigner and a foreigner) spiritual teacher will appear with his followers. He will have 4 friends. Prophet Muhammad had 4 friends. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was born in the desert. Kalki Purana 2: 5 states that Kalki has 8 virtues (Ashtasiddhi) Wisdom, noble race, self-control, divine revelation, strength, measured speech, ultimate gift, the grateful one all fit perfectly with the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). S) is the so-called individual. From this it can be understood that Kalki is the Prophet Muhammad himself. Kalki is the last incarnation of the Prophet Muhammad."
2267	238	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Only natural disaster, global pandemic can wipe out all human population .. Todays human population is above 7 billions to wipe out that population one by one in a second with a sword it will take several years, also in every second 2/3 new births added there is no way one can wipe out those entire population with the help of only one sword ...

2271	242	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	According to Kalki Puarana, Kalki’s father will be Vishnuyasha which means servant of God Kalki’s mother will be Sumati which means a Peaceful Lady Kalki will defeat approximately 60000 enemies Kalki will get a white horse Kalki will have a sword Kalki will be born in the city of Peace Kalki will go towards north and will come back Kalki will have 4 companions *Kalki was Muhammad* (pbuh) Kalki has already arrived Muhammad’s father name was Abdullah which means servant of Allah/God Muhammad’s mother name was Aminah which means a peaceful lady Muhammad (pbuh) defeated approximately 60000 enemies Muhammad (pbuh) had a white horse Muhammad (pbuh) was given a sword Muhammad (pbuh) was born in Mecca which is also called city of peace Muhammad (pbuh) went Madinah from Mecca towards north and came back Muhammad (pbuh) had 4 companions! And I do think that there isn’t any need of arguing on this!!! It is irrefutable truth!
2272	243	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	His name will not be Kalki Because If anyone borns with name Kalki All people will start to worship him from very childhood And kali is ending
2273	244	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	If we are nly at the beginning of Kaliyug that is a terrifying concept as the world is already in dire straights.
2274	245	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	This sounds like an extraterrestrial impact? Isn’t much Vedic teaching cosmological? Great video site. Hari Bol
2275	246	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Kalki also sounds a lot like Jesus as he's described in the book of Revelations by John the Apostle
2276	247	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	He is none other than Imam Mahdi A.S. he is mention in Islamic scriptures also😘😘😘
2277	248	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"you lost me at the ""Nostradamus was a great astronauter and everything he predicted came true"" 2:5o"
2278	249	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	1:32 This is what bible says how Jesus will be when He comes back and He won't wait 427000 years He comes when Moscow (and/or) Istanbul will attack Jerusalem.
2279	250	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Since Kali will appear after the emptiness of humanity in the world I want to be have birth of a fish and be blessed to see Kalki Avatar of lord Vishnu
2280	251	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	427000? Sure feels like the end is a lot closer than that...
2281	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"In Islamic mythology it is predicted that man is probably to be our last Imam i.e Imam Mehdi(a.s) after his arrival only 313-350 people will be left who have pure hearts and done good deeds in their life. There will be only two ""camps"" -beliver of Imam Mehdi(a.s)/Kalki and non believers of him. Don't take it other way, My meaning is to say that every religion mythology claims same person but names are different for the same man to arrive after no humanity is left in people's heart."
2282	253	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Go and read quran that kalki avatar is Mohammad
2283	254	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Booting.... It's myth ... It looks like someone copied from Thanos book

2286	257	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I think kalki have arrived in the world in form of corona. Man I am not joking think of it so many people have been dying . This is the end of kali yuga 😖😫😫
2287	258	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Islam is best religion....most important is that it is living religion...and its grow day by day ....directly or indirectly.......and in kalyug only true religion are gonna be criticised...that is islam that we see today ....we muslim have our own sharia law ....for every single thing ....that is the sign of good religion.......and when i think about hindunism...in deeply i find that Hindus are not worship GOD ...but they worship of there so called 5000 year of hindunism.....they worship there Sanskriti ....and when you ask to them what is base of hindunism.? ....they give you very complicated answer 😂.....like they started talking about veg or non veg 😂....killing animal , past life ( janam ) ....they judge there religion on the base of oldness....and most important thing is that they don't able to differentiate between mythology and history 😂.....same like Greek God ..
2288	259	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	what if 2020 is end of kaliyug ...? similarities are also matching !!

2290	261	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Search on Google:about when would the Kaliyuga end? It will end in 2025.😲
2291	262	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	432000 years is wrong data.. i have one question for the explanation.. ramayana occured in treta yuga.. mahabharat occured in dwapara yuga.. mahabharat is 5000 years old and ramayana is 10000 approx years old.. then on what basis kaliyug is of 432000 years as it is clearly mentioned that the next yug is of 25% less time than the previous yuga..
2292	263	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Satyug: starts with 100% virtue, 0% sin and ends with 90% virtue, 10% sin. Tretayug: starts with 90% virtue, 10% sin and ends with 75% virtue, 25% sin. Dwaparyug: starts with 75% virtue, 25% sin and ends with 50% virtue, 50% sin. Kalyug:starts with 50% virtue, 50% sin and ends with almost 100% sin.
2293	264	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Kalki will come humans will clean the world and the world will be dominated by Hindu's again.

2302	273	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	People say kalki has been born to defeat COVID.....but I think Corona virus itself is kalki
2303	274	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Kalki is going to join forces with Dhumraketu, the prophesised incarnation of The Great Lord Ganesha. And this is not happening in 4,32,000 years, it is happening very soon.. Ancient scriptures are manipulated. Don't trust them. Kalki and Dhumraketu has taken birth in India. They will end the reign of the Main Reason of the Kalyug, Kali. Kali is the ruler of all evil beings. He is the root of all evil. And he resides inside each and everybody of us. Lust, the greatest sin, is the main source of existence for Kali. Since we all have Lust inside us, so we have demons of Kali inside us. Illuminati is the army of Kali.

2394	365	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Date on which Mahabharata happened is actually not know so it is difficult to determine how many year left for kalyug to end. May be we are already in the beginning of the end.
2395	366	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	People at the end of kalyug will happy to have kalki
2396	367	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"According to me There is no such a special incarnation of kalki of lord vishnu , according to lord Krishna 's word in bhagvad Geeta ""yada yada hi dharmasya...."" It says that whenever the world is taken over by the adharma then kalki incarnation will take place ; now read carefully what I have written :- Whenever our path is towards the adharma some one will come to show us the right path he will endows us with the dharma(goodness) and will destroy the evil in us whoever does that is the lord Kalki"
2397	368	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Great video, thank you.xLord Kalki just has to destroy the evil Cabal/New World Order/Banking cartels etc etc etc
2398	369	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Disgusting
2399	370	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I think no Avataar will be there & Humans only will kill each other and became devil
2400	371	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Kalikki is Different in many religions. But its Aim is same... So its a true energy
2401	372	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	When kalki will come any idea?! I mean in this era of modern cars how can someone will come on white horse?! I wanna know for knowledge can anyone explain this i really wanna know!
2402	373	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Hello everyone out there. I am sorry if you feel my comment sounds offensive. My intention is not too hurt anybody's sentiments. But dear brothers and sisters I have a question to ask: In the era of mass destruction weapons, nuclear bombs, state of the art technology ladden supersonic fighter jets, and bio weapons can we still expect Kalki Avtar to come riding a horse along a sword in hand to wipe out all the evil from this world. Should we not look behind wether Kalki has came , did his part, rest leaving for us humans to do and left where he came from???
2403	374	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	You call him Kalki, we in the west call him Jesus Christ but the story for end times (mentioned Nostradamus) is THE SAME : )
2404	375	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	BUDDHA GOT THE LIGHT FROM TRIMURTY???? HE FOLLOWS AASEVAHAM???? OM PEACE

2409	380	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Is MODI Kalki?😳😳😳
2410	381	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"Just adding my two cents on Kalki here: . He came as silently as he left. But he left behind a vast treasury of new knowledge, a new interpretation of morality, revised and new systems of spiritual practice, a new interpretation of history, a new science on the most fundamental living particles in the universe, a new socio-economic theory, new knowledge on almost every branch of human endeavour necessary not only for our continued survival but also our accelerated evolution. . He is 5' 2"" in height. . He wears sparkling white traditional clothes and thick, black-rimmed spectacles. Look around. You won't fail to notice him even if he is no longer here. His extraordinary contributions to humanity in the 20th century are abundantly visible."
2411	382	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	This is bullshit. Waiting till everyone become insane and to destroy them..
2412	383	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Good God !! 427 000 more years ??? It already feels like the end of Kaliyug !!!How much more evil & corruption & suffering must be endured by all species of life for Kalki to appear ? ? We need Lord Kalki NOW !

2433	404	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Kalki-the horse rider... Will that be a real horse that we see currently? Or will it be a cyborg horse or a complete robot horse? We r aware that Kalki will end Kalyug. And as there are shortage of resources felt recently.. there r possibilities that humans will find the way to survive either robotically, or any other way.. but I doubt the wildlife will be existing around that time period.. they will be either in history books or no information at all.. only robotically alive n controlled. The same goes for Kalki. Will he/she be a complete human or a cyborg? Or will there be some other form of life for humans to survive their extinction? And what will be their personalities n nature? And yet we r still thousands of years behind to see that happening. So much room for too many changes in life n world.
2434	405	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	And here my science knowledge goes to dustbin 🤦‍♂️

2440	411	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Kalki could even be a whole new race of beings,and not just a single man. Remember,dashavatar means evolution; And Kalki is the final avatar. Just a thought.

2442	413	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Humans will lose their humanity and moral consciousness when human brain merges with artificial intelligence. All that will be left is western mode of intelligence that is based on only logic. We would be zombies without souls living without empathy, compassion, remorse, all those emotions that connects humanity together. And only a handful of those rich will be smart enough to stay out of it and control us with their technology. Kalki will be the one who hacks and destroys their technology and then them.
2443	414	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Bhai mythical kyun bolte ho sambhala ko? There are proofs of its existence. Goro ne brainwash kam nai kiya hai humara jo tum bhi bolne lage aise.

2445	416	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Feels like he will come in about 100 years. Considering the state of most of the earth now.
2446	417	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Thanks to the nature that I'm living in starting of the KALYAUG.. 👌🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

2448	419	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Kalki will not destroy whole Earth. A person similar in attributes to Kalki is described in the Book of Revelations of the New Testament. He is described as the King of kings. Mahabharata also describes Kalki as the King of kings.
2449	420	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Save Me Lord From This Stupid Kali Yuug 🙁
2450	421	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	We need Kalki now....
2451	422	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Humanity in such a long period will discover what its being to br concious and also earth will no longer be able to support life after a few thousand years and as a result humanity will spread aruond galaxies and will live in new home and at last after such a long time humans will be nothing less than god we will reach type 5 civilization which is god level and even if lord kalki comes to destroy us we will surely be powerful enough to defend ourshelves or there may be no need for kalki to come if humanity finds peace .so 'long live humanity'and long live India and her wonders'
2452	423	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Kalki is already here he is in cebu city..... the time was bent....

2454	425	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Judging by the pace we are going we will destroy earth within 2000 or 3000 years. I don't think there will be anyone left for kalki to save
2455	426	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Due to the Kalki avatar arrival, am happy that India will not be converted to islam country in near future.. 🤘🤘🤘
2456	427	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	In old temples kalkis face is shown as a long big face like aliens on horse and long lightening sword.. its not normal sword and he will not be born on earth.. he will come from the sky it means clearly that alien attack will happen on earth our ancestors have predicted future..
2457	428	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	"Damn! In the end of the video the way you said ""we really wishes he is out there some where"" sounds to me like you believe he is really out there somewhere at this period of time.🐏"
2458	429	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I think kalki will be made by human in the form of AI the most powerful and rugged robot because kal means parts
2459	430	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	I thought we had already reached peak of kaliyug.....Hard to believe how much lower humans are yet to stoop...

2464	435	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Kalki ji also watching this video and he is happy ☺😃

2467	438	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKa11G1Jpfs	Thanks for making this video Because people like zakir Naik lie always on our Hindu scriptures just to run there cult business of conversation Zakir Naik even clame that prophet mohammad is kalki avatar Where as there r many such points which completely deny zakir Naik clame But thanks a lot for the video 🙏🕉🙏

2473	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	As someone who understands the Hindu teachings of non-duality, there can be no possibility of time travel since time doesn’t exist in our reality or experience. What human beings perceive or experience of time is nothing more then a concept in their head of artificial time based upon measurements of day and night cycles and changes of the seasons. From that information we create measurements like seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years etc. But time only exists that way when you are thinking about it. So it only exists in one’s mind. The only time that exists is the present as in Now. For time to exist in the way we think of it as artificial time, there would have to be a past and future, which there isn’t. Nobody has ever experienced the past or the future, all anyone has ever experienced is Now. Don’t take my word for it look to your own experience. Have you ever experienced the past or the future? Have you ever escaped Now? As far as time itself is concerned it is eternally Now and that is it.
2474	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	If time travel exists then soul cannot exist logically. How would same soul be in different times if soul is indivisible and unique according to gita? Time travel is actually not possible otherwise someone from the future would have visited us till now. But aliens could exist , only thing is they are not a universe faring species or not yet discovered our solar system.
2475	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Now if tomorrow it is proved that general theory of relativity is false/incomplete, how would you modify your video? There is science, and there is *pseudoscience* . The last one is most dangerous. It gives an illusion of knowledge which is worse than having no knowledge at all. Moreover, just using a few cool *stock footages* , it is easy to make videos on *pseudoscience* . Watching pseudoscientific videos make people *logically numb* and *ADDICTED* to it. Viewers, be careful.
2476	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	There is no mention of practical application of time travel neither in modern science or ancient Vedic scriptures. However, in Mahabarata there is reference to Time Dilation. King Muchikunda, who spends sometime in Brahma Loka after his war with Daithyas, finds out that after returning to earth several generations has passed. Now, even if this is an imagination, the meer idea that time works at a different pace in different dimensions is itself a mind blowing concept to be written thousands of year back. And the question that we need ask ourselves is, what is their level of understanding about Time those in ancient times and where did they got that knowledge/thought process from?
2477	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	This is a lot of crapps and bullshitt in hinduism. Everything here is mythology man made hero worship.
2478	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Albert Einstein said that Time & Space are one and the same. That must mean that when we travel in space we are also travelling in time. For example, if you want to go from point A to point B and they are seperated by 1 km in space and 1 hour in time I think that means you will travel in both space and time.
2479	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Fake
2480	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	"Yes very well said , In sanatan dharma. We worship cow, animals , river , trees ,idols sun , movement of planets ,even our elders .. everything ..that is created by paramatma or bhagwan.. He is present in smallest of atom and largest of anything we can think of.. He is the energy who has different forms , through which we the, mankind can reach that very same energy.. In dharma worship means respecting the Parmatma/supreme for what he has given us . Without sun we cannot live , even without sand ,water, or animals it would be a impossible task for humans to survive .. The same forms are known as incarnations or extensions of bhagwan .. Many misinterprete and say we worship 300 million god by misunderstanding the term"" koti "" koti is a Sanskrit word which has two meanings like/ type and other stand for crore.. We often say Surya koti . It doesn't mean crores of sun ,it means like Surya (sun) .. Similarly their are 300 million types of extensions which God has taken in sanatan dharma not 300 million gods"
2481	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Jo indiase bahar ja nahi saka wo time travel karega🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2482	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Yes, it is possible to travel in space and time, but not by logic and reason or trance. It is possible by raising your level of peace, vibration, Consciousness of your own will if you want to do it as an independent one.
2483	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	This video contradicts, theory of evolution, logic, common sense(understanding difference between fiction and reality)
2484	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	A complicated explanation for a simple concept. Hinduism is the liberation from all lowly attachments including Time. Ignorant people may argue, but i've traveled innumerable times in future. Everyone has that sleeping ability.
2485	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	In Bible and in Quran u get the evidence of time travel... like people of cave , book of Enoch and night journey of Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) TO heavens... and much more....
2486	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	This was infact true during ancient times time travel, telepathy, teleportation was really day to day activity... Some how we lost this technology..So that Era was called golden Era!!
2487	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	nice work. make a vdo on mandukya upanishada
2488	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Every religion has GOD let's see little proof 😎 G = Generator (Brahma 🏞️🌌🌍) O = Observer (Vishnu👁️💖) D = Destroyer (Shiva 🔱🌙🎆♻️) GOD = I hope you understand 😎.
2489	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	If a few minutes in Brahmaloka are equal to millions of years on earth, as per time dilation principle, there would be an infinite amount of gravity in Brahmaloka, to give effect to such a time dilation. Maybe the Brahmaloka is one of the biggest black holes 🕳 in the universe.
2490	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Yup. The hindu script tell us about Time Dilation. It's totally different from time travel. Time dilation : 1 Mars hours = 24 Earth hours (example) Time travel travel 1 hour forward and 1 hour backward in earth hours.
2491	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Refti?
2492	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Can someone get this info to praveen mohan ❤
2493	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Time travel does not occur through matter. It occurs through consciousness. Ancient Hindu philosophers were masters of consciousness. We are hundreds of years away from their discoveries.
2494	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	"To all the foreigners who are watching this and thinking, ""If India had so much knowledge from ancient times, why didn't it become a superpower yet?"". That is because we were invaded and looted for more than 500 years, where all the scriptures were burnt, vedic schools and libraries were destroyed. The education system was completely re-written is such a way that the current generation only think by western standards. More than three generations suffered post colonial identity crisis and we still suffer till today. But yeah, we are now trying to revive our past glory and knowledge. Hopin for the best. 🇮🇳 ❤"
2495	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Same incident described in Sri Vishnu Puran 4th Part 1st Chapter 20-25th slok: King Raivat Kakudmi went to Brahmlok with his daughter (Revati) to ask Lord Brahma about her marriage. There 2 Gandarvs were singing Atitaan Gandarvgaan. He listened them for a moment then asked Brahma ji to choose a suitable groom among his own choices. Them Brahma ji told him that the time he spent in Brahmlok (1 muhurt) was equal to many Yugs on Earth and at that time Kaliyug of 28th chaturyug was occuring.
2496	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Yes it's true, Every human has a physical and energy body, Taking complete charge of energy body makes it possible to travel across different dimensions, many yogies and aghoris do it on daily basis depending on their purpose. One such yoga is called Astral projection.
2497	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	One more story of time traveling in the era of lord Krishna, where a warrier went to Swarg, to fight for Devta Indra, against some devils, when he came back on earth years have passed, all his descendents were passed away, they requested the lord to allow him to sleep for very long time in a cave,he woke up in era of Krishna, he burnt an devil by fire from power of his eyes while just waking up
2498	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	"I think you should add ""reference "" instead of ""proof"" because there's no evidence if it is real On top of that, I dont think it is time travel, the king and his daughter were just at a different place where time passed faster, they didnot travel back and forth in time. This story was already told in a previous video."

2500	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	There is a possibility to go to the future, but it's impossible to go back to the past, near the black hole itself time freezes n tats the end, when we talk in terms of gravity, but in terms of speed, in order to get back in time we need to go faster than the speed of light, n there is no possibility to it

2509	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Same goes with Muchukunda as well, he was virtuous king, and Indra sought his help in the war against demons.. And muchukunda went to devaloka and fought against demons.. And when war is over(in short span of time) Muchukunda wanted to return to earth then indra quoted the time difference, and told several centuries are passed on earth and none of his relatives are alive., then Muchukunda took a boon of long sleep and just slept in a cave, and in dwapara yoga Sri Krishna who is aware of all this goes to this king while trying hide from Kalayavana, who follows Krishna to the cave and mistakenly kicks Muchukunda who is sleeping thinking as Krishna and when Muchukunda opens his eyes Kalayavana burns into ashes from the flame of Muchukunda's eyes. Then Muchukunda gets moksha from Krishna.

2511	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	In Yogic state, time is believed to pass too quick. 1 day in spiritual world is equivalent to 1 year of earth time, something like that. So more than calling this a time travel, it can be said that is how spiritual world feels like.
2512	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	This was a much needed explanation for those who believe in time travel and don’t know about time dilation.

2514	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	This story is mind boggling. Where could they have travelled that a total of approx 116 million years passed by on earth. I mean physically traveling to a place that far sounds almost impossible. They must've Astral travelled.
2515	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	lol
2516	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	This is an example of time traveling to the future. Is there any such Instances of time traveling to the past? The reason I am asking is because modern science bluntly states that time traveling to the past is not possible.
2517	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	VERY interesting histories. So they achieved the time travel by exiting this reality, going to another, then coming back. All through the Power of God of course. Also interesting is that they are both giants that live longer. This is also depicted in other ancient cultures.
2518	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Not only king Kakudmi and His daughters time travels There are many Thousands of years old Ancient Stories in Hinduism . like Lord Brahma kidnapped Krishna Friends to Brahma planets , Lord Rama before his death dropped his Ring in Underworld and Hanuman understand Parallel universe theory , 300 Millions years old Garuda bell in USA in 1945 etc.Thousands of years ago Hindus scholars perfectly explained about Time travels . We want more vedio.
2519	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	Heisenberg stated, “Quantum theory will not look ridiculous to people who have read Vedanta.” Schrödinger, in speaking of a universe in which particles are represented by wave functions, said, “The unity and continuity of Vedanta are reflected in the unity and continuity of wave mechanics. This is entirely consistent with the Vedanta concept of All in One.”

That memory, is faulty in us all and it is is easy to fool ourselves. So you think this was real? Where is the proof other than revealed holy books?
2522	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EOfWTHBk	"In the movie ""Interstellar"", when the 2 lead characters spent a mere 3 hours on the planet near the black hole, was equal to 21 years of wait for their colleague in a ship which was orbiting the planet further away from the black hole. This was theorised by Albert Einstein in his general theory of relativity paper before WW2. This is considered very recent, when we ponder upon the fact that this was mentioned in our Hindu scriptures thousands of years ago. WOW!!!.

My guess is mahabharat and ramayan were kind of stage shows organised by kings in 1000 to 500 bc ( thats why they are still perfomed today as a show in ramlila) later it became a legend.

2571	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P596EkLY_9U	No Mahabharata war was happened exactly in 5662 BC . Plz study carefully if you study bhism nirvana and Arundhati and Vashistha star . Also flood in dwraka happened as u say 36 yrs after Maharashtra war this analogy is absolutely correct

2573	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P596EkLY_9U	But what if the birth of Aryabhatta was much earlier than calculated. It is said he was contemporaneous to Gupta empire which according to Indian Puranic chronology existed 300 BCE and Maurya empire existed 1500 BCE. The wrong dates propagated by the colonialists are not reliable at all. If the Aryabhatta was 800 years earlier then the year of Kali yuga start will also be pushed back.

2580	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P596EkLY_9U	"The Hindu metrics of time (Kaala Vyavahara) can be summarized as below: • a Lipta (लिप्ता) is approximately 0.4 seconds • a Vighati (विघटि) is 60 Liptas, or approximately 24 seconds • a Ghadika (घटि) is 60 Vighatis, or approximately 24 minutes • a Muhurta is equal to 2 Ghadikas, or approximately 48 minutes • a Nakshatra ahoratram (नक्षत्र अहोरत्रम्) or sidereal day is exactly equal to 30 Muhurtas (Note: A day is considered to begin and end at sunrise, not midnight.) An alternate system described in the Vishnu Purana Time measurement section of the Vishnu Purana Book I Chapter III is as follows: 100 Truti = 1 Tatpara 30 Tatpara = 1 Nimesha 15 Nimeshas = 1 Kásht́há 30 Kásht́hás = 1 Kalá 30 Kalás = 1 Kṣaṇa 12 Kṣaṇa = 1 Muhúrtta 30 Muhúrttas = 1 day (24 hours) 30 days = 1 month 6 months = 1 Ayana 2 Ayanas = 1 year or one day (day + night) of the gods Small units of time used in the Vedas • a Trasarenu is the combination of 6 celestial atoms. • a Truti is the time needed to integrate 3 Trasarenus, or 1/1687.5th of a second. • a Vedha is 100 Trutis. • a Lava is 3 Vedhas. • a Nimesha is 3 Lavas, or a blink. • a Kshanas is 3 Nimeshas. • a Kashthas is 5 Kshanas, or about 8 seconds. • a Laghu is 15 Kashthas, or about 2 minutes. 15 Laghus make one Nadika, which is also called a danda. This equals the time before water overflows in a six-pala-weight [fourteen ounce] pot of copper, in which a hole is bored with a gold probe weighing four masha and measuring four fingers long. The pot is then placed on water for calculation. 2 Dandas make one Muhurta. 6 or 7 Dandas make one Yamah, or 1/4th of a day or night. 4 Praharas or 4 Yamas are in each day or each night. LUNAR METRICS a tithi (also spelled thithi ) or lunar day is defined as the time it takes for the longitudinal angle between the moon and the sun to increase by 12°. Tithis begin at varying times of day and vary in duration from approximately 19 to approximately 26 hours. a paksa (also paksha) or lunar fortnight consists of 15 tithis a masa or lunar month (approximately 29.5 days) is divided into 2 pakshas: the one between new moon and full moon is called gaura (bright) or shukla paksha; the one between full moon and new moon krishna paksha a ritu is 2 masa an ayanam is 3 rituhs a year is 2 Aayanas TROPICAL METRICS a Yaama (याम) = 1/4th of a day(light) or night [ = 7½ Ghatis (घटि) = 3¾ Muhurtas (मुहूर्त) = 3 Horas (होरा) ] 4 Yaamas 1 half of the day (either day or night) 8 Yaamas 1 day (day + night) an Ahoratram is a tropical day (Note: A day is considered to begin and end at sunrise, not midnight.) Reckoning of time among other entities Reckoning of time amongst the pitrs. 1 human day = 1/30 day of the pitrs 30 days of human is 1 month of human = 1 day of the pitrs 12 months of human = 1 year of the pitrs The lifespan of the pitrs is 100 years of the pitrs (= 3,600 human years) Reckoning of time amongst the Devas. 1 human year = 1 day of the Devas. 30 days of the Devas = 1 month of the Devas. 12 months of the Devas = 1 year of the Devas The lifespan of the Devas is 100 years of the Devas (= 36,000 human years) The Vishnu Purana Time measurement section of the Vishnu Purana Book I Chapter III explains the above as follows: 2 Ayanas (six month periods, see above) = 1 year or one day (day + night) of the devas 360 days of the devas = 1 year of the devas 12,000 years of the devas = 4 Yugas Reckoning of time for Brahma. 12,000 years of the Devas = 1 day of Brahma (4320,000,000 human years). This day is divided into 10, 000 parts called charanas. The charanas are divided as follows: The Four Yugas 4 charanas (1,728,000 solar years) Satya Yuga 3 charanas(1,296,000 solar years) Treta Yuga 2 charanas(864,000 solar years) Dwapara Yuga 1 charanas(432,000 solar years) Kali Yuga The cycle repeats itself so altogether there are 1000 cycles of yugas in one day of Brahma. One cycle of the above four yugas is one mahayuga (4.32 billion solar years) A manvantara consists of 71 mahayugas (306,720,000 solar years). Each Manvantara is ruled by a Manu. After each manvantara follows one Sandhi Kala of the same duration as a Krita Yuga (1,728,000 = 4 Charana). (It is said that during a Sandhi Kala, the entire earth is submerged in water.) A kalpa consists of a period of 1,728,000 solar years called Adi Sandhi, followed by 14 manvantaras and Sandhi Kalas. A day of Brahma equals (14 times 71 mahayugas) + (15 x 4 Charanas) = 994 mahayugas + (60 Charanas) = 994 mahayugas + (6 x 10) Charanas = 994 mahayugas + 6 mahayugas = 1000 mahayugas as is confirmed by the Gita statement ""sahasra-yuga paryantam ahar-yad brahmano viduH"", meaning, a day of brahma is of 1000 (maha-)yugas. Thus a day of Brahma, kalpa, is of duration: 4.32 billion solar years. Two kalpas constitute a day and night of Brahma 30 days of Brahma = 1 month of Brahma (259,200,000,000 human years) 12 months of Brahma = 1 year of Brahma (3,110,400,000,000 human years) 25 years of Brahma = 1 kalpa (77,760,000,000,000 human years) 2 kalpas = 1 parardha (155,520,000,000,000 human years) 2 parardhas = 100 years of Brahma, the lifespan of Brahma (311,040,000,000,000 human years) The Vishnu Purana Time measurement section of the Vishnu Purana Book I Chapter III explains the above as follows: 360 days of the gods = 1 year of the gods 12,000 years of the gods = 4 Yugas 1,000 sets of 4 Yugas = a day of Brahmá 50 years of Brahma = 1 Pararddham 100 years of Brahma = 1 Param 4,000 + 400 + 400 = 4,800 years = 1 Krita Yuga 3,000 + 300 + 300 = 3,600 years = 1 Tretá Yuga 2,000 + 200 + 200 = 2,400 years = 1 Dwápara Yuga 1,000 + 100 + 100 = 1,200 years = 1 Kali Yuga Alternately, the reigns of 7 Rishis, Indra and Manu = 1 Manwantara = 71x12,000+A (A is not given) = 852,000 years of the gods+A (A is not given) 14 Manwantaras = a day of Brahmá VEDIC TIME UNITS GREATER THAN A KALPA Ancient vedic cosmology takes into account handful of time spans which are even greater than one Kalpa or a day of Brahma. One such unit is a ""Maha-Kalpa"" which is composed of 36000 such days of Brahma. One Maha-Kalpa is considered as the lifetime of Brahma. There are time units which are larger than one Maha-Kalpa. The largest of them has been calculated as several quadrillions of human years. This precise and massive calculations indicate one important aspect of vedic time system, that, whenever the term ""Infinity"" has been mentioned in Vedas, it does not indicate something very large. Instead, it appears that the term is meant to refer its literal synonym itself."
2581	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P596EkLY_9U	"The fact is that, Mahabharata time is even more ancient actually, And Ramayana time is much more ancient as ramayana happened at the end of treta & Mahabharata at the end of dwapara So see, This time is the transitional period for the beginning of new chaturyuga or simply the the kaliyuga's final phase of 28th chaturyuga. Please Read it till end 🙏❤🙏 So see, first of all we need to understand that, [(1 year of Devas = 360 Human Years) note:- time is different at different parts of the universe, and 'Devas' are the higher level of conscious entity than us, they have subtle bodies, not physical & it can be attained by us too if we go in deep through immense penance, because Devas belong to metaphysical world) So, Satya Yuga: 4800 divine years = 17,28,000 human years (Four times of Kaliyuga) Treta Yuga: 3600 divine years = 12,96,000 human years (Thrice of Kaliyuga) Dwapara Yuga: 2400 divine years = 8,64,000 human years (Twice of Kaliyuga) Kaliyuga: 1200 divine years = 4,32,000 human years This is the fact!! Also, let me tell if we converted 12 hrs of day into deciseconds then, it's result comes 4,32,000 deci-seconds. So, it can be understood that all these things are as accurated practically the way they are mentioned, it's the measurement of time. In addition, we all should know that, Actually, there's a miscalculation in the age of yugas. (Please read it all till end)🙏❤🙏 This is the reason why 'Bhavishyamalika' written around 500 years old by Mahapurush Achutanand (all predictions done in 'Bhavishyamalika' is happening every year) & several other Future predictors like Sant Ravidas, Nostradamus, Jay Gurudev including several foreign future pedictors; everyone pointing towards a same point about the ending of Kaliyuga with a great devastation, as it is happening also no doubt about it, with stating the arrival of Lord Kalki for the beginning of Satya Yuga. (Note: the predictions of all those astrologers are coming true, each event) So, it's not only about predictions, there are plenty of proofs about it too. As we all know, Dwarika City was built by Almighty Lord Krishna at the end of Dwapara Yuga ( in order to protect his people from the attack of 'Jarasandh') which is found to be much much older, from radio carbon dating of the submerged city by the archeological team it has been found that, the remains of Dwarika city are 32,000 years & even older including some structures of the city is 200,000 to 400,000 years old which is exactly the time period of Kaliyuga (4,32,000 years) (Note:- these findings are done in just initial phases there's still a lot more to find there, chances of finding even more ancient structures after further deep excavation in it) So, if we add up: 32,000+400,000 it comes up 432,000 years it's the total age of Kaliyuga that's why from these proofs it clearly indicates the Kaliyuga is in it's final phase & we are on the transformation period for the beginning of Satya Yuga also called as 'Sangam Yuga' Now, some people may argue by giving astronomical preferences ""No, it was happened around 5000, 6000 years ago"" some even say 3000 years old being in dillema so for those people: See, the same astronimical arrangements are aligned at the same positions every 5,000/10,000 years so everybody must try to understand these stuffs more deeply. So, Dwapara Yuga ended 432,000 years ago as according to these scientific proofs, this is the reason why we aren't getting the remains of any kingdom of that period because several external factors with natural calamities played a role for the complete loss of those remains. The dates & the dynasties that ruled between the time period of King JANMEJAYA (Son Of King Parikshit, who did Nagdahan Yagnya) and his descendants to the age of Gautam Buddha (Pre - Bouddha Age) is still in dark, the political situations, events between this period isn't revealed till now cause, there's a gap of vast timeline."

2620	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcJO3LDrWQQ	"Well it's written in the quran that the Earth was created before any of the stars in the universe which certainly is wrong cause as we know today that the oldest star in the whole universe is the methuselah star which is also known as HD 140283. Now this star is at least 13 billion years old and it's 200 light years away from us. And the Earth's age as we know today is 4.5 billion years old. So the Earth is at least 3 times younger than the oldest star in the universe. Now if you're wondering where does the Quran say that the Earth is older than all the stars of the universe, well then here you go Quran chapter 41 verse 9-12 the Quran says ""Say, ""Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds."" And He placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface, and He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance in four days without distinction - for [the information] of those who ask. Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, ""Come [into being], willingly or by compulsion."" They said, ""We have come willingly."" And He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing."" So as you can see, in these verses your Allah is clearly saying that he created the Earth before he created the stars of this universe by saying that he set lamps(stars) in the nearest heaven(Universe) after he's done creating the Earth. So yeah in these verses Allah is clearly saying that the Earth is older than even the oldest star in the whole universe. By the way there's one more mistake that I noticed is that the Quran says that plants can survive without the sun light by saying that he determined the existence of life on Earth before he created any star in the universe. As we all know the sun is also a star. So by saying that the Earth was created before stars, the Quran is also saying that the Earth was created even before the sun was. And since the Quran is saying that Allah determined the existence of life on Earth before he created the stars as Allah said ""He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance in four days without distinction"" the Quran is saying that plants were created on Earth even before the sun. Since plants have life too. That being said, the Quran's indicating that plants can survive without the sun light which certainly isn't correct. Cause we all know that plant's require the sunlight in order to survive and if you wanna test it then go buy some plants, take it home and keep it in a place where it's always completely dark and see what happens after probably 2 or 3 weeks. Trust me, the plants will die because of not getting the sun light. Alright that's all but yeah there are a lot more errors in the Quran that I've found but nah I ain't gonna mention them here. Cause I've been writing for quite a long time now. So yeah that's all."

Glory is to Allah. Praise is to Allah. There is none worth of worship but Allah. Allah is the Most Great. There is no might and no power except by Allah's leave, the Exalted, the Mighty. My Lord, forgive me. (Whoever says this will be forgiven, and if he supplicates Allah, his prayer will be answered; if he performs ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.) ‎2- اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي لَّا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ، وَأَنَا عَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ، أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ، أَبُوءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ، وَأَبُوءُ بِذَنْبِي فَاغْفِر لِي فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ O Allah, You are my Lord, there is none worthy of worship but You. You created me and I am your slave. I keep Your covenant, and my pledge to You so far as I am able. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done. I admit to Your blessings upon me, and I admit to my misdeeds. Forgive me, for there is none who may forgive sins but You.(Whoever recites this with conviction in the evening and dies during that night shall enter Paradise, and whoever recites it with conviction in the morning and dies during that day shall enter Paradise.) ‎3- اللَّهُمَّ عَافِـني فِي بَدَنِي، اللَّهُمَّ عَافِـنِي فِي سَمْعِي، اللَّهُمَّ عَافِنِي فِي بَصَرِي، لَا إِلَهَ إلاَّ أَنْتَ. اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُبِكَ مِنَ الْكُفْر، وَالفَقْرِ، وَأَعُوذُبِكَ مِنْ عَذَابِ الْقَبْرِ ، لَا إلَهَ إلاَّ أَنْتَ O Allah, make me healthy in my body. O Allah, preserve for me my hearing. O Allah, preserve for me my sight. There is none worthy of worship but You. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from disbelief and poverty and I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the grave. There is none worthy of worship but You. (Three times) ‎4- حَسْبِيَ اللَّهُ لَآ إِلَهَ إِلَّا هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَهُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ Allah is sufficient for me. There is none worthy of worship but Him. I have placed my trust in Him, He is Lord of the Majestic Throne. (Seven times)(Allah will grant whoever recites this Seven times in the morning or evening whatever he desires from this world or the next.) ‎5- اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ الْعَفْوَ وَالْعَافِيَةَ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ، اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ الْعَفْوَ وَالْعَافِيَةَ فِي دِينِي، وَدُنْيَايَ، وَأَهْلِي، وَمَالِي، اللَّهُمَّ اسْتُرْ عَوْرَاتِي، وَآمِنْ رَوْعَاتِي، اللَّهُمَّ احْفَظْنِي مِنْ بَيْنِ يَدَيَّ، وَمِنْ خَلْفِي، وَعَنْ يَمِينِي، وَعَنْ شِمَالِي، وَمِنْ فَوْقِي، وَأَعُوذُ بِعَظَمَتِكَ أَنْ أُغْتَالَ مِنْ تَحْتِيَ O Allah, I seek Your forgiveness and Your protection in this world and the next. O Allah, I seek Your forgiveness and Your protection in my religion, in my worldly affairs, in my family and in my wealth. O Allah, conceal my secrets and preserve me from anguish. O Allah, guard me from what is in front of me and behind me, from my left, and from my right, and from above me. I seek refuge in Your Greatness from being struck down from beneath me. ‎6- اللَّهُمَّ عَالِمَ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ فَاطِرَ السَّماوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ، رَبَّ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَمَلِيكَهُ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ نَفْسِي، وَمِنْ شَرِّ الشَّيْطَانِ وَشِرْكِهِ، وَأَنْ أَقْتَرِفَ عَلَى نَفْسِي سُوءاً أَوْ أَجُرَّهُ إِلَى مُسْلِمٍ O Allah, Knower of the unseen and the evident , Maker of the heavens and the earth, Lord of everything and its Possessor, I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship but You. I seek refuge in You from the evil of my soul and from the evil of Satan and his helpers. (I seek refuge in You) from bringing evil upon my soul and from harming any Muslim. ‎7- رَضِيتُ باللَّهِ رَبًّا، وَبِالْإِسْلَامِ دِيناً، وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ صَلَى اللَّهُ عَلِيهِ وَسَلَّمَ نَبِيَّاً I am pleased with Allah as my Lord, with Islam as my religion and with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as my Prophet. (Three times)(Allah has promised that anyone who says every morning or evening will be pleased on the Day of Resurrection.) ‎8- يَاحَيُّ، يَا قَيُّومُ، بِرَحْمَتِكَ أَسْتَغِيثُ، أَصْلِحْ لِي شَأْنِي كُلَّهُ، وَلَا تَكِلْنِي إِلَى نَفْسِي طَرْفَةَ عَيْنٍ O Ever Living One, O Eternal One, by Your mercy I call on You to set right all my affairs. Do not place me in charge of my soul even for the blinking of an eye. ‎9- سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ Glory is to Allah and praise is to Him. (100 times)(Whoever recites this one hundred times in the morning and in the evening will not be surpassed on the Day of Resurrection by anyone having done better than this except for someone who had recited it more.) ‎10- لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone, Who has no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise and He is Able to do all things. (10 times or once if tired.) ‎11- لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone, Who has no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise and He is Able to do all things. (100 times in in the morning.)(Whoever recites this hundred times in the morning, Allah swt will reward him of freeing ten slaves, Allah will write one hundred Hasanat and and forgive him one hundred misdeeds and be protected from Satan until evening.) ‎12- سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ عَدَدَ خَلْقِهِ، وَرِضَا نَفْسِهِ، وَزِنَةَ عَرْشِهِ وَمِدَادَ كَلِمَاتِهِ Glory is to Allah and praise is to Him, by the multitude of His creation, by His Pleasure, by the weight of His Throne, and by the extent of His Words. (Three times in the morning.) ‎13- اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ وَسَلَّمْ عَلَى نَبِيِّنَا مُحَمَّدٍ Oh Allah, we ask you for peace and blessings upon our prophet Muhammad. (Ten times)(The Prophet saw said: ""Who recites blessings upon me 10 times in the morning and 10 times in the evening will obtain my intercession on the Day of Resurrection"".) ‎14- اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي عَبْدُكَ، ابْنُ عَبْـدِكَ، ابْنُ أَمَتِـكَ، نَاصِيَتِي بِيَدِكَ، مَاضٍ فِيَّ حُكْمُكَ، عَدْلٌ فِيَّ قَضَاؤُكَ، أَسْأَلُكَ بِكُلِّ اسْمٍ هُوَ لَكَ، سَمَّيْتَ بِهِ نَفْسَكَ، أَوْ أَنْزَلْتَهُ فِي كِتَابِكَ، أَوْ عَلَّمْتَهُ أَحَداً مِنْ خَلْقِـكَ، أَوِ اسْتَأْثَرْتَ بِهِ فِي عِلْمِ الغَيْبِ عِنْـدَكَ، أَنْ تَجْعَلَ القُرْآنَ رَبِيعَ قَلْبِي، وَنُورَ صَدْرِي، وجَلَاءَ حُزْنِي وذَهَابَ هَمِّي O Allah, I am Your slave and the son of Your male slave and the son of your female slave. My forehead is in Your Hand (i.e. You have control over me). Your Judgment upon me is assured and Your Decree concerning me is just. I ask You by every Name that You have named Yourself with, revealed in Your Book, taught any one of Your creation or kept unto Yourself in the knowledge of the unseen that is with You, to make the Qur'an the spring of my heart, and the light of my chest, the banisher of my sadness and the reliever of my distress."

Been having bad breath for 11 years (which tormented and made my life a bloody nightmare) and now EXTREME hair loss with many food intolerances too (eating same food) and other symptoms. My fam is planning marriage TOO when I am this sick! I guess that will not happen anyways cuz I won't be alive lol. I told Allah if I have to go through this any longer then I'll do that and u cannot put me into hell cuz I've been telling u in Tahajjud. I have tried everything under the sun. I actually don't know what the heck is wrong with me. 😢 I've been crying endlessly since last month and my head hurts and I cannot help myself anymore cuz ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I cannot pretend I don't have this problem when everything seems to be overwhelming impossible for me to continue living. I wouldn't wish this to anyone, Ya Allah pls don't test anyone to this extreme. I cannot imagine what else Allah is going to test me with it's already too much, Ya RAHEEM, please have mercy on me.

Do as much you can. And I bear witness you, Allah azzawajal loves that action that moments while your are in the state of suffering and indeed he Allah azzawajal hears you and accepts you as his favorites, (except those who (Al-Mushrikeen) associate someone with Allah swt.) The reason I’m mentioning this here because I’ve been though with it and am blessed. Please brothers and sisters. Remember my Father in your duaas who returned to Allah azzawajal last week Sep/8/2021 انا لله وانا اليه راجعون Peace and blessings 🤲🏻 Love you for the sake of Allah swt ❤️

And the Word was made flesh (John 1:1, John 1:14) Jesus Christ is God. Faith in His atoning blood alone for the forgiveness of sins is the only way to Heaven. Trust the Lord Jesus Christ as your Saviour today. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God - Romans 3:23 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. - Romans 5:8-9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9

You are pure. Verily I am amongst the oppressors.” [Al-‘Anbya’ 87] Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him) said about the Invocation of Yunus “None who is experiencing difficulty employs it except that Allah would relieve him of his difficulty.” [At-Tirmidhi] Nooh (A.S) asked for the forgiveness of Allaah The Almighty, repenting by saying: Rabbi Inneee A-o’od’u Bika An As-alaka Maa Laysa Lee Bihee I’lm Wa Illaa Taghfirlee Wa Tarh’amneee Akum Minal Khaasireen [11:47] “My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking that of which I have no knowledge.

2779	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	Religions not only evolve over time but also develop “fairy tales” explaining how they don’t.
2780	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	Has the Ben Affleck on Bill Maher commentary being referenced been pulled? I can't seem to find it and don't have the proper context for some of what he's talking about.
2781	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	"How about this: 1) Humans are different 2) Humans change over time 3) Humans are really interesting and multi-faceted, and they engage with their surroundings as such In theory, ""Religious Literacy"" seems like a good idea, but are the ""three key assumptions"" actually more helpful or accurate than my three? Think how much more helpful my #1 is (Humans are different) than ""Religions are internally diverse"". True it may seem more common sense and less profound, but just how ""internally diverse"" can religions be? The answer is ""atomistically diverse"": as diverse as every individual in a population. If that's the case, wouldn't it be better to just say it that way? Again, how is ""Religions evolve and change over time"" (#2) a better alternative to ""humans and therefore human cultures change over time""? And yet, humans are still human. Why emphasize the change rather than the continuity? The third point is perhaps (in my view) the most problematic. If a person self-identifies as being ""not religious"", how are they materially different from ""religious"" humans? Don't they have influences that shape them in every sphere too? Don't their ""non-religious"" ideas inform their voting, purchases, etc.? Are they religious despite their protestation to the contrary? It's much healthier to set aside ""religion"" as a distinction and instead talk about humans and their worldviews...which are as varied as the panoply of humanity. In the long run, doesn't it make more sense for one person to receive another as an individual as a unique ""instance"" of humanity, listen to what they think and believe, and respond accordingly? Isn't it a better (and easier) rule of thumb to take each person as they come and ask them for clarification, not assuming anything about them which they haven't disclosed?"

Among the sons of men some souls are suffering through ignorance, let us hasten to teach them; others are like children needing care and education until they are grown, and some are sick—to these we must carry Divine healing."" --Abdu'l Baha"

There are always going to be differences between how two people relate to their own religious beliefs and/or practices. Obviously there will be similarities and such that can be grouped together in certain contexts but its just not possible to assume what any person believes based on the name of their religion."

All religions are interesting to me and worth studying or at least knowing about

The existence of outliers doesn't negate the uniformity of a group. Every generalization about a group should be taken with a grain of salt, but that isn't to say that there isn't reliable truth in the likelihood of behavior in line with these generalizations. As long as we recognize that ""Christians vote Republican"" is a generalization, and as such we should not expect that behavior of every single member, the statement still conveys useful information in what behavior to generally expect from that group."

2799	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	point 1 is a huge argument against religion, if everyone has their own god, why have an organized religion? I am not sure a christian who does not believe in god is a christian? Why be christian if you believe otherwise? This is religion being slippery and trying to appeal to more by saying, yes you can be christian but believe whatever you want. Furthermore this is way too obvious. Every person who reads a work of fiction gets different things from that fiction. The problem is when they start believing what that fiction is fact
2800	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	Some religions are worse then others🖖
2801	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	A lot of good points here and I think that the purpose to push the diversity argument is to fight against the simplistic and popular generalizations about religions. It is important to stress the differences between religions and within religions and at the same time, to note that there are differences which are important (very significant or essential generally because of their social consequences) and others which are not. For instance, there is violence in the Bible and the Qur'an but it is not the same violence! One is much more problematic than the other!
2802	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	1. this is a very important thing people forget. This is why the 'no true scotsman fallacy' always applies in religion. I always get tired of the radial left saying 'ISIS are not true muslims' with ISIS calling moderate west-loving muslims 'not true muslims'. NO! Any person who calls Allah the one god and Muhammed his prophet is a muslim, no matter who they love, who they don't, where they're from, and to whom they're afiliated. 2. I'm personally an atheist with a fascination for the flow of history (not specific events, but how everything slowly morphed to be) and it boggles my mind that even many Christians don't realise how much has changed even within Catholicism. They think that Lutherism is still the same as in the 1600th century and the list goes on. Why then, oh dear christian, are you wearing mixed cloth? You only need to read a few paragraphs of the new testament to realise how much has changed. This is why I hate it when religious people cling to the book. Don't do that, appeal instead to what the religion currently is. Another point with this is once again Islam. The early caliphates were relative paradise to the current middle east and especially ISIS, which are by far and a way the most regressive Islamists have been since the beginning. During the days of conquest they would keep believes in other abrahamic religions alive, granted they pay a tax. They (usually) couldn't get high positions, but they were accounted for. This was far more lenient than Christianty was back then. Look how the tides have changed. 3. This is why I love going to countries with a non-abrahamic majority. It feels like I'm really away from what I know with all these new places to explore. Despite being an atheist, I know how deeply rooted christianity is in my culture, and I don't mind it. I think religion has beautiful things to it, that's why I'm subscribed to your channel, and you can appreciate it even more going to places that don't have the same influences that you take for granted.
2803	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	Thanks for the Video! Love your very objective way of viewing things, exactly what i wanted to know.
2804	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	I'll add a few I'm stealing from _Religion Explained_ by Pascal Boyer that you might want to think about: *It's not all about god(s).* In many religions the focus is on ancestors, witches, good and evil spirits, but the gods or a god plays a very minor role.The gods, for a lot of people who believe in the supernatural, just made the world and went away. *Salvation is not always a central preoccupation.* In many parts of the world, religion does not really promise that the ‘soul’ will be saved or liberated and in fact does not have much to say about its destiny. Dead people become ghosts or ancestors but this is general and does not involve a special moral judgement. *You can have religion without having ‘a’ religion.* Many people, throughout history and today, live in a world where their religious activity is the only one that is conceivable. In other words, while Tom Smith from Tacoma, Washington might be aware that he's a Methodist and doesn't believe in many of the doctrines that Catholics (or Jews and Muslims) believe in, many people are not aware of other forms of worship so they don't classify themselves as being adherents to a religion. Their way is the only way, as far as they know. *You can have religion without ‘faith’.* Faith is key to many religions we are familiar with in the West — what you believe is central to Islam and Christianity — but there are plenty of belief systems that are not like this at all. Many people in the world would say that witches and ghosts are just part of the world around them like trees and animals—though they are far more difficult to understand and control—so it does not require a particular commitment or faith to notice their existence and act accordingly.
2805	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	It's not a person's choice whether or not they believe in a god. You can't choose what you believe.
2806	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	1. Cars are very diverse, but when you get under the tires, your fate is the same. 2. Christianity and Islam are still in favour of slavery. It's just that many people, who call themselves Christians or Muslims, do not agree with this part of the religion anymore. 3. That's finally a good point. Many people overlook that religions come with a load of believes about the world, which influence every aspect of our lives.
2807	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2GxRSW8DAE	"What's even the point of having collective terms for religious groups if we take these assumptions as true then? Obviously some degree of this acknowledgement of differences across time and space and between people, but if, let's say, ""Muslim"" is to be assumed to mean different things in Qatar and Indonesia and different things in 1979 and 2009 and different things between practitioner A and practitioner b, then what is the function of the word ""Muslim"" anymore? If the group means different things to different members of a given group it kinda feels like there ceases to be a group."

2810	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Just imagine that you are a God and you created ants and this ants are humans after u created them u put them in a garden that has anything they ever wanted you are just and totally fair that you gave them a chance to redeem themselves selves worthy before you because u created them in your own image and the devil is out to argue that u were not fair to him when he sinned so God told man and woman not to eat of the fruit of good and evil the fruit that kills man but man did not hear and he ate it now the punishment is that he and his generations will begin to die so... It's definitely man's fault that death happens but the same man still criticizes God for their own sin and punishment till this day. God through his grace and kindness brought his son Jesus christ to die for our sins and proof to us that a man can live a righteous life through his grace and the death of his only begotten son Jesus christ which has paid for all our sins what did man do? Men still refused to believe they killed those who believed and even saw him saw his grace and miracles in their lives. What's the conclusion? The conclusion is the fact that men love evil and sin they would rather takeaway anything that does not suite their narrative just to fulfill their earthly pleasures and sin man love sin than God, so bad things will always happen to man because Satan is the head of sin for he was the first to sin. The heart of a man is desperately wicked who can know it? Just take a minute to think about how many laws man and governments have to put in place to stop man's wickedness but still man is still committing crimes. The Bible says love your neighbor as your self man hates it Men Love your wife as christ has loved the church man hates it Wives respect your husbands women hates it Stop homosexuality I know why I created you with different sexes man hates it The more man hates God the more bad things will happen to man because he has given a room to Satan who loves bad things God takes your child to heaven you ask him why did he take him from you are u better than the God that created you? A man is just like an ant with little toys trying to be a human in the presence of god For instance I don't believe there is a stone why should I see stones around? Why would I believe there is a stone when clearly there is no stones? Lol. Have you ever seen an animal complain about God? and religion? No because it does not matter to them. We believe because we've seen his works, felt his presence seen his miracles dreamt about him, seen visions about him seen the unimaginable things he has created for instance you yourself your cells your DNA you said it's all chance if it's so man would have done it lol. People see Satan and end up creating a religion to serve him because he does supernatural deceitful things hence so many religions but the truth still stands firm the truth of Jesus christ. But when it's time to die or when man is sick when man is weak man 80-90% turns back to God and its always Jesus that heals them no matter which religion you are you have watched a video where Jesus healed the or heard of it why not just try out this Jesus today? How could everything be a lie? Why go to a weak church that suits your narrative?. Try out a powerful church of God and see the difference God bless you. 🙏
2811	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"If early Christians had been sincere in following Jesus's teachings, then surely the Gospel of Thomas would have been the first to be included in the canon. But the teachings of Jesus were overrruled and effectively neutralised by the teachings of St Paul, a man who never met Jesus and (if you read his famous epistles carefully) never actually quotes any of Jesus's sayings. In fact, he seems to have been totally unaware of them. Yet it was his bizarre theology that triumphed in the end and had more influence upon the development of ""Christianity"" than Christ's own teachings. I would suggest removing all of Paul's teachings and including the Gospel of Thomas in its place. Even then you would have only teachings aimed at a 1st century Jewish audience. As for understanding Jesus's teachings quoted in Thomas, anyone familiar with the multidimensional teaching stories of the Sufis and other esoteric orders would have no problem in seeing what they indicate."
2812	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why would anyone take the attitudes and opinions of church authorities seriously, in regard to original gospel texts. Those authorities are only concerned with serving the very narrow self interests of their religious organizations, by partnering with the powerful political leadership, at any given time in history.
2813	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The question, as put, is staggeringly simple to answer: like other texts, both influential and obscure, this text was not .. used widely or customarily received in the Catholic Liturgy. And that's it, no other reason; case closed. Now why 'Thomas' (as it currently exists) does not seem to have been used (frequently or at all) in the liturgies of the great centres of Church authority - and thus it is not reflected in the authors or writings of catholic orthodoxy, e.g. in its list of texts received as 'all scripture' - well, that is more complex; the briefest answer is that it was not well known, traditionally, as suitable for the divine service (being too 'late' in final composition, or not sufficiently trusted as a teaching tool). Text Criticism (supposed date, origin, witness, authority), Historical Criticism (finding a supposed 'real' author of the text/s or of the person being dealt with in various texts), et al, like all Higher Criticism forms, rest largely on subjective taste (the putative quality of a witness not the number of actual witnesses, the perceived hardness or brevity or complexity or primitiveness of the terms used, the available external evidence of other 'unrelated' or 'early' mentions, etc), which can be useful, of course, if taken as a matter for scrutiny, not of authority, of speculation, not evidence. Chiefly it is a jolly scholarly game of playing at Ockham's Razor, often misused or abused, having only one clear purpose in mind .. to get the results published (or better still disputed, requiring yet more academic discussion and publications). And that, even after all these centuries of critical form theories, remains the paradox of 'modern' Biblical Study programmes .. for they treat the reception, acceptance and handing-on of Sacred Tradition as if it were a puzzling word code, an undeciphered ancient text, or something dug up from an archaeologist's pit; it isn't, btw, it is 'life' as humans have tended to live it (never so neat as 'critics' would like to present it - or rearrange it). ;o)
2814	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"I am trying to understand Thomas. Wasn't he held in an Indian dungeon/prison? Also, Wasn't he the one who wrote the poem ""The Voyage of the Soul/Hymn of the Pearl"" whilst he was languishing in the prison? The other poem I am intrigued about is ""The Thunder, Perfect Mind"""
2815	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It is doubtful that Thomas wrote this Gospel and there is doubt about the doubtfullness of Thomas’ doubt. I doubt this is true, but yet here it is, no doubt.
2816	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"You have to remember thatvthe Roman Catholic church had the final say which books were to be included in the Bible. Maybe Thomas didn't fit their narrative or ideas as to which is ""better"" for the people."
2817	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I will, of course, have to disagree with your which came first. The Gospel of Thomas is the Q Source as it does not have narratives - it reflects the aural form of the gospels in those times. Its esoteric sayings is why it was not ‘popular’ - it was difficult to understand & certainly its claims that God is within all people would not be attractive to the fledgling Christian Churches. I have completed a comprehensive exploration of Thomas - the book is free from my website, linked at the bottom of the videos on my channel. I bow to the divine in you 🙏🏼
2818	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	First and foremost .... if its greek its A. not the original and B. most CERTAINLY mistranslated/ edited to fit greek narrative. Any Aramaic texts are going to be more reliable as that would be the more dominant language at the time in those areas. IT IS TIME WE STOP USING GREEK AND ROMAN TRANSLATIONS THEY WERE BOTH SELF SERVING AUTHORS.
2819	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	If you are a woman, you can't get into heaven according to the Gospel of Thomas. That's not the only heretical statement. The Church left it out for good reason!
2820	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	How many gospel in Christian ???
2821	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Because he probably actually wrote it. And the others are all based or originated from one gospel.
2822	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I love your explanations. They’re very straightforward. I find it interesting that the reasons for Thomas not being included as a canonical gospel that you cite have nothing to do with the veracity (or potential veracity) of the text itself. The fact that it doesn’t provide historical context, wasn’t circulated with other Gospels, was not liked by the higher ups, and wasn’t popular, does not mean it wasn’t true or isn’t accurate. (I fully acknowledge that it is hard to identify whether or not the text was accurate, but I see the overlap with other gospel texts as more than interesting ) I guess for me, it’s an insufficient reason for the church to not have accepted it. It brings a question for me, though. What was the criteria for any given book being accepted as canonical?
2823	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Have you watched Elaine Page’s video about thomas
2824	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	One of the most interesting sayings of Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas that I found that help me in End Time understanding was when they asked Jesus about the End. He tells them that by going to the Beginning would reveal the End (Note: Not quoted). This; through the years in my studies, and experiences in my life, with the enlightenment of why we must take up our Cross; showed a deeper spiritual concept I had not realized before.
2825	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Fan fiction isn't acceptable for the Bible. Like that gospel of Judas
2826	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"In the Gospel of Thomas there is a passage in which Jesus is asked, ""Master, when will the Kingdom of God come""? Jesus replies, ""The Kingdom of God is spread before the surface of the world and men do not see it"". When you have a statement that flies directly in the face of the power structure and the authority of the Church and you are a recipient of those benefits; you would be a fool to include those scriptures. Thus as the Kingdom of God is already here, what need is there for the Church? So the priests excluded it. Even then it was all about the Benjamins."
2827	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	There’s very definite evidence that the four accepted gospels were written within 40 years of Yeshua’s crucifixion… not so with this writing, allegedly from Thomas…
2828	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"A good summary, thanks. gThomas could just as well be a 1st century gospel, and might predate the synoptics. It does seem to be independent of the other gospels. Oh, and now I know how to correctly pronounce ""Origen""!"
2829	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"I love how historians spend their whole lives looking for the truth of the past in ""hear say"" and expect to unravel the mystery f life, as they miss it in plain sight."
2830	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"One very interesting take on the origin of The Gospel of Thomas is that by Nicholas Perrin in ""Thomas and Tatian: The relationship between the 'Gospel of Thomas' and the 'Diatessaron'"". Perrin makes a convincing case that Thomas was originally written in Syriac, not Greek, because of the unusually high number of words or figures of speech (502, specifically) that are distinctively Syriac in nature. Some of these distinctive words and phrases even appear in other Syriac works, such as the ""Odes of Solomon."" He also shows rather convincingly that the puzzling order of sayings in Thomas can be explained by noting that at multiple points, the sayings collections follow the order of Tatian's ""Diatessaron."" The Diatessaron was a gospel harmony written by Tatian, which drew its material from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John...all four canonical gospels. Therefore this would explain Thomas' dependence on the canonical gospels, which many others have noted. If this theory is correct, then dating Thomas becomes easier, because the Diatessaron was written between 170 and 175 CE. And if that's the case, then Thomas must have been created some time after that period---long after its supposed author was dead."
2831	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The reason there's only 1 copy of Thomas that survived is that what were considered heretical texts were eventually ordered to be burned. We don't know how popular it may have actually been.
2832	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	When Jesus spoke to his apostilles every story repeated by them would be different but similar. Example. Tell a story to a group of people. In fifteen minutes ask them to repeat the story told to them. Each will tell you a story. Each wants his story to be heard . Maybe better than the others. The apostilles were men. Each I'm sure told the Lord's story as they understand it. But similarly not the same. Thomas told the words he heard from Jesus as he heard them. They were bland to those who read it. Even as the words of Jesus they were not as lustrous as others. He simply got set aside.
2833	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	So how come you don’t mention the Council of Nicea ? You ask why it’s not included and don’t mention the the guys who decided what was included ? ( other than a quick shout out to a few aresholes , I mean St Jerome ? Very influential in the early church granted but to say his logic is flawed is being very polite)
2834	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The parable of the jar is the crown jewel of the gospel of Thomas. Enigmatic and impactful, with an intuitive message that defies direct explaination.
2835	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	If it’s not in the Bible it’s not inspired by God. Man can not prevent anything that God wants
2836	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	They removed it to control people by hiding spiritual knowledge. They molded religion into their control tool
2837	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Who cares? Jesus is already known. Shut up people!
2838	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I like how it doesn't say Jesus was divine, but it doesn't say he wasn't. When Thomas asks Jesus his identity, Jesus deflects and tells them to see what's in front of them. If Jesus was actually a human aspect of God, he definitely would have spoken in riddles the way he did in this gospel.
2839	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	What historic Jesus?
2840	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Because white people don't want people to no the real truth ......like always ...
2841	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The Bible to read love and understand, is hard enough as so, so many parts of the old testament dovetailing, how people lived, the kings of the times. If all the Books that are kept out of the Bible were added, how could you cope how could the common man/woman follow it, how would you teach it ? I am not saying that the book of Thomas is wrong or right, at some time a meeting of educated people was held who after much prayer and debate hammered out what should be in the Bible, this was not done lightly. As for my self they did a good job wining millions of souls for Christ.
2842	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	He talks about religion with fiction image in the background. Yea I get it.
2843	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"Gospel of Thomas isn't canonical because the clergy never want it to be. Maybe because in there Jesus says ""I don't need churches or priests to worship me"". Simple, huh?"
2844	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Let me abbreviate: the GoT says that James was the head of the church, not Peter. So...they'd already made sort of a big deal with the Pope and all that.
2845	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"If you drink a shot every time he says ""Gospel of Thomas"" in this video, you will be dead by the end of video"
2846	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I'm reading it, it has gross errors. It grossly resembles the other gospels but you'd have to be really shallow in theology to accept it.
2847	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	ALL the Gospels were written AFTER the alleged time of Jesus: we know this because they reference the destruction of the Temple in 70CE.
2848	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"I have always wondered - how did the heretical movements in the early Church recruit? Did they mostly recruit existing Christians, or did they do their own evangelising? Were they groups of Christians who whispered additional teachings to one another in secret but worshipped alongside the orthodox Church, or did they have their own separate gatherings? Or were they just 'the Church' but in an isolated area, where they came to their own different conclusions about key doctrines, only being seen as heretics later? We tend to think of these groups as if they were separate, but they clearly didn't have a building that said ""1st Marcionite Church"" on the sign, like Christian denominations today. Is this something we have any evidence about? Would you be interested in making a video on it?"
2849	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Thomas correctly states that the lineage goes through James, giving lie to the Church of Rome/Peter. No wonder it did not make the cannon.

2851	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It is interesting that in the following verse, Paul quotes from a scripture that has preceded him: *However, as it is written: “What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived — the things God has prepared for those who love him— [1 Corinthians 2:9]* Nowhere can we find such a statement in the Bible, however something very similar is found in the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas: *“Jesus said: ‘I will give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no hand has touched and what has not entered into the heart of man’” [Gospel of Thomas, saying 17]*
2852	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Hereza hint... Matthew Mark Luke and John... 2000 years ago... in Israel... Are Peter Paul and Mary common names for Hebrews? No, that means the names in the Bible are allegory, as are the places.
2853	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why is the revelations IN the bible? It's obviously Arab. Jesus even says by your works you ARE judged. Revelations is Islam.
2854	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It’s because the Gospel of Thomas says to look within to find God not inside 4 walls paying 10%
2855	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	There was no *historical Jesus*. There were multiple people who on and off used that name and were eventually combined into one person. Many of his myths have their roots in older religions from other cultures
2856	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, now Thomas. Never any Jose, Miguel, Abdullah, Amir, or Dion. I guess these names don't sound white enough.
2857	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why is it that mostly on Christian channels people exchange the most awful comments? It makes me wonder how on earth they're even here, calling themselves Christians? But then I think about the crusades and I know the answer. All in the name of God, really?
2858	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I'm an agnostic/ atheist. Doubting Thomas was the only one who made sense growing up in a religion. Thou he was mocked for not being an idiot and wanting proof.
2859	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	My understanding is that at Nicaea the bishops chose the 4 earliest gospels that were in the best agreement.
2860	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	In The Book of Mary (yet another apocryphal text) it's clear that Thomas and Paul were not particularly good friends. As it was Paul who originally founded the Catholic church in Rome, it's not surprising that The Gospel of Tomas was excluded from the official cannon.
2861	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	So much talk for so little substance! Who cares about these obscure texts written by obscure authors about a fictitious individual whom not one of them even claims to have known in person?
2862	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"""historical Jesus"" Like he actually existed."
2863	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	During and before the Council of Nicea in 325, the Church had eliminated some fifty books from the Bible, because they didn't want challenges to their political operation. Thomas was a doubter, and Lord knows we don't need that !
2864	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I think the 'secret sayings' may very well reflect the time jesus was purported to have spent travelling around with his uncle - where he almost certainly would have travelled through india
2865	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Jesus couldn't save himself then how he can save others?.

2867	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why CE? When you could have said AD? PC gone crazy.
2868	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Just a quick note to say Thanks for all you do. As a Muslim I have huge respect for Jesus as a Prophet but have had the hardest time understanding how this particular prophet evolved, then Morphed, into an organized religion of its own.
2869	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why do you have to speak so fast ? Why do you swallow your words ? Why do you run one sentence into the next sentence ?

2871	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	There was pushback because thomas SAW the wounds in a Risen jesus, a definite witness, of course they don't want us reading a first hand account like that..Thomas was a first hand witness, and just like the books of the NT he would have heard at least some of the same stuff
2872	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I should think any words even possible to have been spoken by Christ should be central to biblical text. Leave Jesus' words out of the book full of other people's words about Him. No reason to leave ANYTHING out today. Every religious text could be placed on ONE thumb drive.
2873	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	First of all there wasn’t any Jesus Christ all the books in the Bible is not historical the names is not names of real people the places and things no such place
2874	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Great video. Everyone who is watching , be blessed. 🙂🙂🙂
2875	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	What if Thomas is correct and the 4 common gospels are false?
2876	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It's more of a collection of quotes, very different from a gospel. If there is something redeeming I can point out about the Gospel of Thomas, I would say the intention to collect the words of Jesus seems important. There is only 114 collected quotes, so I would say that is kind of significant? Some of them do match the 4 gospels, maybe it's a mistake to dismiss the text? Do we not want to know every spoken word Jesus said?? I do! Thomas felt it was important to collect every word, it's definitely noteworthy.
2877	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I think editors have edited Thomas's Gospel from early on for their purposes that what we have today does not seems true to me

2879	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	What you're not taking into account is the original four gospels were eyewitness accounts.
2880	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"It sounds to me like this is the ""Sayings Gospel"" referred to by Papias, as recounted by Irenaeus and Eusebius."
2881	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"the gospel of Thomas as I understand it was not included because Thomas was a sceptic and required proof (Thomas was the one who asked to feel the wounds on Jesus's hands after Jesus was brought back from the dead hence the term doubting Thomas) Christianity relies on faith so Thomas, well he doesn't fit in. However, I believe that Jesus regarded Thomas as the control and relied on him for his accuracy in relaying the true words of Jesus without embellishment. The Gospel of Thomas is simply ""Jesus said..."" So Thomas is worth a read, its hard going and needs discussion one page at a time but I believe that it may actually be closer to the actual words of Jesus than the other Gospels."
2882	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	What about theGospel of Mary Magdalene...why was it not included....
2883	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	“It’s the word of god” “This is the original text” “This is also apparently original even though it contradicts the other one being original” “They’re both original”.
2884	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Maybe Thomas was just writing the most important things he heard from Jesus. Just like me writing notes from my class
2885	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	How did Jewish men of the first century have English sounding names, Mathew, Mark, John, James etc?
2886	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It’s not in the bible bc it doesn’t fit the desired narrative. It’s all hokum. Shakespeare’s Macbeth said it.... “It is a tale told by an idiot, Full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.”
2887	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
2888	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"""Ask a small child what life is and he will tell you what a kingdom is."" Young children dont know any selfishness, any greed, and no sexuality. And just like that should be someone who reaches the kingdom. So getting there is an extremely small chance. Notice that quote where Jesus mentions John the Righteous. Everything changes there. Whoever is smart will understand what Jesus wanted to say about this person. And by the way, I have solved the riddle of the kingdom of God, but I also know the rule of how to get there."
2889	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It seems that there are some teachings of Jesus which Thomas was aware of and which he had written in his ' Gospel ' These teachings were not included in the Christian Bible for unknown reasons...just like the 'Gospel of Mary' and 'Gospel of Judas'... these secret teachings probably deal with reincarnation, eternal uncreated soul, how the individual soul is of the same substance as God...karma and final liberation of the soul whereby it merges with the universal soul or God after achieving enlightenment through meditation techniques which lead to Samadhi or superconscious state.. No wonder the pope and Bible authors didnt like such stuff...
2890	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	If you bother to research the making of the bible and all things at that time influence you will see the one who declared what went in and what did not

2896	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The 4 gospels are perfection. Acts is good but Paul seems conflicted at times? Acts and beyond are more difficult, to me but the 4 gospels are perfection. Gnosticism is dark AF. seriously I have gnostic BS and a lifetime of science; in my silly head when I know the only truth is Scripture. and God
2897	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	There are actually many Greek fragments of Thomas and put together we have most of the text. The Coptic just filled in many gaps.
2898	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	“Why isn’t it in the Bible?” In my opinion Roman Emperor Constantine ( a reincarnation of Apollo) one learned in great knowledge in the schools of Mercury...using his superior wisdom shaped Christianity for the centuries to come and was the first Roman Christian Emperor.
2899	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The Gospel of Thomas was taken out because it tells a different take of Jesus. Different then what the one the Church has painted of him. Because when they took it out, they also edited the Bible, edited it just enough to make us believe it is something different and Jesus was something else.
2900	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	well, gospel of thomas now is widely available in the internet. go download and read it. so what enlightenment did u get from it?

2906	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Believing having book of Thomas were it came from? This information knowing nothing !

2909	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Just a thought...maybe the Gospel of Thomas...was just Thomas's journal..just Thomas writings to himself..for him to understand it's by faith. I'm not saying I'm right...just thinking.

2915	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	There’s also no tradition that suggests that it was actually written by Thomas. As opposed to the other four and their traditional authors.

2918	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"I can understand why the Gospel of Thomas (well, at least of my understanding) was not added to the conical new testament. Paul was a very influential saint for the west, with his writings and preaching and the gentiles he went, too.. The Apostle Thomas went east; into the India area Thomas focused more on the teachings and the model Jesus set - Thomas understood the Resurrection and Jesus' miracles as important, but it is beyond human understanding. There is no narrative, in my opinion, within the Gospel of Thomas, because Thomas did not focus on a narrative - which would have to include his miracles and his Resurrection, but humans can't understand the complexities of Jesus' miracles and Resurrection, but they are very important. Again the focus was in the teachings and model Jesus left. This is my opinion and has become my understanding. I guess you can say :I'm ""Team Thomas!"""
2919	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Ok so Thomas who actually walked with Jesus in flesh and witnessed everything, experienced his presence and was touched by him wrote a book and it was left out from the Bible, yet Paul, some Roman randy who claims he saw visions after torturing people like Thomas, was added?!!
2920	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"I love the Gospel of Thomas. It's more gnostic than the synoptic gospels, but not as gnostic as the Gospel of Judas or something like that. It has so many wonderful bits of sacred knowledge to learn from and that everyone can interpret differently. I love it when Jesus says that he is everything and that you will find him everywhere. He also says three secret words to Thomas, which I like to think were ""ehyeh asher ehyeh,"" I am who I am, because he's opening Thomas' eyes from his former ignorance and making him realize that there is more than one who ""is."" I personally think that everyone's god exists in some way, and that everyone's truth is just different because we all believe differently and see things through a different lens. That's why I appreciate the gnostic Christ so much. He came to help us see that there are many ways and that they all lead to ""the All."""
2921	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Doesnt the Book Of Revelation say that anyone who take away a word or add a word to the Bible is condemned by God? So what do God say about the guy who erased this whole book from the Bible?
2922	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	If it was me I would include the gospel of Thomas and remove at least one of the four gospels. Why? Because the four gospels Mathew, Mark, Luke and John tells the same stories with little similarities. It makes the story of Jesus redundant which makes no sense. So I vote the the gospel of Thomas be included in the Bible.
2923	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Who we think of as Jesus is actually Thomas! Jesus is the Twin, Daemon-Higher Self-Soul of the Multiverse= God/ess!

2930	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Simple why is anything not in the Bible because the head of the religion at that time didn't agree with it.

The names aren’t even theirs. If you believe in the Gospels as truth then you have to belive the many passages were Jesus clearly says he didn’t come to change the Law, period that’s it, end of story. That’s why James the BROTHER of Jesus had terrible arguements with Paul, a complete STRANGER whom never met Jesus wanting to change everything and abrogate Judaism
2940	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	If u read the gospel of Thomas Some of the sayings sounds weird n theologically incorrect. Not hard to know why it is not included

2942	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The reason the Gospel of Thomas was left out is because it advocated spiritual knowledge as they key to salvation rather than faith.

2945	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	That's the main problem of Christianity,,, out of thousand or hundreds of gospels,, man decides which would be GOD'S WORDS,, and connonise it😎😎😎
2946	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The Gospel of Thomas is not 114 sayings. It is a story out of order. Arranging the sayings back into the story involves the number eight and shifting. You could do it yourself. When you put it back in order it makes sense.
2947	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"I don't think we'll ever know exactly what Jesus did or did not do or what he said or did not say. Everything is based on material written down from memories of events decades after they allegedly occurred. We have the ""official"" version accepted by modern Christianity, but who's to say how accurate it really is. It ultimately comes down to a matter of pure faith. You either have it or you don't. Jesus was either who he claimed to be or he was not. He either came back from the dead or he did not. He either ascended into Heaven or he did not. Many atheists just dismiss him as a good, but deluded man who convinced himself he was the Son of God and wound up making enough trouble to get himself executed. He then was buried and then maybe someone removed his body from its borrowed tomb to hoax his resurrection for the apostles who blindly believed in his prophesied resurrection. Who can say for sure what the ultimate reality of the Jesus story is. One thing that cannot be denied is that it's been two long millennia since Jesus was executed and there's been no Second Coming and no resurrections of previous Christians who died ""in the faith"". This whole thing could just be one giant hoax that got institutionalized to become a major religion on Earth. Nothing wrong with any philosophy that tries to get humans to live together in peace instead of killing each other off. But religious differences have been said to be the cause of most of humanities wars and still are. I think maybe in another few centuries, as science progresses, less and less attention will be paid to the world's religions by people. They will perceive them as archaic left overs from another era. People nowadays aren't turning to prayer for results in their lives. They want a button to push to make all of their problems go away and the capitalists will do everything they can to provide them with those buttons...for a price, of course. If Jesus' Second Coming had happened, as he promised it would before the last of the original twelve apostles died off and the many following him and his teaching who had died had miraculously come back to life again, things would be a lot different on planet Earth right now.

2960	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Just wondering concerning the New Testament where are the other memories and recordings of the remaining apostles after the resurrection of Jesus Christ? Matthew, Mark, Luke and John morphed into memories by later devotee's which by the time they reached the masses was not what the original apostle's taught as pure doctrine. That has obviously given freedom to interject, embellish and change the core doctrine taught by the Son of God/Man. Read the 4 Gospel's which have differences of time, touch and witnessing of the resurrection itself to see that the core doctrine's aren't in sync with each other. Christianity according to Eastern and Western Bible's within Bible's is another manifestation of tampering which has given rise to the very act of heresy from the original understanding of Jesus Christ the Son of God/Man. There is a shattered mirror of a shattered population of a once pure doctrine. Is the answer the witness from the Holy Spirit? Than which Holy Spirit will you claim witness to, the actual Holy Spirit as the Holy Spirit or God the Father as the Holy Spirit if you consider God the Father as a Holy spirit? Than why a resurrection if Christ is a perfect God that has an immortal perfect body. He's considered perfect even as His Father in Heaven is perfect. Does that mean God the Father is still a Holy Spirit because that is what devotees proclaimed or did they actually proclaim that? We know things were written later on by devotees whose original information became subject to ideologies and interpretation's suited and molded to their times translated and interpreted into Egyptian, Aramaic, Greek, Roman Latin, German etc? Many hands dabbling in the pot freely gave rise to interpretation by those who decided what would become accepted doctrine in a book that didn't even exist back than that later became Holy Bible(s) or scripture held to be the center piece of Christ, His Father and The Holy Ghost. The heart of Christianity has somehow been able to maintain degree's of cooperation about decided and divided doctrine's that relegates the knowledge of God(s) to 60/70 books total as a global religion. I find it utterly baffling that we can even imprison knowledge let alone a Godly knowledge to several scrolls or books that make up a religion. Omniscient is a space that far exceeds the knowledge of only 1 book let alone 1 planet let alone 1 galaxy let alone 1 universe. Humanity has created Christianity into a road map that is a maze instead of a straight and narrow path. Feel free to chime in!
2961	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I have come to accept the book of Thomas because it has enriched a few topics I had questions about. I've read Thomas at least 10 times and I really enjoy it. And I'm now able to explain various of those saying which at first glance appear to contradict other saying but after further studying they go hand in hand with the rest of the bible.
2962	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The gospel of st. Thomas affirms everything the Quran said about jesus hundreds of years before the Quran was even revealed. Muhammad (pbuh) couldn't have known it existed because it was lost. Coincidence? I think not!

First lie in the bible: ""In the beginning"". Second big lie: Adam was first when ""wo-man"" means -""the womb of man"". ""The kingdom of heaven is in us and all around us."" So the universe, or God, has no need for an agent since all things are One Thing! Keep things simple not like man made authorities that must create never ending complexities in order to obscure simple truths given to us from birth e.g. ""God is greater than our greatest weaknesses."""
2969	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Virgin birth...there were definitely 5G networks back then. Do you realize that gospel authors tell us about Mary's virginity and what she dreamed of and how she was impregnated by the Holy Spirit (a dove or an angel). It is obvious that he had high definition camcorders in her intimate space, microphones and an implanted microchip that spied his thinking.
2970	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	As to your question of why Thomas is not in the Cannon. That's because when you take away the provably fake narratives surrounding Jesus, an entirely different message than the one taught in churches appears. The book of Thomas is consistent with that very different message. It was therefore too dangerous to the heathenous church of which Jesus wasn't even a part and wouldn't have been.
2971	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"I find it interesting that ""Thomas"" is derived from twin, Thomas is called ""the twin"" in the NT and the Gospel of Thomas calls him didymus Thomas - ""twin/twin"" - Greek/Aramaic - twin of who?"

Until a text from the first half of the first century that isn't an early christian source talks about such a man, there is no reason to believe he ever existed.

It blatantly says that you do not need to go to a church! It says you can find God anywhere and everywhere. The early church would have looked at this and realize if people knew this bit of information they would be out of business!

The reason the infallible canon can be known is that God revealed it through His One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. If God had not infallibly revealed the authentic canon it could never be known and there could be no Bible."
2988	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	READ The Epistle of the Apostles for an amazing read. Luke mentions that MANY wrote godples. So why are their only four? The quick rundown. 1 The Apostles did not compose a new testament 2 The apostolic fathers did not compose a New Testament 90=300 ad it helps to study church hisrtory reading orginal writings and not magazine articles or quick you tube videos. 3 In 330 AD the ROMAN Constantine converted after a vision. He legalized the church And Hired Eusebuus to write a church history for the first three centuries which is the only book all scholars must refer to. And Constantine also commisioned Eusebius to put to gether the New Testament WITHOUT CONSTANTINE regardless of all the wise men today writings all kinds of crap about him. WE WOULD HAVE NO BIBLE today. God had to raise up a GENTILE a ROMAN who were killing christrians to do what none in the church saw fut to do for centuries. SIMILARLY God reaised up Ptolemy a greek the king of Egypt so the speak on his own hired 70 hebrew scholars to translated the Hebrew old testament into greek . This was the bible in all synagogues as the apostles went out from city to city that was used and is cited from and quoted from continaulyl Though no scolars seem to know thsi today. But this was well known during the great awakwning. They followed a rule that two or more churches had to certify the book was gottern from an apostle and then pased it on to other churches The Gospel of Thomas could not be certified being passed to two or nore churches so it was cut It is aslo a fragment what we have with no begining or end. The Epistle of the Apostls could not be verified because the church that put it out the church at Jerusalem was destroyed so there was no primary church. Also cut out where imcomplete Gospels And Gospels that has manuscript errors They pulled in of 1200 books aka scriolls many were dublicates and there were a few frauds MOST of the frauds we see today were manufactured during the middle ages by monks in monistaries

God said that whoever changed his times and laws would be of satan in Daniel 7:25. yet the catholic church openly boasts of doing BOTH, all while composing the bible on their own authority for hundreds of years. They even forbit the population from reading or owning their version of the bible, so that noone over time could prove what was originally in it. So God condemned the catholic church for changing his times and laws and openly said they are deveived liars for doing so, yet you honor THEIR OPINION of what the modern day bible is aloud to entale? So foolishish beyond comprehension. Have you even read the bible? It literally tells us to beware of anyone who abolishes Gods times and laws, yet the very people who did so now get to control biblical history and judgement that you historians eat up like school girls. Just because some book isn't found in our modern day watered down bible composed by Catholics, doesn't mean it wasn't considered scripture to the true believers inspired by Christ. Did you know that Christ quoted from 2 separate books NOT FOUND IN MODERN DAY BIBLES, yet Christ spacificly said ""THEY ARE SCRIPTURE"". Clearly, like always, Jesus and the catholic church are at odds."
3003	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It's the only gospel that you'll find in occult book stores, so you can conclude based off of that fact. Also, no Christians consider it worthy of the status deuterocanon let alone canon. It's widely considered a forgery.

Whoever composed GoT was concerned with the concerns of the later Syriac believers, which are absent prior to 150. Special pleading claims of much earlier creation, with NO evidence, is the desperate attempts by the likes of Crossan and Pagels to recast Christ as just another semi Gnostic ""wisdom teacher""."

3028	220	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The Gospel of Thomas was not included for one simple reason: it has so much false heresy I don’t even know where to begin. Start by reading Gospel of Thomas 114 - it’s not even a question as to if actual scholars think this book should be added. Gospel of Thomas 114: “Simon Peter said to them: “Let Mary go away from us, for women are not worthy of life.” Jesus said: “Look, I will draw her in so as to make her male, so that she too may become a living male spirit, similar to you.” (But I say to you): “Every woman who makes herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven.”

3030	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It's not in the Bible because it's not inspired by the Holy Spirit.
3031	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Interesting, If says JESUS that means they change it. Every person is call by the birth name. Why not Yeshua = Yahshua=Joshua
3032	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Just cause something was seemingly more popular doesn’t mean those gospels weren’t changed when rewritten and honestly gospel of Thomas is pretty early and isn’t it common knowledge Jesus most likely had been to Egypt at some point? His magic like walking on water is said to have some parallels in Egyptian practices. Just saying its worth looking into as another ancient resource..
3033	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Find ur own research: gospel of Thomas contain 2 important information regarding eesa AS (Jesus AS) which not exist on 4 Canonical gospel: 1. the living bird made from clay which Jesus AS blown a soul into it and 2. the speaking on a craddle of baby Jesus AS to israel people, now open Qur'an surah no. 3 (Ali Imron verses 46 and 49) , lot of information were hide by the christian scholar yet the truth Will prevail and the false Will perish ( open Qur'an no.5 al maidah verses 15), if u r a sincere person u Will find the truth, aameen,,,😇🤲

Like someone or a group were doing historical research, collecting the sayings of Jesus/Yeshua (insert your preferred name) and recording them in one source. It makes sense to me that it would be older then, in that case. Interesting either way.

They already nickel and dime us with the various Jesus 'The Teenage Years' side quests and alternate Revelations ending story lines.

3048	240	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Do you research sir. Luke, Mathew, Mark and John were not written by the Apostles. The names were given by the Church in the 3rd century. All the Gospels have been altered and added to. And the Gospel of John was written in the second century. It is just as bad as The Gospel of Tomas. No contemporary accounts of Jesus.
3049	241	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why do you assume that there was an historical Jesus? There are a whole lot of words attributed to Moses - the Jewish prophet to end all prophets - but there's I can't find a whole lot of consensus that there was a Moses.

3051	243	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I’m sorry to ask but are you Catholic are you Christian And I don’t know if you know that we believe Bible is inspired word of God and that, by Holy Spirit, Catholic Bishops put canon together so why waste time with yes or no when is already no and about this “Gospel”, when if God wanted, that would be in canon I don’t believe Holy Spirit made mistakes and wish we had that then to put it in Second point is I see brother you are good, genuine, intelligent man but trust me, even sound doctrine people turn to heresies and any doubts or seeds of conspiracies in your videos will make conspiracies flourish and contra effects of what you try to do here So be careful
3052	244	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	their is nothing difficult here. thomas followed jesus around and wrote down what he said, like a secretary, no embellishment, scene setting, or long winded interpretations. just the facts for those who have ears and eyes. not much political capital in that..
3053	245	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"I like it when the guy keeps saying ""the historical jesus"" as if there is such a thing."
3054	246	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Again and again I come across videos on YouTube about the gospels of mark, Matthew, Luke & John. Now we have the gospel of Thomas. There is so much emphasis placed upon the 4 gospels but haven’t we forgotten a few things here? First point I want to make is none of the gospel authors knew Jesus And there’s no evidence to suggest they did. So how can we believe them to be truthful? They all appear to have evidence based in third party accounts. Why? Christianity is based upon these 4 main gospels but has anyone asked the question where is the gospel of Jesus? Surely his gospel would be the true and Devine gospel sent to him by God? But there is no record of it? Jesus did not give any of the gospel authors the right or the authority to form the basis of the religion. So why are so many Christians following books that have little or no baring on what Jesus said in his own words? Finally, who would have known Jesus well? The disciples? Nope! Other followers at the time of Jesus? Nope? The one person who brought up Jesus, fed him, clothed him, knew his likes and dislikes, knew what he said and what he meant would have been known by none other than the mother of Jesus, Mary. There’s not even a mention in the New Testament to what Mary describes Jesus in his sayings or his behaviour. But can you show me the gospel of Mary? Nope! No one can. So why is that? Why is no one asking this question today? It’s a rhetorical question which Christians need to be asking in this day and age.
3055	247	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"lack of inclusion of ""Gospel of Thomas"" (or Gnostic writing) from the NT had nothing to do with any kind of political suppression or conspiracy. anyone who disagrees is free to show me any credentialed modern historian of the period who argues otherwise. read these texts for yourself (they are freely available) and understand that ""The Da Vinci Code"" is nonsense. the Gnostics were not some ancient hippies. they were hardcore ascetic esotericists (and anti-semitic)."
3056	248	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I’ll help answer this in utter simplicity: MOST of these sayings are just plain DUMB as a brick! Jesus was demonstrably the most ethical genius in all of history. Even all the teachings on ethics and morals in the last 2000+ years of history are mere footnotes on Jesus’s Sermon on The Mount. End of debate! Forgery.

3060	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why would the Catholic Church have included anything that diminished their Power ?. That's a clue to the Answer. LOL
3061	253	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"ah the Gospel of Thomas, a spurious, 2nd century text, forged in the name of the apostle of the same name, produced by a sect that rejected God, rejected the universe, believed Jesus was never human (never born, never died, etc), were against sexuality, and loved to misquote Paul (ironic, since they were anti-Jewish, and Paul, like Jesus, was a Jew). I am of course talking about the Gnostics, a group that was given a make over by modern non-experts like Dan Brown into some kind of hippie new age reformers, when they were nothing of the kind. Let me close with my favorite quote from the Gospel of Thomas (a book which Nigel says is ""inspired by God"" and we can know this by ""asking Jesus""): Simon Peter says to them: ""Let Mary go out from our midst, for women are not worthy of life!"" Jesus says: ""See, I will draw her so as to make her male so that she also may become a living spirit like you males. For every woman who has become male will enter the Kingdom of heaven."" (saying 114). that's right, it's not from the Bible, it's not Paul, that's his beloved Gospel of Thomas, written by Gnostic heretics after the apostles were long dead."
3062	254	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The Gospel of Thomas was written after Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, so no, it did not come before the 4 gospels of the Bible.
3063	255	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Because it is against Paul’s pagan belief and teachings. Thomas was one of the closest disciple of Christ, his Gospel should be given the utmost position. It shows Christianity is well designed by pagan King James.
3064	256	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	the reason is simple, the people who compiled the bible wanted to send certain messages and themes, if a gospel didn't fall in line they left it out. it's all about control
3065	257	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The gospel of John wasn't written until after 90AD, the church had no problem including other books that obviously were not written by someone who claimed to be a disciple but clearly were not.
3066	258	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	any gospel that didn't conform to the Church's brand of Jesus didn't make the cut
3067	259	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It’s Gnostic because it reads like a Quantum Masterpiece, in the Microcosm and macrocosm.
3068	260	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	my pastor says they kept that 📖 out for a reason for example like the Mary Magdalene gospel was not included in the text!although the Pope have the Gnostic gospel stories withdrawn they say it's not for everybody to read
3069	261	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Do you think God allowed man to determine what comprised the Word of God. Apostle Peter took steps to ensure that the Word of God would be passed on after his death. 2 Peter 1:12-15,20-21 KJVS [12] Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them , and be established in the present truth. [13] Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; [14] Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. [15] Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. [20] Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. [21] For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. 2 Peter 3:2,15-16 KJVS [2] That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: [15] And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; [16] As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. As you see Apostle Peter started the effort to ensure that the words of the Old Testament prophets, and New Testament gospels and epistles would be compiled for future generations. He also endorsed Apostle Paul’s epistles which is important because some like to claim there were two gospels. One to the circumcision and one for the Gentiles. Which is utter nonsense. http://www.justifiedfreely.com/?p=202

3071	263	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Thomas was also hanging around with Prophet Jesus. So some saying are the same. But maybe the pagen people and the the people in power do not want it just like Mary's written words.

3096	288	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	So...we’re just going to ignore the fact that one major factor that contributes to the Gospel of Thomas not being canonical is that it contains stories that flat out contradict the Gospel narrative?

I'm sure all the gospels contain some truth but the fact they have been retranslated several times and written by man which only means that there are most likely some imperfections. I have gotten closer to god now that i have learned to look within.
3099	291	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It didn't circulate because of the Catholic church
3100	292	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why does the KJV have fewer books then the CCDV? Agenda of course. The bible may have been compiled and the new testament partially written in the 4th century. There are more gospels out there that were left out then the four left in and why is mathew before mark, when mark was written earlier. Why are the four gospels contradictory? So many questions so few answers. Why don't we just reclassify the bible as pure fiction and end all debate. Before Greek mythology there was Helenism and the ancient religions of egyptian religion. Then of course there's the oldest living religion, hinduism.

3123	315	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The early church fathers kept lots of writings out of the Bible because those writings did not fit with their view of Jesus and their role as his followers. In that respect, you could say the New Testament is incomplete at best and fraudulent at worst.
3124	316	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The Gospel of Thomas didn't serve the purposes of the Catholic Church so it had to go.

3137	329	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	You're just parroting what others have already pondered and i do not believe you offer anything new nor unique. There are many who disagree with the view that you are quoting. There are many scholars that believe the Gospel of Thomas was a commonly used book for early Christians teachings. The fact that the Gospel of Thomas was considered as a possible book to put into a New Testament suggests that before there was a New Testament that many early followers deemed Thomas worthy. It all changed once a New Testament was made and voted on. Not all agreed, and I like to keep that in mind because if those who disagreed were part of the early church leadership then they were Christians whose opinions and votes mattered. Just because the vote was not in favour of Thomas being included does not mean it is not christian. Most conclude that Thomas is ungodly because it didn't get included. Yet it was a favourite of many faithful Christ followers until the early church declared anything they did not include in the New Testament to be heretical and should be destroyed. As the church then did destroy everything written not part of their new book. Hunting down any who disagreed, then torturing and murdering them. It is with great joy I read the literature found in Nag Hammadi and the Dead Sea scrolls. Because of a few believers who disobeyed the church and saved them. Sadly so many were burnt for heat by the people who found them unknowingly. They tried to create their own view of religion not allowing people to follow their own inner guidance. Reading other early Christian writings gives a different perception on being a Christian. Not so legalistic. My opinion and I reserve the right to change my views.

So the important thing to remember about the canonical Gospels and Acts is that they were all written after the first primary text of Christianity: the Pauline Epistles. The teachings of Jesus are generally presented in a way that supports the dogma of Paul. Given Paul's obvious education in Greek rhetoric, Jesus can often seem like that earlier martyr to truth, Socrates."

Those that existed BEFORE the christians of today yet so smart to call them gnostic because they think they where in error yet you believe in 4 gospel from the 300 GOSPELS where the author is annonymous ! GOOD JOB NOT ABLE TO BELIEVE THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE LIVED WITH THE PROPHET JESUS CHRIST PBUH ! What you do today is to believe in Constantin The guy that decided to chose 4 gospels ! For wich raison ? was he a deciple ? a Priest ? a Companion of Jesus christ ? no yet you believe what chose Constantin and not the Priest and the Disciples of Jesus christ ! You believe what the Pagan believed But not What the people of jesus christ believed ! BY THE WAY YOU CHRISTIANS ! HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU !? THE GNOSTIC WHERE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST PBUH YET YPU PAGANS PERSECUTED THEM BECAUSE IF WHAT THEY BELIEVED ? THEY WHERE CLOSER TO JESUS AND TO JERUSALEM THEN YOU ROMANS PAGANS ! AND THEY WHERE THE FIRST TO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST! SO WHAT IF THEY WHERE NOT IN ERROR AND YOU TODAY ARE ALL IN ERROR ? EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ?? WHY IS IT THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THE GOSPELS IF THOSE THAT WHERE NEAR AND CLOSER TO JESUS PBUH LIKE THE ARAMAIC PEOPLE AND OTHER TRIBES LIKE EGYPTIANS AND ALL OF THAT INSTEAD YOI BELIEVE IN PAUL YOU KILLED CHRISTIANS ! HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN WORK EXPLAIN ME THAT !? NEVER HEARD OF THE GOSPEL OF BARNABEAS ??!?

I think Thomas and the book of, is rather gnostic and much more awe inspiring when the hidden message is revealed to you. Add the Book of Thomas to bible or not, though it should be recommended to all of mankind to read.
3153	345	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I read parts of the Gospel of Thomas. It spoke about how a young Jesus made mud bird and brought them to life and they flew away. That is why the Gospel of Thomas is not used. 1 This little child Jesus when he was five years old was playing at the ford of a brook: and he gathered together the waters that flowed there into pools, and made them straightway clean, and commanded them by his word alone. 2 And having made soft clay, he fashioned thereof twelve sparrows. And it was the Sabbath when he did these things (or made them). And there were also many other little children playing with him.
3154	346	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It isn't in the Bible because Rome worked hard for 300 years to crush the teachings of John the Baptist and Jesus, before they finally created Christianity in 315. The actual Gospels were written so late (70-150) that they are just as suspect as the Gospel of Thomas. James, apparently carried on Jesus's teachings, but all James' followers were wiped out by Rome.

3159	351	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Since Thomas is exclusively a list of sayings, why is it called a gospel?
3160	352	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The whole question of Is Jesus the Father? Are the Father and the Son equal? What came first the Father or the Son? None of that makes any fricking sense and it's all hogwash. I think Paul/Saul made it up. If you believe in Jesus as a spiritual creature, he had to come after the Father, and was less than him. Much of the gospels were a bunch of malarkey.

3162	354	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"Thomas means ""twin"". Which means he is Jesus' twin brother. That's why he was able to write down all these sayings of Jesus. Thomas was considered by some to be the true Messiah, and not Jesus, which is why some Christians say he is the Christ and call themselves Thomas Christians. Thomas Christians were Assyrians from the Van region of Turkey who migrated to India in search of Thomas who they say travelled to India. There is a theory that the Christ entombed in Srinigar is Thomas. There is a schism in Western religion and culture between Roman Catholicism and non Roman Catholics, many of whom refer to the Pope as the anti-Christ. Behind this is the idea that Jesus was a King, which is what the New Testament actually says, ie., that he descended from the royal line. He would be a messiah if he came back to restore that royal line and get rid of the Romans. He didn't succeed and, instead, the Romans turned him into a peace preacher. The Koran says that Jesus will return on a white horse to slay the false messiah at the gates of Lydda, which is the birthplace of St. George. What appears to have happened is that the Roman Catholic church used a conflated figure of Jesus and Thomas and made them into what we know as Jesus Christ, and then they made the King, Jesus, into St. George, which is why so many Christian countries in different parts of the world have St George as their patron saint."
3163	355	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"In the conventional four Gospels it is written - those who are now First, will be Last, and those who are Last .... wil be First."" This applies to the ""newer"" Gospels of Thomas, Phillip, Marry Magdalene and Judas. GOSPEL of THOMAS - rumoured that Jesus directly addressed Thomas, and. Thomas, wrote it down directly. Thomas and Judas were well educated. The Church - whether it be the Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches as well as the Born Again U.S. movement - detest the Gospel of Thomas as they CANNOT alter the teachings. THOMAS Gospel of - It is sayings/teachings and NO MENTION of the miracles or where Jesus and the Apostles were geographically i.e. Jesus went to the lake of Tiberius. Historical Jesus - In the more ""esoteric texts and essays' Jesus advises the Apostles not to worship his literal image and personality. Jesus wanted too, and still does, focus on his teachings . . . AND . . . the Gospel of Thomas does that."
3164	356	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Who cares. Jesus never existed. It's just a fairytale adopted and modified from previous astro-theological traditions. And even if there was a historical Jesus are we to believe that there was someone following him around transcribing verbatim all he said? Highly unlikely. Religion is the worst thing that has ever happened to humanity. Just a malodorous pile of distorted and incoherent contradictions that require the suspension of reason and logic to make it credible.
3165	357	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"i''ve heard it argued that the main reason why The Gospel of Thomas was not included is because it contains no mention of The Crucifixion or blood atonement which were the principle themes that separated the Pauline churches from other forms of Christianity that were considered ""heretical""! Indeed, the book of JAMES barely made it!"
3166	358	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I think the theological differences are more important for an explanation of why it isn't in the canon. While some of it has parallels to the canonical gospels the overall understanding of Jesus and the greater theology is not in concert with what became orthodox Christianity. In some ways The Gospel of Thomas is more like the Tao Te Ching than the canonical gospels. This is not to say that I think the Tao Te Ching had any influence on it, only that the outlook is more similar.

3169	361	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Gospel of Thomas contains a range of information on Jesus which are NOT found in the 4 canonized gospels (which has Roman and Jews fingers on). The fact that there are greek text are found in Gospel of Thomas proves that it came earlier than the four canonized gospels. Gospel of Thomas are more of a journal of what Jesus has said. Why the church refused to accept Gospel of Thomas which shows no contradictions as much as what you have in the four gospels? My understanding is it is because the Gospel of Thomas stated very revealing stories of Jesus's miracles which are NOT found in the four canonized gospels. It is incriminating since these miracles of Jesus mentioned NOT found in any on Christian teaching but are stated in the Quran. The stories of Jesus PBUH stated in Gospel of Thomas are; (i) Jesus, just a few days old, with the wish of his Lord, spoken to his mother Mary PBUH to affirm her rightiousness against all the curse and mistreatment she had been suffering from her community due to her giving birth to Jesus (without getting married); (ii) Jesus blew life into clay birds, with the permission of his Lord, the clay birds become alive and flew away; (iii) Jesus, like all prophets sent by God to human being, was responsible to bring forth messages from God to correct where we had gone astray. Hence, Jesus had to face and fight the power in presence, ie. the Roman & the usury practicing Jews. And he was not lying down, giving his left cheek to the enemies of God. (It was to the Roman and the Jews interest at the time to see the Christians are tamed and mellowed down by portraying Jesus as non-belligerent) Study Gospel of Thomas and satisfy yourself. God sow in every heart of his creation with the eagerness to find Him. You search and you will find. A good human being when encounter a story like this will take an effort to study and verify. Be a good servant of His.

3171	363	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The funny thing is they were all separate books canonized by the people who created purgatory so its impossible to truly know. But I will say this the gospel of Thomas contains deep philosophical thoughts that should be explored and respected.
3172	364	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The truth is that the council of Nicea omitted the Book of Thomas because of what it said, not because of its name. One of the central themes of the gospel is that it suggests that churches, and church leaders were arbitrary and irrelevant. That worship of god wasn't necessarily handled by the church, and that every man was allowed to do it in his own way, and in his own form. (I say man because they never really included women). The idea that churches and leaders weren't important was a foreign and distasteful concept to Constantine, who wanted to cement his hold on the empire, proved to be counter to the power that being the head of a religion held for him. Seriously thought, how do you elicit control over worshipers who don't pay homage to a place, or a sycophantic hierarchy, especially since those are necessary to secure 'tributes' or alms aimed at increasing the power and wealth of the church? No, this was a power based decision, and not one arbitrarily decided on a name.

It points to God being with us all, rather than an external being ""in the sky (or the sea), this runs highly counter to christianity in it's form today. That current form, does seem more from authority than organic. It support a hierarchical view of ""heaven"", which aids people forming the view this should be how things are on earth. I think the view of divinity given by this gospel, would likely jar with the views, or desired perception of, divinity, of those in authority to compile the Bible. We can see this in the wiping out of pagan beliefs (and people) .. as pagan beliefs do not lend a society to having a belief in such a structured and focussed hierarchy, rather stressing every person can have a direct relationship with the divine, regardless of status. This view is very threatening to those who wish to keep a triangle like power structure, as seen in monarchy... and even in republics. In the later the hierarchy is less focussed than in a m monarchy, with it relying on wealth, power and position... with an illusion of openness and the rule of the people, rather than the powerful few. As above so bellow, if you see heaven ruled by heirrachy, this will impose on how you think the material world should be... as likewise, if you see all people as equal aspects of the divine, with that power within us all, people will more likely see a true republic, volunteerism or similar as how the material world should be. In my view that is."
3189	381	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	HI Hep Hopa. Thanks for the reply. I was using the concept of Dualism that I've read in several sources. The Upanisads are one source, as are numerous Buddhist scriptures. I don't fully understand it, as I haven't read it in depth, but Plato's Idealism covers the concept of dualism. Dualism is an extremely broad term, that I understand covers much more than good versus evil. Check out Plato.org. The Gospel of Thomas reads as riddles, which could be interpreted as non-dual. It can of course be interpreted in many other ways. In academic scholarship, it's a bad idea to just make stuff up. Better to use established concepts, and expand on them using referenced sources to avoid plagiarism.
3190	382	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The reason is, it placed the power in man an not Jesus. In man there is a Light. An what you bring forth will save you,an what you do not being forth will destroy you. Clearing states that you are your own savior. That why it not inbthe bible.

3194	386	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"First and foremost....The reason that the Gospel (Book) of Thomas is not in our present day Bible is very simple to understand; The Papal influence removed this book (and many others) in order to promote ""Religion."" Much like the guy narrating the video is doing, the Catholics began removing books, and concerning the Arianism (Arian Christianity), as well as the Gnostics of the time. The Book of Thomas (Gospel of) gives us not only a very good look into Jesus as a child, but also gives us many relative, and poignant warnings concerning our souls, and how megalomania (the rise of the tangible self, or ""ego,"" or ""pride"") must be kept in close observation as to keep our soul, and therefore our minds focused on our God, in the coming time(s). Religion, most notably the Catholic religion paints a false, and very veiled ideology of who Jesus is , how Jesus behaved, and what Jesus mission, and message was to the world, for all time. Jesus was a very staunch man, with a perfected mind....this would place into our purview that Jesus was not always happy, but rather very militant minded, and on a mission from Almighty God (who is not Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior), yet was present with God in the creation. Those who can read and understand Hebrew see this in the first symbol of the Hebrew bible. Jesus was and is a very common sense man, yet was/is very empathic, letting his spirit connect to the Holy Father, and therefore influence his mind, and resulted behavior. The book/Gospel of Thomas clearly shows these things, and therefore was removed in order to promote religion, and false narratives...A profound example of this is how the Catholic church promotes the ideology that Jesus Christ was/is a Jewish man....which is not factual, and told to us, by Christ himself. ""If my kingdom was of this earth, why then, would my people give me up unto persecution?"" The Jewish crucified Christ, or attempted to depending on what you read (The Book of Barnabas), and the plack placed above him on the crucifix was a mockery ""Here is Jesus Christ ......hahaha, the ""king"" the king of the Jews....hahaha."" People get to know your savior, and quit believe the ""religious."" Your relationship is to be personal, and not riddled with religious fairy tales....this means study the Bible, learn the ancient languages, and grow closer to your Almighty God, who is without equal, who has given us many examples (including his own Son), for us to learn from."
3195	387	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Thomas was deliberately dropped from the religious canon by the early church fathers. It was a gospel that revealed the teachings and sayings of Jesus. The community of believers that Thomas wrote for had no use for the passion, the crucifixion or the resurrection. They considered Jesus’ authentic message to be more important. The result of this became the formulation of a religion Jesus himself would have rejected. It wasn’t until the 5th century that the iconography of Jesus began to depict Jesus actually on a cross. The passion and resurrection stories were only part of the early faith. They were not the center.
3196	388	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"The Bible was meant to be understood by everyone, and had to be simplistic. Gnosticism is confusing, especially IF it expressing non-dualism. Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta are non-dual and existed before the time of Christ. They might have been around the Mediterranean during Christ's lifetime. Non-dual is an awkward term for oneness. There is not 2, there is only one. Mental Monism and Idealism are other terms for the same thing. Plato did write about it, and Plato is a source for Gnostic concepts. Duality is a term for how we view everything: mind versus matter, this and that, light and dark, etc. It's normal, and seems to be what we experience. For people who are unable to accept that only mind is real, and matter is an illusion, a non-dual Gnosticism would be scary and blasphemous. Non-dualists would have to keep their ideas ""secret"", to avoid being killed by orthodox Christians. You are not real and don't exist: the ""brain in the vat"" is a modern expression of this. This is as much a frightening concept now, as it would have been 1800 years ago. How do you process the idea that your mind is real, but your body is an illusion, or a dream? The ultimate logical reduction is there is only one mind, that of God. And all that is real is the singular, eternal, infinite, unchanging mind of God. There is no physical World. At best, you are an undifferentiated idea in the mind of God, and separate individual people can't exist. We'd all be exact ""twins"" of everyone else: all souls are identical. And there is only one soul. Its hard to think like this. This would clearly be crazy and unacceptable to the illiterate Christians, and clergy, of the Roman Empire, as well as of today. Thomas would have to be banned. Logion 22 in particular can read as non-dual. Logion 11 also seems to hint at a non-dual point of view. The idea that Christ was teaching some form of Buddhism or the Upanishads is heretical to modern Biblical Christians."

By that time the Gospel of Thomas had already made it to Egypt. The estimates of when the original was written range from 40-140, but the core was almost certainly around in the mid first century. I don't think it's so easy to dismiss this as a later text when the canonical gospels were clearly written by well educated Greeks well after the death of Jesus."

3204	396	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The GOSPEL of Thomas. The only true link to Yehosuah. Untarnished by the early western church. The Church of Jerusalem was destroyed. All authentic teachings perverted. The True knowledge and message comes back again.. open your eyes. Open your heart!
3205	397	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Haha ever read the gospel of Thomas? It's so bizarre. Nothing like the biblical gospels at all. It's nonsensical really.

That did not sit well with the church. God is the ALL, and I'll leave it at that."

3211	403	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	What I want to know is this: Where is the Gospel of Jesus??? God sent His Messenger, Jesus, with a Message for people but the Book of Jesus has vanished into thin air! Where is it? Who has it? We instead have been handed the Gospels of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John and for over 2000yrs have accepted blindly that this is the Message of Jesus. Jesus himself never declared himself the son of God. He claimed he was mortal and was only a Messenger sent by God. 300yrs after he passed away Constantine et al revamped the true teachings of Jesus. They hid away the Message of Jesus and gave us the Gospels instead. They introduced the idea of his divinity, his miraculous birth without a father and miracles all to influence a new religion that Jesus himself didnot bring!
3212	404	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It's in the Koran. It's oldest source is 350 ad. The Bible was put together in this time so no they didn't even concider it as gospels during niceen creed. It's blasphemy. It's obviously a source used by Mohammad and a attempt to remove Jesus Devinity. Mathew mark like abd John are all dated to 30- 100 ad with Luke's gospel only added because he wasn't Christian but was a well credible historian who had thousands of first had witness accounts as he explaied. All other three sources was first hand eye witness testimony. There is 5800 copy of these 4 gospels in greek and 2800in Latin that date to before 2nd century. This we have toady in museums you can only imagine how many cops existed during Constantinople. Nice an creed meetings. It was obvious these were the dominating sources.no questions it's the correct gospels all others are herracy. All accounts after 3rd century are a direct assault on the Christian and Jewish faith as they obviously contradict ancient text.
3213	405	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I think that the gospel is real, written by the Greek intellectual, architect Thomas, travelling through India, without Jewish influence. The gospel is therefor not gnostic.
3214	406	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The bible itself is full of contradictions and heresy concerning Jesus
3215	407	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Gospel of Thomas eventually verified the truth of the quran about two miracles of Jesus that not mentioned in old and new testament.That miracles is about baby jesus speaking in his mother cradle and the statue of bird became the real bird
3216	408	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I'd love to hear your take on the book of Enoch.
3217	409	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Probably because there was no such names as Thomas, Luke, Dan etc... In the middles east over 2,000 years ago, lol
3218	410	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	As some have wisely pointed out on the internet - if Matthew the tax collector existed he would have had access to 'paper' and ink - 2000 years ago you couldn't just go to a convenience store and buy writing materials. Tax collectors probably carried note books, thereby making it possible for them to write in shorthand while someone spoke. In other words Matthew would have written the earliest gospel because he had the physical materials necessary to take notes and put them together into a collection of teachings by Jesus.

3221	413	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why it's not in the bible today? It's not simple popularity, you wish. What kind of lie people been telling you. The real reason is, blame it on the great dictatorship Constantine who after Nicaea convention, decided to only included the only 4 gospels and purge all others from the face of the earth to avoid confusion and contradiction, little to know his version of bible is already full of contradictions.Nowadays we can find gospels emerges from dead was able hidden from Constantine purges.
3222	414	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The gospel of Thomas confirms the story of the Quran about Jesus as follows: 1- quran mentioned that Jesus would make mud clay into the shape of a bird, blow into it and it will come to life. This is only found in the Gospel of Thomas 2- Jesus speaking as an infant, again this is only found in the Gospel of Thomas. This is one of the Miracles of our prophet mohamed as he didnt say it of him self since these information were not known to any one at all and christians would lough at muslims and say, look at you book and those weird stories it says about Jesus.
3223	415	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	You’re missing a very integral and important part as to why this “gospel” is not in the Christian Gospel. The Gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. It is this proclamation that is the foundation upon which all of Christianity is formed. It is the subject of the four canonical gospels, and is explicitly mentioned in every single Epistle in the New Testament. The Gospel is contrasted with worldly wisdom by Peter and Paul. So, when a book comes along which proclaims to have “wisdom” without having any mention of the Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Christ, it does not meet the standard for canonicity.
3224	416	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Oh man! Scholarship and endless talking can really turn something simple into a nightmare of confusion. All you really need to know is that Jesus is God in the flesh - He created everything, has all power, is above all and died for our sins and rose again. He is the only way to heaven, salvation is a free gift through faith, not a works based practice. That's pretty simple. It starts and ends with Jesus.

By 410 AD, after decades of research and discernment, the canon of scripture was finally and fully assented to by The Church. The final chapter of the final book of the Bible contains a warning that’s worth consideration.
3231	423	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Why worry about these conspiracy documents when there is so much to study and learn with what we have. People are being led on rabbit trails that lead away from Christ. There could have been much more written about Jesus but there was not. Because there is enough as it sits. Love the Lord your God and love your neighbour as yourself. Upon this the law rests. We need to be found working not looking for conspiracy. People are suffering and need to learn about Christ. Most people are bible illiterate today with what we have. People do not know Christ.

3234	426	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Perhaps we should define “gospel”. Once you understand that, clearly this is a heretical book. What “good news” do you obtain from these sayings? Their is no salvation like we see in the synoptic gospels. Prove that the book of thomas brings salvation thru Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. Does it show how Jesus fulfilled prophecy? Your bias is showing because you showed nothing to illustrate the reasons why it is not accepted. Which I understand due to the time constraint. How is a “certain woman” and “yeast” a parallel? Because one mentions heaven and the other the kingdom of the father, that makes it a parallel. You ignored the context all together. The mustard seed is a better parallel. a little yeast will work throughout the dough like a small group of christians has spread christianity throughout the world. This book of irrational sayings is exactly why it is not accepted. whoever hears these words will never taste death. But in the bible it says you will experience death once and then the judgment. You must be critical of everything we read. How can we be intellectually honest with our approaches otherwise
3235	427	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The reason the Gospel of Thomas isnt in the bible is because some of the verses are complete nonsense and stupid. Of course there's a sprinkle of truth to it. Otherwise it wouldnt even be considered.

3237	429	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Having read the Gospel of Thomas, and before coming to Jesus as my Lord I was instructed in the Vadanic school of Hinduism, I can safely say that many of the quotes, specified as coming from Jesus, in the Gospel of Thomas, are indeed vadanic. I'd have to read the book again to give a specific quotation. However, since Thomas is said to have evangelized portions of India it is possible that some of his disciples blended the vadanic view into the stories and sayings of Jesus, that Thomas had told them, and compiled them into a single issue.
3238	430	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Nobody knows what Jesus did or did not say, or who he was, or even if he was. All we have are a bunch of writings from people claiming they were his words written decades or centuries after his death that all conflict with each other, and indeed to actual recorded history as to events and circumstances. It's a huge stupid mess that only the extremely credulous would spend any time investigating and come away with any faith in. If you submitted any of it in a western courtroom as evidence, it would literally all be thrown out as inadmissible hearsay. The faith tenants of Christianity, like every other religion, are simply made up. You can take what lessons you wish from it - there is certainly a lot of good wisdom in among the made up nonsense (most of it borrowed from earlier religions and philosophies) - but the actual idea of Jesus being the son of God is indeed, just nonsense.

3242	434	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It dates later than the gospel, it was not accepted by any early christians but surely known by them, and is obviously gnostic. It carries no weight when examined by biblical scholars. Nice try. Plus there are so few manuscripts to compare, whereas there are thousands of biblical manuscripts. But dont let that get in your way, just believe it because it's there.This is elementary stuff here.
3243	435	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The infancy gospel of Thomas is badass. It has toddler temper tantrum Jesus.

3245	437	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I think one of the problems the Church had with the Gospel o Thomas was the last passage describing an arguement between Jesus and Peter about Mary Magdalene.
3246	438	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"Anyone who wants to know why the Gospel of Thomas is not ""canonical"", just read one verse from the text. Go read verse 114, the final verse, and you will learn all you need to know."

3251	443	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"Very good intro to the Gospel of Thomas. Another issue that the Fathers of the Church also had trouble with, is that although there were parallels with the four canonical Gospels, there are great portions of its theology that do not mesh well with early Christian theology. You can see this in its Anthropology. In the Gospel of Thomas Jesus is recorded as saying that all women must become men to enter the Kingdom. This does not respect Gn 1:27 where God created man in his own image, ""male and female He created them."" So there are some gnostic influences within the text even though scholars can not ascribe it to any particular gnostic school. In any case there was enough problems with the Gospel of Thomas for the early Church to abandon the text."

3255	447	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It is not there because when the Canonization of the bible came about in Nicaea the gospel of Thomas did not lend itself to the narrative those politicians and clergy of the day wanted to push upon the people. Yes, the bible was constructed as was the Koran decades if not centuries after the death of the principle ideologue they wanted you to worship. Yes both were political moves expressly so that those in power could remain in power and maintain control of a new burgeoning belief system.

3261	453	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	He left out the earliest anti-gnostic Christian writer. Read Iraneus' Against Heresies, in which he details gnostic beliefs and precisely why they are false in light of Holy Scripture. Thomas was one of the early gnostic writings from when much of their mythology was still undeveloped, but it IS a gnostic text. The reason it was left out of Scripture is not because it was unpopular, but because the Christian churches copied and kept only writings known to have been written by an Apostle or a close associate thereof. For example, Matthew and John were both Apostles, Mark was a close protégé of Simon Peter, and Luke was a protégé of both Peter and Paul. Antilegomina texts were not known to be apostolic, but were overtly Christian. Thomas and other gnostic writings were never even candidates for inclusion in the Cannon. Also, given that gnostic mythology was so highly developed by Iraneus' day, gnosticism must have started pretty early in the 2nd century. However, an informed reading of John's Gospel and his first epistle will perceive an effort in his part to refute proto-gnostic heresies that had just started to become popular and infiltrate the fringes of the Christian church.
3262	454	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	the gospel of thomas is not a gospel...a gospel is a type of biography...it is a list of sayings

Otherwise, they will kill you as they will to Mohammedans. If the Father of the Third Panth Khalsas Royal King Gobind Singh Ji never visited Harmandir Sahib, the Complex of Sikh Bhagtan, Bhai Ghaniyia Ji and Nirmalle Santan Akal Takht of Brahmin Varn, both of them do not ply swords as Khalsas and hired Shiv Sena do, then why today these Satanic people with swords are entering the Sikh Temples of the Second Panth? Also, women were not given Amrit. Mai Bhago Ji was not baptised. I have the answer in Deh Shiva Var Mohe............ Wake up and fanaticism will lead you to your deaths as during 1947 and 1984 when the terrorist Bhindranwala entered this Holiest of Holy in the world Complex with Guns. Sikhs are twice-born people of SURTTI and not the once-born fanatics. Sikh is a Naadi Roop and not a Bindi Roop of the super bastard fanatic devils - John 8v44. First Satguru was Jesus and Nanak the Second and greatest of all. There are Four Panths and Four Takhts to look after the affairs of the Four Varnas. In Kalyug, Shankar Varn of religious fanatics appears and this is the DamDami Taksaal, where the youngsters are brain-washed. Why Ten Lights in Sikhism? There were six Satgurus, the sons of Most High, who were not allowed to take the life of any and Four Sache Patshah, who were allowed to take life. Sache Patshah Har Gobind Ji entered this Complex in the name of Har and in the name of Gobind; he constructed the Loh Garh Killah. Think of it properly. Bhindranwala was neither a Sikh that instead of presenting the other cheek, he carried Guns and nor a Khalsa of Sache Patshah Gobind Singh Ji. Remember Sache Patshah Har Gobind Ji did not organise the Third Khalsa or the Fourth Nirmallae Santan but He Laid the Foundations of the two on Upkari basis. Royal King Gobind Singh, the very ROOP of Akal Purakh, then organised the PAR UPKARI Khalsas, the Fauj of Akal Purakh and Nirmallae Sant, the Apostles of Akal Purakh. Both of them are purely spiritual of the order of Melchizedek Sadhu. A Sadhu is never a married person but solitary. Miran Bhai and not Behan were also solitary. If the Khalsas were married people, then they would have kept the Begums of Ahmed Shah Abdali to themselves. The state of Kapurthalla was offered to TATT Khalsas but they refused to accept it and told the person to give it to the man looking after their horses. Khalsas rule over our hearts and not Land. Lala Banda Bahadur, a Sodhi Khatri was a Munnmukh Khalsa whilst the Forty Muktae was BaeMukh Khalsas. BaeMukh earned their forgiveness but not the Munnmukh. Chaudhry Ranjit Sandhu Brar was given the rule for 40 years and showed his devotion but in great Foolishness. Satguru Ram Dass Ji refused to accept Landed property for Harmandir Sahib, this Foolish Jatt allocated lands to Gurdwaras as well to breed greedy Mahant. Greedy Khatris enjoyed Gold plating to Harmandir Sahib making it a place of attraction than of learning as that of Bhagat Farid Ji in Faridkot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxb4CfhPxd8 Vaisakhi Celebration:- http://www.gnosticgospel.co.uk/vaisakhi.htm Bhindranwala was neither a Sikh nor a Khalsa but a TERRORIST.

3290	482	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	To suggest the NT as we have it today wasn't a 'top down' compilation makes no historical sense. While I'm sure the powers that won did take into consideration some of what the general Christians of the 4th century were reading, they also omitted many that were popular. They were intent on making sure their view of Christianity won out over many other views at the time. And, in making sure of that, they made sure no books were included that could be used against what they wanted.

3292	484	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Thank you for making this video. I'm grateful for you. I'm reading the Gospel of Thomas tonight!
3293	485	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	What it can't help you relate to the Living Christ Jesus... That makes no sense they are words of wisdom from Jesus.. not a story of his life. If you are a Christian you want to understand spiritually the Gospel of Thomas, which has huge spiritual significance.
3294	486	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I read that the main reason why there are only four gospels is because of an idiotic and superstitious bishop said since there were only four cardinal points and four winds in nature, so too must there be only four gospels..... can you believe it??
3295	487	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	P.S. Did you look in to the Seals of Solomon and the legends of his magical power e.g. summoning/controlling demons etc.?
3296	488	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The Gospel of Thomas is not about the historical Jesus. It is about what he lived and taught. Look where the finger is pointing, not at the finger.
3297	489	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"Do you know what this means? Jesus said, ""I myself shall lead her in order to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every woman who will make herself male will enter the Kingdom of Heaven."" If not you will not enter the Kingdom and are in darkness."

In a major research project lasting from 2012 to 2016; former government investigator, intelligence analyst & code-breaker, J.R. Watts, spearheaded efforts to determine if Christ's disciples encoded their Gospels with clues about the SHROUD OF TURIN. What he discovered was an ingenious tapestry of null ciphers & jargon codes, concealed in the Biblical plaintext that camouflaged a ciphertext & was arrayed in diffused layers of cryptic data. They described the SHROUD in a series of intermittent signals; symbolic references, disguised metaphors & phonetically spelled ciphers, with the common denominator being JESUS' IMAGE ON THE SHROUD. Watts used the same code-breaking techniques the CIA & NSA use when cracking codes; such as pattern recognition, quantitative data analysis, detection of graphical deception, cluster analysis, data mining, deductive logic, frequency analysis & camouflage signaling. Jesus' disciples layered the Bible with sly patterns of direct & indirect HINTS about the Shroud that theologians & Shroud experts; ignorant of cryptology, were blind to. Cornerstones traditionally contain HIDDEN time capsules & like a TIME CAPSULE, the Shroud contains the IMAGE of the STONE the builders rejected. Watts also points to many Old Testament PROPHECIES that foretold of God's creation of the Shroud. Hidden in the ABSTRACT OF AMBIGUITY, these prophetic codes OBSCURED THE MEDIUM on which Jesus' image existed: the Shroud. J.R. proves the Shroud was the SAME LINEN CLOTH the Gospels kept hinting to in the most tantalizing ways imaginable. Watts also exposes the HARBINGERS of 9-11 that even RABBI JONATHAN CAHN missed: 3,000 Jews killed in 1 DAY in Exodus 32 due to the Golden Calf sin, followed by the giving of the Ten Commandments a 2nd time on SEPT. 10th. New York City repeated this act of defiance in 2000 with the New Millennium Cow Parade, resulting in 3,000 more murders in ONE DAY on SEPT. 11th!

3301	493	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"The Gospel of Thomas is, Awesome! It's probably the better way for God-realization in this era... You're What You Eat! Jesus said, ""Blessed is the lion which becomes man when consumed by man; and cursed is the man whom the lion consumes, and the lion becomes man. This heaven will pass away, and the one above it will pass away. The dead are not alive, and the living will not die. In the days when you consumed what is dead, you made it what is alive. When you come to dwell in the light, what will you do? On the day when you were one you became two. But when you become two, what will you do?"" (7&11). And, for the serious seekers, the Truth may set them free... All glories unto Lord Jesus Christ"

3304	496	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The gospel of Thomas found near Egypt preached by the pope excepted by Rome and suddenly it's approved by many as authentic because the use of words sound close to the gospel of Christ! My intuition tells me it's a fraud and it just so happens the satan is playing catch ups. No disrespect to those who's faith is in Thomas teachings. God never makes mistakes.
3305	497	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I am so grateful I stumbled upon your channel! :)
3306	498	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	was there really a dude name Thomas in ancient palestine? sounds fishy
3307	499	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	No...very blind people are on both sides of the debate. I wouldn't recommend listening to any of them. If you understand the canonical gospels correctly you will understand that the Gospel of Thomas is 100% truth regardless of when, where, and/or who wrote it. Seek and you will find...knock and it shall be opened unto you. PS...It doesn't happen over night and could take many many years.
3308	500	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"A group commissioned by Constantine decided for us which Gospels were ""God's Word"" and which, like the Gospel of Thomas, were ""heretical/bastard"". We cannot be skeptical nor question this bc that would show lack of Faith, without which we go to Hell. If and when we do apply the same critical thinking to the 4 Gospels that we use on Thomas, we discover that they read like mythology (zombie saints roamed Jerusalem en masse in Matt. 27, etc), draw their inspiration from common sources (rather than each word being directly inspired by God), contradict one another according to the theological intentions of the authors, and are written by men having nothing to do with the names we now ascribe to the Gospels. I begin to understand why we were discouraged from researching them for ourselves."
3309	501	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	The Question is , If they really did all these changes or composition to the books what about the others ? and how come people consider them still the closest words to what God Said ? Do People know there is something called the Quoran Which is not a Different religion ?
3310	502	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Jesus never exists its just energy. The christ thing is not a literal person it's a higher consciousness.
3311	503	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	so it's based on opinions to make it short
3312	504	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	So People want me to believe that the Gospel of Thomas is fake and that the four Gospels are real? But the four Gospels are each slightly different. I think the Gospel of Thomas is Genuinely the words of Jesus written down in his time. Its banned because the church dont like it...
3313	505	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	so i guess, its best to travel back in time to when Jesus walked the earth, interview Him, come back here and post the video on youtube.....
3314	506	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	It is real simple, God did not want it in the scriptures PERIOD
3315	507	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Hey we would like to hear something about the infancy of Jesus(infancy gospel of Thomas).
3316	508	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Is it possible that this gospel might just be a copy of the original? Just because the pages that were found date to only the 1st or second century doesn't necesarily mean it was origially written then.
3317	509	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	when searching for the truth historical Jesus is not important, what is important to me is that Jesus was pointing to something spiritual, mysterious, that knowledge of it would disturb a person at the beginning but then you would stand and marvel(and I know that he wasn't talking about the jahovah).
3318	510	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	Should really consider a hair cut
3319	511	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"The ""Holy Bible"" is just a bunch of bullshit, written in order to make people laugh or to make idiots out of people. The Gospel of Thomas is bullshit as well:) Here`s an example: (14) Jesus said to them: ""If you fast, you will put a sin to your charge; and if you pray, you will be condemned; and if you give alms, you will do harm to your inner spirits"". (27) Jesus said to them: ""If you do not fast, you will not find the kingdom"". So... now I really don`t know what to do. Should I fast? or maybe I shouldn`t fast?:))) I don`t wanna go to hell, so tell me what to do! Was Jesus drunk or stoned when He said such irrational things to people? Was Thomas drunk when he wrote this gospel? or maybe I`m just an analphabet who cannot read?:) I will be grateful for the answers:)"
3320	512	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	"You don't need to read the entire Gospel of Thomas to know that it is heretical. The first saying is a confirmation in itself. Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death could be interpreted to mean ""shall not perish but have everlasting life"", but the Bible based that on the belief in Jesus, not on knowledge of something secret."
3321	513	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I think you may have missed something. could it not be more than just the four gospels had a fan club. but it did not fit with the Constantines and the counsel of nicea vision for his one religion.
3322	514	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	couldn't it be possible that the Gospels of Luke and Matthew borrowed from the gospel of Thomas?
3323	515	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I think you said your expertise was more in the area of early Christianity, so it might be a bit outside your wheelhouse, but have you thought about doing a video on the Investiture Controversy?
3324	516	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	woah, I'm not used to hearing your voice without background music
3325	517	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQ0w_f5P2s	I understand you are not approaching your videos in a orthodoxy/heresy manner, but do you as an individual believe in such as thing as orthodoxy and heresy? I understand teaching it may be more helpful not to use those labels but do you believe there is such a thing or is it all just diversity and that's all?
3326	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Is it fair to assume that Christianity was invented by the Romans. To me , simplified. They the Romans took Judaism and made their own religion. Christianity. One could argue apart from the pagan religions ,both Christianity and Islam where born from Judaism. I'm not an atheist. If you would assign me , I would be church of England, or Protestant. I'm not religious, nor am i an Atheist. I am only interested the history.
3327	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Another video trying to paint Christianity as this holy believe of a religion because of it's Judaism affiliation & background, when meanwhile Christianity is the reason why the world is so horribly wrong....it persecuted non-believers, created slavery & colonisation, evils that are still felt in the world today. Christianity & Judaism are universal apart in my view.
3328	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Parting of the ways happened in AD 34 when the 490 years allotted to the #Jews expired. Daniel 9:24; Ezekiel 4:6; and Acts 13:45-46.

3332	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	The main difference between Judaism and what Christians believe is that Judaism belief that the Messiah/Christ has not yet came and Christians believe in the return of the Messiah/Christ and that is Christ Jesus.
3333	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"The Jewish religion didn't part ways with the ""Christian religion"". It never recognized it as a legitimate ""religion"", and as it developed it was considered blasphemy and in violation of the first three of the Ten Commandments as well as a violation of the overall strict belief in One God (yeah, I know about the Holy Trinity and all that. Seems a too-easy dodge around One God, idols and all). It was the Jewish leaders of the newly established ""Christian Religion"" who separated. After they took a vote at the convention at Nicea, Greece in AD (ACE) 325 to determine if Jesus was Divine or not (Divinity won in a close vote) and later at Constantinople in AD (ACE)381 when more ""holy"" doctrine such as the Trinity (not appearing in any Biblical text) was voted on, they tried for the next 1,626 years or so to write the Jews out of history, both figuratively and literally by murdering and cruelly persecuting as many of them as they could whenever they had the chance - just like Jesus would have done and wanted them to do. According to the myth, the ""facts"" that Jesus and the Disciples and all were orthodox, penitent Jews, the Last Supper was a Passover Seder (at which there would not have been anything like bread), and lots more are not only conveniently ""forgotten"" or unknown by many Christians, but is an embarrassment to many as well."
3334	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Didn't Islam spring out of a Judeo-Christian sect that saw Jesus as a prophet? Actually, no one who isn't anonymous on here should answer that.
3335	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	The Talmud officially denouncing Jesus was probably a turning point. Not sure when that was added though.
3336	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	What evidence or what do we really know about Christianity in the first century
3337	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"""Jesus was jewish..."" Imma head out chief, I really can't undersneed that position"
3338	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	To me the idea that another human being (saints,popes,preists) can erase your sin seems un godly to me .
3339	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Jesus was a Hebrew, not Jewish. Mistranslation of scripture.

3344	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Christianity and Judaism has never parted ways. You are very mis informed. After the uniting of church and state (538AD) by the early Roman, now called Catholic Church, Christians who practiced Saturday sabbath keeping (as in Jewish law practice with the belief in Jesus Christ the messiah) were forced to go into hiding. They were given the name Sabbatarians until they were eventually forced to re emerge in society hiding along side Protestants who worshipped on Sunday during the Protestant Reformation in Europe to America. The practice of Jewish sabbath keeping and messiah worship, then re emerged as a distinct class of religion once again in the mid 1800s around 1860 in the United States of America after the great upset of 1844 and the false decleration of the second coming of Christ. The freedom of worship in America allowed them to gain popularity throughout the next century. This religion is now called Seventhday Adventist and it is one of the biggest Jewish Christian practising denominations in the world, falling shortly behind the Catholic denomination. If you are having trouble understanding this then I would like to invite you to read a book called the great controversy by the author Ellen White. She has provided many historical documentations on this subject and it might even change your view about how the bible is being miss interpreted.

3347	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Definitely by 315CE when chieftains gained some political power for the first time and immediately used it to institute anti-Semetic laws. That said, the oldest reference we have for Christianity as a distinct thing was about 111CE
3348	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	I Am Hindu, Its always Interesting for me to learn About other Religions 🙏
3349	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Saul's (I refuse to call him by the other name) job was to persecute Jews. I believe he continued as a double-agent of sorts, infiltrating the Jesus movement, and twisting their doctrine until even they threw him out, sending him back up north, where they thought he couldn't do any more harm. They couldn't have been more wrong...
3350	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Regardless of the separation, Jews and Christians pray to the same God. That's the important thing we need to realize.
3351	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Jewish texts? The Gospels are all written in koine Greek. Marcus and Lucius are Roman names
3352	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	I hate to bring this up here but Christianity actually has nothing to do with Judaism except the people who made it were probably Jews. The old testament has nothing to do with Christianity either. Actually strictly speaking Judaism is an ancient canaanite religion derived from the worship of the chief god El. The Jewish god, Yahweh Elohim, is the son of the chief god El and like most canaanite regions was only the patron god of the israelites not the only God. Historically we know this because Jews were polytheistic until 500ishbc when king Josiah outlawed the worship of other gods. I know this is an Earth shattering claim for some Jews and christians, but it's agreed upon historical fact. People just don't talk about it because it makes people uncomfortable. Coincidentally this is the reason for the tone shift between the old and new testament. They're two different religions. Actually Christianity is probably more derived from eastern dharmic religions and zoroastrianism than Judaism especially if you focus strictly on the teachings of Jesus Christ specifically. Think about the similarities between the teachings of Jesus Christ and the teachings of the buddah Siddhartha Guatama, eerily similar. This brings me to my final point regarding Christianity. Many people have a misunderstand of jesus's sacrifice thinking it's when he died on the cross, but that's not it. Jesus's sacrifice was being born into the material world. He sacrificed oneness with the father to come to earth and teach us how to escape the material world. I think most people completely misunderstand the teachings because there is so much emphasis on the sacrifice being the dying on the cross. That wasn't a sacrifice from jesus's perspective though because he was eager to return to the father after completing the teachings/sacrifice.
3353	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"Did Jesus ever say he was a jew, did Peter, Paul, Mark, Luke, or John ever say they were jews? Did Mary or Joseph ever say they were jews? Magi came baring gifts foe the ""MESSIAH"" were they jewish? Magi could have been shamen of any religeon. Some of the BOOKS that religeous people had in thier collection/bible of books said that the creator was less than pleased with his creation of humans."
3354	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Simple Answer - 1 when the Christians decided Jesus was G-d . Paul WAS NOT JEWISH - In fact Paul knew nothing at all about Judaism other than that he hated it. None of the New Testament books are Jewish texts. They are Christian texts and are generally anti-Jewish and always incorrect.
3355	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	I believe that Judaism and Christianity started parting ways when people in Palestine started to believe that God was not angry and needed to be propitiated with sacrifices at the Temple, but loved you irrespective and unconditionally. The other point of departure was the understanding that the kingdom that Jesus preached about was one of the mind and the soul, not a temporal one. So this made it perfectly possible for the Christians to live patiently under the Roman yoke and to not be ripped off when going to the Temple and being forced to exchange their real money for some overpriced religious coins,so that defenceless animals could be slaughtered to pacify that God the Sanhedrin were so fond of invoking.
3356	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	From a Scriptural point of view, Israel was blinded (Ro 9-11) and temporarily cast aside (stoning of Stephen [fall of Israel] beginning acts 7 (in full effect acts 28) until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in[end of the dispensation of grace]; the middle wall of partition was taken down in acts 9 with the conversion of Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus when Jesus chose him as the Apostle of the Gentiles and dispensed to him as a chosen vessel the Mystery that was hid in God kept secret from ages and from generations since the foundation of the world. Acts is a transition book from what was spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began, the twelve's kingdom gospel (12 Apostles for 12 tribes) to Paul's kept secret from ages and from generations, hid in God from the foundation of the world Mystery Gospel (1 Apostle for 1 body of Christ) Paul said about his own conversion and his persecution of the jewish church: 18 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. GALATIANS 2 16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 1 TIMOTHY 1 10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. 1 CORINTHIANS 3 One can only understand the scriptures by taking them literally, and using the key 2 Timothy 2:15, only in the Authorized Version(kjb). Context is everything when it comes to understanding the Bible. GENESIS to John= Israel/law/kingdom Act=transition ROMANS to Philemon=now/dispensation of grace/body of Christ Hebrews to Revelation= tribulation/Israel/kingdom Israel as a nation is temporarily spiritually blinded, and individually God has concluded all men in disbelief so that he can have mercy on all through belief in the gospel. Through the covenant Gentiles had to get saved by going through Israel, today each individual (regardless of nationality) can be saved simply by trusting in Christ's atoning sacrifice and glorious resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:1-4) at least once in your life time. Don't miss the catching up/redemption of the purchased possession. 25For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. 26And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: 27 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. 28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes. 29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. 30 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: 31 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. 32 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.

They expected a Messiah that would crush Rome and their enemies. Christ didn't come to destroy Rome. The whole world is Rome. He showed us how to live in a wicked, corrupted world and to be in it but not of it.

This has been seen as a kind of point that burned the bridge between Judaism and Christianity.
3361	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	I love this concept of how religion is very delicate and when talking about Christianity and Jewedisum (belief over practice) is very compelling but the one thing that isn't clarifying identity is the origin of nationality and what defines or is unique to that nationality and culture. For example, we talk about Jews and the unique customs and rituals that make that group of people unique, but then you compose those rituals and customs onto those who don't identify themselves as Jewish, which is what Christianity has done to most of the known world.

3370	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Andrew Mark Henry, you seem to present the 'parting' of Judaism and Christianity from a strictly Christian perspective. What about the Jewish view of Christians, especially in light of the Council of Jamnia in 74 CE (or 85 CE per another commenter) in which assembled rabbis declared that followers of Jesus could not legally be called Jews (especially for the purpose of obtaining the Roman legal exemption granted to followers of Jewish religion)?

3377	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	When most people think they are thinking, they are really only rearranging their prejudices. I have the advantage of knowing that’s what I’m doing. Everyone is introduced to certain prejudices by their parents and their friends. Most people are also influenced by the wider culture in which they live. The question, then, is whether to spend our time attempting to reinforce the prejudices we acquired when we were young or whether to study history while open to the possibility that there may be flaws in the worldview of our parents or our friends. It is a scary proposition to question what we were taught because - especially in the twenty-first century - it risks alienating our family or our friends if they (or we) fail to learn how to discuss such things without arguing. The subject of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity is especially difficult because of the different ways that people understand specific words - words that are almost impossible to avoid when addressing this subject. Religion Hebrew Israelite Jew/Jewish Christian Some people use the word “religion” to refer to traditions. Some people use that same word to refer to the beliefs, practices and prohibitions promoted by a religious organization. Other people use that same word to refer to the beliefs, practices and prohibitions of any individual - whether or not those things are considered traditional and whether or not those things are promoted by a religious organization. Some people use the words “Hebrew” and “Israelite” as synonymous. Some people - including yours truly - take certain statements by John the baptist, Jesus and St. Paul as indicating that a person who is an Israelite only in the sense of being a physical descendant of Israel (aka Jacob) or only in the sense of participating in certain religious rituals is not really an Israelite at all - i.e. only those who have the faith of Abraham, Isaac and Israel are truly Israelites. I confess that the instruction my parents gave me did not include the division of Israel after the death of Solomon. So I am sympathetic with people who don’t understand the origins of the words “Israelite” and “Jew”. It makes me cringe, however, when I hear someone refer to the people Moses led out of Egypt as “Jews”. There is no record - biblical or otherwise - of anyone referring to a descendent of Judah as a “Jew” until hundreds of years after the Exodus. Please let me propose an alternative to the question of how “Jewish” Christianity is or how “Jewish it ought to be. Maybe what we should be asking is whether we can accept as true Christians those people who practice specific rituals that were unique to the Hebrews before the birth of Jesus. I submit that there is a huge difference between the argument as to whether such practices are required for Christians (see Acts 15) as compared to the question of whether such practices should be prohibited among Christians. That second idea - that the instruction given to the children of Israel through Moses and other Hebrew prophets of antiquity should be prohibited among Christians unless expressly promoted by Jesus or the apostles - was developed during the centuries when believers in Jesus were trying to live alongside pagan Romans who hated the Hebrews. Are there aspects of traditional Judaism that are not biblical? Of course. Traditional Judaism is biblical as interpreted by rabbinical traditions. There are many professed Christians who consider Christianity to be biblical as interpreted by ostensibly Christian traditions. But if Christianity is a personal religion - not merely an institutional one - it is up to each Christian to study the biblical evidence for ourselves and each of us decide for ourselves whether the instruction through “Moses and all the prophets” (Luke 24:27) is applicable in the twentieth-first century.

Just from hearing what is known from the video, a decent answerable question might be ""When did most Christians start going strictly to Christian churches, and cease religious congress with Jews, for a given place?""

3386	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	not sure about taking the very extreme splinter groups so much into consideration, they seemed to have very little influence, like today local sects have. also, the split does start to show up already early on, see paul being present at the stoning of stephanus; in revelations we find stories of problems between jewish synagogues and christians. and lets not forget the special status of jews in the roman empire, being exempt from ritual sacrifice, and their panic when christians started to spread the religion across non-born jews. until the separate identity became popular, and was name-coined and wrote up, the schism may have already been bigger.
3387	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Personally, I see it more as a reformation than a clean break, hence why no particular date can be set as to when they 'split' as the reformation took place over several centuries.

3396	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Great job. The Ebionites were virtually indistinguishable from Judaism except for belief that Jesus was the Messiah. But you might want to mention that they were distinguishable from all other Christians because they also rejected Paul and his writings as apostate. When Constantine as the Ponitifex Maximus of the religions at Rome exercised authority over Christianity, he forced doctrines antithetical To the Ebionite values that still dominated Christianity. Because Paul’s words were helpful to changing Sabbath from Sabbath to the venerable Day of the sun, who was the God which Constantine worshiped known as Sol Invictus, Paul became very valuable and was now being elevated as of 325 AD. This turned the church into a heresy hunter and persecutor of people who still wanted to rest on Sabbath, wanted to celebrate Christ’s Resurrection at Passover instead of on the day of the goddess Easter known as Osiris in Latin and Easter in Saxon, and to also persecute those who rejected Jesus was God. The Easter ruling is overlooked but is one of the most important decrees at the Nicaea conference of 325 AD. In that conference for the first time, Constantine also enforced the deity of the son of God which was a means of Constantine promoting Jesus to a figure almost indistinguishable from Sol Invictus whom Constantine remained attached to until his death. Search for Constantine’s Damage to Christianity for background and scholar references.

3399	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Not enough research. The split happened in the 1st century. The teaching of Jesus and his 12 apostles already contradicted with apostle Paul. Matter of salvation, gospel theme, Jewish heritage. The Nazarenes, the very first Christians (big part of them were Essenes) who later were called Ebionites (the poor ones, although some scholars consider them different from Nazarenes) had a very different belief system than Paul. For them he came up with a new gospel/teaching. Today's Christianity is based on Pauline doctrine. About 4th century they were already accused in heresy for having Jewish beliefs. By the way, according to the Bible apostle Paul was accused by the authorities being in connection with Nazarenes, although he wasn't connected to them and actually repeatedly acted against them. The church tried really hard to get rid of the hebraic roots and they succeeded. However, a lot of Christians today are awakening and realizing that they should go back to the original faith.
3400	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Council of Jerusalem in AD 49 where Jewish traditions such as the Jewish Law was adandoned for the Doctrine of Grace. This is an easy question with a distinct answer found in Scripture.
3401	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"I think Roman law really made the separation ""stick"". During the Neronian persecutions, Jews still fell under the protection of Roman law that protected their ""strange"" practices of not worshipping Rome. However, Christians, at least in Rome, no longer were concerned by Rome to have that Jewish protection. Jews in Rome were quick to point out these ""legal"" differences. When the Flavians destroyed Jerusalem, they also took away the protection of Jews. Christians did not fall until the censorship of the Flavian destruction of Jewish political power. This was reinforced with the 135AD Bar Koch defeat until Hadrian. Jewish just became a strange believing diaspora. Christians did not fall under this policy. Indeed by 135 AD, Rome treated the weird Christians and the strange Jews as two different troublesome groups within the empire. Since religion is just another political avenue of controlling the masses, we should really use the legal views of the Roman empire to determine when the two groups split rather than the strange doctrinal beliefs of the two groups. As you pointed out, early Christianity had many internal strange and stranger to really weird beliefs. Jews also had many internal doctrinal changes. The one constant during this period is how they were perceived by Roman law."

3403	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"I think you're muddying the waters by including every splinter group no matter how small or off the main branch. The question was answered in the Book of Acts by the surviving Apostles themselves. Paul (aka Saul of Tarsus) specifically mentions how the new faith called The Way is for both Jews and Gentiles. He makes that distinction and when his new Greek followers are told by the Jewish followers of the Way that they must first convert to Judaism and be circumcised first. In the Book of Acts, the apostle Peter has a dream about clean and unclean and Jesus tells him in the dream that the old markers of Judaism are gone. Peter then holds the Council of Jerusalem and it is agreed that one need not ""convert"" to Judaism or be circumcised in order to follow The Way of Jesus."

3417	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	You don't mention the three Jewish wars which were major events in the life of the Roman Empire. The Great Jewish War which ended in 70 with the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple, then there was the Jewish rebellion centered around Cyrene in what's now Libya and elsewhere outside of Israel around 113 - 115 and was evidently very boody - the city of Cyrene never recovered from this uprising. Finally there was the Bar Kochba Revolt of 132 to 135 which required major Roman forces to defeat it. Jews were seen by many in the Roman Empire as enemies, many Christians (those who accepted Jesus as the Messiah or part of G-d of either Jewish or Gentile background) wanted to distance themselves from the pesky Jews. I was surprised you made no mention of Pella, still it was an interesting video.

3421	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	You seem to just ignore the issue that Jews are ethno-religious identity not just a religion. even today there are many similarities between Jews and Christians. I think as soon as an author was able to distinguish between the two groups and it made sense to his readers, that was the point that Christianity and Judaism diverged. I.e. you can still call Christianity a sect of judiasm, just a particularly radical one. As soon as heresy was proclaimed, the two groups were to be considered separate groups. Thanks for the informative video!
3422	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	My understanding is that both Islam and Christianity are sects of Judaism.
3423	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	@ReligionForBreakfast the only difference between Judaism and Christianity are theological differences. Ebionites and Marcionites were heretical groups that diverged from Christian orthodoxy we know this because Pauls letters were some of them earliest writings in Christianity and with Pauls letter we have the earliest Christian creed and throughout Pauls letters there was affirmation of his divinity. That being the case the ideals of heretical groups were incongruit with Pauls letters
3424	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	The New Testament letters are mostly encouragement to the churches about not following the circumcision party. Which were people who believed they had to be circumcised before believing in Christ basically.

3431	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"You can see the beginnings of the separation within Paul's writings. There were those God Fearers that Paul addresses and grabs hold of that are intrigued by Sunday worship (2 Corinthians 9), having no forbidden foods (Romans 14), no castration - Galations (uhhmm... circumcision) etc. You can see some historical evidence in Suetonius as he records a disruption in Rome in 49AD because of a ""Chrestus"" (Acts 18?). The Jewish Synod of Jamnia expels ""Christians"" in 85AD. There's even some tiny evidence in the Pastoral Epistles of the beginnings of Gnostics. Most of these things take place in the first century. In summary there was probably never a one time email or communique that went out over the wire. It was one synagogue at a time that were getting fed up with these Gentile Jewish people. It was each house/business church set up by Gentiles that had no real connection with Jewish people. to be more visibly different groups. However, as mentioned in the above video, there was never a time where all of the groups acted cohesively in separating. Lastly, remember, there was the destruction of Jerusalem around 70AD (typing this without notes). This scattered many Jewish people and broke up communities. Aside from Nero's persecution (argued by some) most Roman or Roman province Gentile Christians began to thrive unimpeded. Many suggest that by the first decade of the so-called second century, those that were Gentile Christians easily outnumbered those that still identified themselves as Jewish as they had no Jerusalem or synagogues to attend."
3432	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	If Jesus Christ was jewish then how come he spoke Aramiac an not hebrew? All Middle East jews at that time spoke hebrew. jews don't accept converts as it's a very 'tribal' religion. I know they're accepting converts nowadays (a rigorous process) but 2000+ ago they didn't.

3437	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	I am an Ebionite / Talmidi Jew, allied to the tradition of James the Just (see www.talmidi.co.il); we consider our split with Paul's Christianity at the Council of Jerusalem in about 49 or 50CE, and our split with Judaism in the mid-90's CE, as a result of the Birkat ha-Minim ('benediction of the heretics'), and the rulings of the Council of Yavneh. We consider Paul to have been a convert to Judaism, he was not a Pharisee, but a captain of the High Priest's police (if Paul claims he was a Pharisee, yet took orders from the High Priest to hunt for and arrest Jewish followers of Jesus, what on earth was a Pharisee doing taking orders from a Sadducee? It's like Billy Graham taking orders from the Pope)! We do not consider ourselves 'Christians'; to us, a 'Christian' is a follower of Paul; we are Followers of the Way - followers of Yeshua and James the Just.

3455	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"The single most important thing to remember is that the Greek word for *Christ* is just a translation of the Hebrew word for *Messiah.* Thus ""Jesus Christ"" is the Greek way of saying the Hebrew for ""Joshua-the-Messiah"". Note that the real name of Jesus was always the Hebrew name *Joshua,* and the name Jesus we have today is just a mistranslation of the original name of Joshua. So the Greek ""Christ"" can refer to any Messiah at all, not just Joshua, and the Romans dealt brutally with several Jewish Messiah cults - or Christ cults - in the first and second centuries. The most important besides Joshua-the-Messiah was Simon bar Kochba-the-Messiah, which in the Greek language would be Simon-Christ, and his second-century followers would be ""Christians"" in the Greek language just as much as followers of the Joshua of the previous century were ""Christians"" too. From the point of view of the Greek speaking Romans there was no important distinction between any specific Jewish Messiah claimant, and they would be unlikely to have the inclination to care - they were all just Jews following one of their various Messiahs to a Roman soldier. During the Roman supression of Simon-the-Messiah in the second-century, the Romans became so anti-Jewish that it was virtually certain that they were killing followers of both Joshua-the-Messiah (aka Jesus-Christ followers) as well as followers of Simon-the-Messiah (Simon-Christ followers). After that second century bloodbath, the followers of Joshua were very motivated to distance themselves from the Jews who had followed other Messiah claimants by downplaying their Jewishness. This is likely the fundamental reason why modern Christians use Sunday as their main day of worship instead of Saturday - instead of the _actual_ Sabbath as required in their holy text. (The commandment to _keep the Sabbath holy_ has lost its original meaning to most modern Christians, often being reinterpreted as the next day, Sunday, instead.) By no longer following the Jewish practice of keeping the Sabbath holy according to their holy texts, they could forge a new identity for their particular Messiah worship - the worship of Joshua/Jesus - that had less and less to do with the original Jewish Messiah concept. Over the centuries following the Roman supression of Simon-Christ, the Jesus-Christ movement carved for itself a new Roman identity that wasn't explicitly at odds with the Roman Empire like the Jews were known to be. The end result of that new identity was the early Roman Catholic Church, which had an explicit hartred for Jews, plus it had also elevated their own Messiah Joshua to the status of a god. Elevating Joshua, better known as Jesus, to the status of a god actually followed the Roman practice of the elevation of real historical figures to the status of a god - for example Julius Caesar was elevated to a god by the Romans as well. Of course since Judaism was monotheistic the elevation of Jesus to a god caused a lot of strife within the new ""Christian"" religion, since it required its followers to believe that Jesus was his own father! But that's a whole other story ... 😂😂😂"
3456	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"Throughout scripture it is made clear that when the writers of the new testament use the word jew to describe somebody as to where they stand in there beliefs, they are saying they hold to Judaism. The apostles though being Jews, after the resurrection and being filled with the spirit identified themselves as believer rather then Jews. In Gal. 2:14 Paul said this to Peter "" But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"" Peter got caught up worrying about what the Judaizers would think rather then the truth of the gospel, And Paul had to rebuke him. Paul is saying to Peter, Though you are a Jew nationally, You are set free in Christ to live unto Him, Yet because you are afraid of what the Jew will think, you compromise the truth."
3457	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Yah but murder, annihilation, enslavement and hatred are the basic of Judaism religion and still acceptable by the Rabbis, but Jesus forbade them and deprived them of their roots! Judaism don't make any sense!

3459	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	The letters of Ignatius aren't even authentic and even 1Clement is anonymous. Neither had been written before 125 CE. So much of early Christian writings are late fabrications. Only the seven authentic letters (Romans, 1&2Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1Thessalonians, Philemon) of Paul can be said to have been written by a first century Jew. The rest of the Christian scriptures had been written by anonymous gentiles AFTER 80 CE. when the Birkut haMinim had forever separated the Nozrim and the Christians from the synagogues. It had been Paul who had begun Christianity at least 17 years AFTER his joining the Nozrim (Galatians 1:15-18, 2:1-2). Christianity had never been accepted by the apostles who, like Jesus, had lived and died as Jews. There was no such thing as 'Jesus followers'. Such a notion is an invention of the writer of Mark who had made Jesus out to have been a teacher with disciples. Believing that Jesus had been the Logos whose death had been an ultimate atonement for peoples' sins thereby abolishing the requirement of gentiles to be circumcised is what had made one a Christian. Believing that Jesus had been the messiah and had been resurrected due to the end times being upon the world is what had made one a Nozri. The Jewish Nozrim had never been Christians and the uncircumcised Christians had never been Jews despite living as Jews until their social separation from them sometime after 80 CE.

Those who repented and followed Christ and his Apostles were in the true faith those who did not remained in apostasy.
3464	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"Maybe, we wrongfully apply our modern conceptions of ethnicity upon what historically constituted a ""christian"" or a ""jew""."
3465	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Think of it this way. Yeshua was a rabbi and he taught at halikah to his disciples. His teachings were based on the his authority as the prophet that was to come as prophesied by Moses. Rabbinical teachings were based on the previous rabbi. Yeshua taught with authority. Many, many Jews believed on issues for the remission of sin, and continued to obey Torah and taught the Gentiles being grafted in to walk in Torah by the power of the Holy Spirit. They rejected the rabbinical laws and traditions. Paul taught against these traditions, but against the Torah, God's commandments. Paul lived a life obedient to Torah as noted in Acts. Yeshua was obedient to Torah. So the concept of Judaism should be understood in regard to the rabbinical traditions, not obeying Torah. Shalom
3466	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"Didn't Constantine align with a certain Christian sect prejudiced to the Jews? And wasn't that ""hate"" taught and didn't it grow from there? Separation is NOT taught scripturally. The Jewish Christians were expected to own their tradition and laws and leave the Gentiles alone- Acts 15 us where the official 1st Church of Jerusalem edict on that was delivered. And you cannot call Marcianism or Gnosticism ""Christian"" as the deny the accepted texts."
3467	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	lines of demarcation include Peter's confession of who Jesus was that is the Christ, Jesus claimed that he would build his church, Jesus death burial and Resurrection on Sunday, the beginning of the church in Acts chapter 2...
3468	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	I find this explanation rather unconvincing. Take Paul for instance. He recognized himself as persecutor of those who accepted Jesus as the Messiah, suggesting very strongly that mainstream Judaism (at least its Pharisaic sect) understood early christians to be something very distinct. It wouldn't be terribly out of place to imagine that a similar dynamic would play out if someone within judaism declared himself the messiah today. His acclaim would not be universal and pretty soon lines would be drawn around those who accept this individual as the messiah and those who do not. Indeed, the orthodox-judaizers (for lack of better distinction) debate is something that played itself within the early church for a long time, and if we read Ignatius (or perhaps even Chrysostom) along these lines we have a clearer picture of what was going on. The split between Judaism and Christianity may have happened very early (Paul in his roman letters already seems to recognize a difference) in history, but the internal dialogues between the different groups within early Christianity as to the role of judaic rites and practices within this new religion may indeed have taken much longer to become clear.
3469	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	It''s one thing to take examples of people such as early church fathers and scribes but original source characters such as Jesus or Moses and source documents such as NT or OT manuscripts may help hugely in differentiating Judaism from Christianity. It takes way more then just practices, but rather, core principles
3470	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Ok, so: when is the date we can be sure they were different religions, and viewed so by people then? Definitely before 1000 CE, right? The Khazars had to choose from Islam, Judaism and Christianity, for example.
3471	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	That is an easy question to answer. Judaism was based on the Law of Moses, which made conditions to be kept by Israel which they could not keep. It was good but impossible to keep. It became a ministry of condemnation and judgement on anyone under the law. The wages of sin is death. Christianity however, is based on salvation by Grace through Faith. Grace is the unmerited favour of God towards sinners who believe on the finished work of atonement accomplished by Christ on the cross. Christ has fully satisfied the wrath of God against sin and bore our sins in His own body on the tree. God has raised Him from among the dead. Christ now lives in resurrection life and is able to save completely all those who approach unto God by Him. Grace is a ministration of righteousness towards sinners. (2 Corinthians ch. 5 v 21). That means God bestows His righteousness on us when we believe. The Law and Grace could not remain together at the same time as they are both contrary one to the other. The Law condemns but Grace saves or bestows righteousness. Jew and gentile are now on a level playing field - we are all saved by Grace through Faith.
3472	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"This analysis keeps failing to distinguish Jewish nationality from Jewish religion. Christ and the people who followed Him were nationally and culturally Jewish. Christ said ""okay, the law of Moses is now fulfilled by my coming. I'm here to establish the higher law."" (Phase 2, if you will.) ""For example, no more sacrificing the unblemished lamb. That was symbolic of my coming and sacrifice. I'M the unblemished lamb now."" Those who followed him were Jewish in a national and cultural sense, but religiously they were the first and purest Christians. From there it took off but got twisted around into all flavors of modern Christianity. Jews and Christians have always had more in common than not."
3473	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"So early ""Christians"" were just Jews for Jesus."
3474	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	What about the conflict between Paul and James, brother of Jesus, regarding the admission of non-jews into christianity ? That seems to me a parting event, no matter which eventual later interactions happened between jews and christians.
3475	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"This is a very important topic and very well explained. Bravo. About the "" hypothetical Antiochene "" (4:03), you are right to consider him as a Jew, sociologically a Jew, because he most likely abides by the arbitrary prescriptions of the Torah - his ""religious"" practices. To believe that Jesus is the Messiah is not enough to be considered as a Christian (but it is a departure that can lead to a conversion) no more than to believe that Mary gives birth while still a virgin! Does this Antiochene believe that Jesus is God? Most likely not! His belief system is probably mostly Jewish! It requires a different system of beliefs giving full weight to the spirit of the Gospel (which undermines the Jewish sectarianism perpetuated by the Torah), to begin to act, to live as a Christian which means to abide by the Golden Rule in all his actions and with ALL humans (and even animals)! This universalization of the Golden Rule is the essence of the Christian spirit that emphasizes fraternity and charity. And to believe that Jesus is God is central because it is that belief that encourages us to take the gospel message very seriously (would only be because of the possibility of Paradises or Hell) and to allow it to shape human conduct. That doesn't mean that Christianity cannot be intolerant. It can but mostly to the sectarian spirit because this spirit opposes, in principle, the universalization of the golden rule."

3477	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	I have always considered when Paul writes about the Jews rejection of Jesus as Messiah as that pretty much being the demarcation line and division.Follow up related scriptures form a outline for doctrinal teachings, yes during the time of Pauline writings.What say ye, Andrew?Oh, also one need only look up at the cross as that divisive moment in History...
3478	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"""Then those who were scattered because of the tribulation coming about over Stephen, went about as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews only. But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, entering into Antioch spoke to the Greek speaking Jews, preaching the good news of the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord. And the word about them was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas to go as far as Antioch; who, arriving and seeing the grace of God, was glad, and encouraged them all with purpose of heart to continue with the Lord, for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord. And Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came about that for a whole year they assembled with the church and instructed many people. *And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.""* (Acts 11:19-26) The disciples of the messiah Jesus' teachings and 'Good news' of salvation, as related by the eyewitness apostles or their close peers, were called Christians. The apostles didn't teach a strict adherence to the Jewish ritualistic and ceremonial laws because that was not what imparted righteousness and these works were not tied to the name Christian. So the more gentiles became Christian the less it resembled Judaism obviously. And whilst some(Gentiles and Jews) accepted Jesus as the Messiah, some Jewish sects did not. And this is the dividing line of the two, not the practices the practices they did or did not do apart from their faith in Christ.."
3479	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Good content, presentation and insight. I've been trying to find the split early on. It seems the split grew more from Constantine on making neopaganism official policy of the Church. Islam in the 8th century wiped out many refusing to give up the Jewish roots of the Faith.
3480	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Wow, why was i not taught this in Sunday school!!!
3481	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	When did the Jews depart from the scriptures? When did the believers in Messiah depart from the scriptures? Those are the real questions. The terms Judaism and Christianity are misleading because they are the created religions of men, so what does it matter when they departed ways. What matters is when did they depart from the truth, the righteousness of Yahweh!
3482	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	If a Christian believes Jesus is the messiah, then wasn't Jesus a Christian? 🤔
3483	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"Maybe a better phrasing of the question would be ""When did Christians stop being Jewish?"" as there is nothing [I know of] about Judaism that precludes also holding Christian beliefs, but it was the early Christian movement that decided (after much debate) that Christian belief without Judaic practice was sufficient for a person to join the movement. So it's not a binary switch... the first Christians WERE Jewish, by its very nature, they didn't convert to Christianity, they added it. I think the question is far more important to Christianity than it appears at face value (""interesting for a historical perspective"") because coming to the Bible through the eyes of a Christian creates a lot of conflict when reading - what became seen as - the prequel. The modern Christian God is not all powerful, but became constrained by the concept of divine justice... God can only do good, therefore everything God does must be good... which makes reading the OT very confusing, and introduces ""the problem of evil"". If you read the bible the right way round rather than in the Star Wars order, you see instead a creator god who becomes increasingly good through the process of self-constraint, and if man is created in this image, a lesson in the development of moral code that is not a hard wired feature of the universe, as in the Zoroastrian (and Star Wars!) paradigm. In Judaism, it's simply not the role of the creator to enforce some contemporary human idea of justice, but it is the role of a people's descendants to feel the consequences of said people's actions. This confusion comes as a consequence of Christianity spreading outside Jewish circles as the importance of the context into which Christianity emerged was not transmitted, and context is everything."

The author of the Gospel of John already seems to partake in this partitioning, since he talks about ""the Jews"" instead of ""the Pharisees"". There is tension between Jesus and ""the Jews"", which implies that the author saw Jesus as something other than a Jew. Shouldn't this be mentioned, and could you clarify on it?"
3486	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	would you agree that a theological split began sometime during or after the destruction of the second temple.

3487	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	"Interesting question. We might pose the question toward today's ""Messianic Jews"" - are they Christian or Jewish or both? http://www.nvcc.edu/home/lshulman/project/western/MesJews.htm I have speculated on this question myself: In the first century there were ""Jewish Christians"" (Jewish followers of Christ) and non-Christian Jews (e.g. the Pharisees who were Jews who rejected Jesus as the Jewish messiah). Decades later, once Paul started converting Gentiles to be followers of the Christ, there were then Jewish Christians and non-Jewish Christians. Eventually, non-Jewish Christianity grew huge while Jewish Christianity faded away to almost nothing. http://www.nvcc.edu/home/lshulman/Rel232/resource/XianHistory.htm"

3492	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Quick question: do we have any idea who exactly Pliny is referring to when he's talking about the Christians? Is it a specific sect? In what ways was that sect (if it was at all unique) differ from Judaism so that Pliny called these people something different?
3493	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	The parting really happened with Paul who changed the actual story of the Jesus political movement advanced by Peter and the Jesus followers to a story that would be received much better in the gentile communities who were adherents of various mystery religions around the Mediterranean. He basically changed the Messiah (political) story of events into a religious story and so Christianity was invented.
3494	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDG5U0inNlE	Well it seems according to the account of the gospels of the Bible, the first Christians were in fact the messianic Jews, those among the Hebrews who keep the old laws and accept Jesus as the Messiah. So the man of the hypothetical Antioch was mostly a messianic Jew. The question is more rooted toward the practice and belief of the Gentiles and the Hebrews.

If a group of People believe in this agency, they Will develop a belief system surrounding these events. Culture then dictates how it Will evolve. Side note: I think I mentioned it somewhere before, but coping with a stressfull/dangerous environment might have something to do with forming religious beliefs. When a group of People try to cope with the struggles of their lifes, they might try to influence this agent and create an extensive religion surrounding it.

3502	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	The transition probably happened when we changed from hunter gathering to farming societies. As societies grew and developed, we had less to worry about predators and more about authority and power figures and influences. Cultural tokens passed down for generations transformed from animals to forest spirits and local deities which grew more intricate as they fused with social norms which valued order and respect. Authority figures like chiefs and local petty kings were symbols of higher power on Earth which came to reflect social and natural order which is why ancient kings were viewed as divine. So major gods worshiped represented a society's values and social statuses. It might be why something like ancient Greece had a plethora of bickering gods when ancient Greece was a bunch of warring city-states and why it eventually collected into the one god from the Hebrew bible and eventually Jesus as power in Rome became more and more focused in one figure as it transformed from a republic to the Principate to the Dominate. I admit this is a Western focus.

3505	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"I don't think the counterpoint studies hold water in this scenario. Modern people are indoctrinated with a ""placeholder religion"" of materialism and logical explanations for phenomena from an early age. Prehistoric people did not have this modern cultural tradition. Besides, just because the details of a religious tradition need to be taught, it doesn't follow that religion is wholly taught as a behavior. HADD stands as a clue that the brain has mechanisms eager to participate in a religious practice, mechanisms that existed for a very long time. Whether these mechanisms are responsible for the emergence of early religion or not, it does suggest that the human brain is indeed ""hardwired"" for religion in a real sense."
3506	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	The more I dig the more it seems apparent that religions are only social constructs.

3509	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"I don't feel like putting in a reply to someone else's comment, so I'm just gonna start up my own. I consent to the idea that modern organized religion is a social practice, but in my experience it is just as individualistic. Allow me to pull a few examples from the Christian Bible. If you look at many of the prophets in the Old Testament, many of them were shunned and threatened by their own people because they went against the flow, yet according to scripture they eventually came around due to the people having ""come to their senses"" as it were. The story of Jesus Christ is no different. In fact, Jesus wasn't the first ""messiah"" the Jewish leaders had to deal with. Any thoughts?"
3510	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	I'd say this explains superstition but not much more. The presence of God in a person's life goes way beyond HADD experiences.
3511	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	I have seen a lecture on the scientific theory of religion. There is such a theory and hadd is a small part of it.
3512	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	In islam it’s called Angel and Jinn who is always with you writing down what ever you are doing.
3513	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"I think that to anthropomorphize natural phenomena was their scientific approach to stuff. e.g. Violence is like tiger, must beware of tiger, must beware of tiger in people (violence in people). Tiger as a 'god' would be actually a way of thinking of ""a natural principle not binded by tiger.."". I think the spiritual is a model for similarities between observable phenomena."
3514	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	It's good to know about this theory, because it makes sense in a way, even though doesn't hold much water... Creates a really great discussion!
3515	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	Even from a Darwinian perspective, it's an evolutionary trait. All creatures evolve to become spiritual.
3516	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	Even Atheism is treated like a religion with fierce efforts to convert as many as possible.
3517	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	I think reducing religion to just names and faces is an error, so HADD is a very poor explanation. Not just because the social aspect explained in the video but also because philosophy and meditation(praying is considered one form of meditation) are important parts of any religion and cannot be explained by HADD (if anybody thinks praying is just asking the gods for favors, that totally misses the point). I think HADD may have contributed to giving faces to the and personalities to the deities or other mythological creatures, but that's just like the facade of religions, not the essence.
3518	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"I'd be careful about considering social constructionist as an explanation that ""defeats"" or is better than cognitive science. This quasi-Durkheimian approach is a tautological interpretation of religion at best and in its harder forms lacks serious evidence. It is a bit of a motte and bailey argument when you get into it, while cognitive science is already able to explain why it is that things like religion could be socially constructed in the first place."
3519	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"*+ReligionForBreakfast* A point of criticism about 8:48-9:10 Yes, obviously..cultural learning mechanisms are VERY important in shaping the content and place where religious form. That's not the claim of HADD either (i.e. it doesn't claim to describe how it happens, just suggests that HADD is at the forefront for the entire process, it allows it 'to go'). That's not a real argument against what HADD. That counter argument to HADD is, I think, akin to saying: ""the shape, slope, and surrounding features of the land (like reefs, rocks, islands, etc.), the trajectory of the ocean currents, and the force and direction of the wind are the factors that determine what the waves will look like, what direction they go, the height they will have and other things. Therefore we can brush away the moon and tidal currents as contributing to the explanation of the movements of seas and oceans."" I think it's missing the point entirely. I see it as HADD opening the door for personal/chance interpretations and other larger social forces (both in the moment and over looong stretches of time) to either discount/explain away or run with those HADD experiences. We certainly don't know how it all works, and I think focussing too much on those neuro-studies is going to be a red herring. We might see where it starts to happen, but locking people up in an ƒMRI for the entirely of belief-forming that can take quite long it's going to be practical. And to some extent, even if/when those devices become tiny and portable, you can only see where it happens - that doesn't necessarily tell you (why or) how it happens _like_ that."

3522	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	I love your videos and have great respect for your research. The HADD hypothesis sounds completely wrong to me. I like your comment about religion being social obligation but thought one of your older videos argued against this? It seems some of the oldest belief systems had to do with life after death. Many of us believe we have had contact with the Other Side through the deaths of loved ones. I had a profound experience in this regard, became very religious (Christian) and I have been a strong influence on friends seeking religion. That said, I had a deep spiritual crisis last year and dug ever deeper into religious history, etc. I feel I get greater understanding by listening to rabbis. One of them described knowledge and faith in G-d comes from humans contemplating, basically, infinity and the intensity of knowing that there is something very big, powerful and knowledgeable beyond us and our understanding. This rabbi also defined the Garden of Eden as describing human spirits in a sort of pre-existence, seeking knowledge which was a good thing in this telling. (I do not know if these are Kabbalistic beliefs or regular Judaism.) Some recent research has suggested that some ¨gods¨, for instance Greek gods, may have been actual people. While I do not agree with everything Graham Hancock puts forth, I think he has a strong point that humanity has basic amnesia with only slight and fabled memories, of a tremendous cataclysm in the past. He suggests comet strikes on the earth causing a rapid meltdown of the last ice age which brought on global floods. Perhaps part of religion is humanity trying to remember, some 12,000 years later, an un-explainable something that nearly wiped out life on earth. Finally, there are oddballs like me who have neurological conditions that cause us to have experiences with altered consciousness. My personal issue is chronic migraine and it causes me to occasionally see shadow people or animals. I know they do not exist but if I did, perhaps I would think to start my own religion. While understanding none of that is real. I DID have an out of body experience where I saw an event happening. I can actually prove this one but do not want to give the details here. I am not being coy. There is an ongoing criminal investigation. After that original experience, I occasionally have psychic experiences and know things before they happen. There seems to be an interconnectedness in the universe, in this dimension and perhaps in and to others. I believe the ancients and up to primitive societies of today, can feel and sense this thing to which quantum physics points but of which most of us have no understanding.
3523	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"""Instinctual response developed through our evolutionary proces as a species""...""As our species evolved in prehistoric times, it was to your advantage to be overly cautious for predators"" It's always so ironic to me to see historians (of religion) describe these ""historical dispositions"" in our ""past evolutionairy process"" with such certainty, ironically without any historical grounds for doin so. Evolutionairy psychologists seem to just be taking a presupposition that mankind evolved and continue trying to describe how everything else fits into that view. 'Oh humans have this characteristic...where could this have been useful to develop during our evolutionairy proces?' The theory basically seems to say our minds have been evolved to ""over-detect"" cause of the danger our ancestors faced. And there's a part of the brain, superior temporal sulcus, (known for processing social perception etc) that is active when we anthropomorphize things...Guess this brain part would be the result of Sabre-tooth fears?... And ofcourse every god is an anthropomorphization of the natural world as a result of this anti Sabre-tooth part of our brain. Thus religious belief is due to over-detecting agency which triggers a manmade creation of a deity(anthropomorphization) and cultural influence, which prob came to the religious belief by the same means, is socially conditioning these concepts. Aah, so seeing agency where there is not is evolutionairy hardwired in humans. Thus religious belief is evolutionary hardwired in humans. After all, seeing agency(overdetecting and anthropomorphing) where there is not is essentially what religious belief is right?... To me this video is a good example of how biased starting points can hijack sciences to get a particular outcome that can, cumulatively, eventually even influence pop-culture."
3524	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	I think the origin of religion has everything to do with what makes us different to other animals. Because while intelligent animals like dogs may have HADD and societal cues/obligations, they don’t have art or religion. What exactly makes us different from animals that allows us to think abstractly?
3525	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"Animals has HADD too, but I don't think they are religious. But we differ from other animals that we have a much deeper understanding of the future and the past, so we can ask ourselfs ""What hapens after we died?"" etc. Then we make up answers which becomes a part of our culture."
3526	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	I'm curious: what is the explanation for a sceptic converting to a faith, where there are no cultural pressures or groups? Or, say, a liberal surrounded by conservatives? Is there a theory for this?
3527	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	I read somewhere there is a G-d Gene in human DNA.
3528	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"Once again an amazing video full of food for thought! So, the whole idea of God, or to be more accurate, the need of believing to a higher deity or a higher purpose, or even believing that ""there must be something bigger out there"" derives from our quality of life. When you have a tough life, starting from the cave men fighting carnivores until today giving their daily struggle, you *have* to believe that somewhere must be something (call me Heaven, Paradise, Elysian Fields etc) in order to give meaning and reason to keep fighting this daily struggle. Believing in a higher power means hoping for a better life. Even if it's the afterlife, there must be something better, it cannot just end here. That's why usually rich people tend not to believe in a higher being. In case they do, it's definitely not the ""savior"" who will bring the salvation and redemption, it's more like a purpose to give justice to this world; that's why we see (very) rich people becoming philanthropists and humanitarians; they might believe in a higher power but as a meaning to this life, not to save them at the afterlife. Keep in mind for example the eternal fight between physicists and religious people on ""why does the universe exist""? Physicists say ""based on quantum theory, well, it just popped out from nothing, for no reason"" while religious people can't except that the whole freaking universe came to be by accident and that life looks like it's an error (since there's nowhere else, as it looks like till now of course)."
3529	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	I can't find the original source, but I recall seeing an article that said that organized religions tend to form when the population of a group exceeds one million people. This would seem to fit with the social aspect proposed here.
3530	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	i belive that religion started based on trust of outhers and somewhat practical ideas ,not with HADD. I belive that all religions had a begining in deeply personal philosophy that worked very well for some people, and poor communication skills . When others then the philosophy creators whated to lern about the ideas , they had to get the core ideas with alot of imagination and comparison so that they can undestand it, and becose they start to belive in theos new simpler anthropomorphized ideas, becose you word more to understand someting that is relatable ,without the full complex idea package, they activated the HADD and builded upon newer ideas.

3534	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	Why would those two theories (hyper agency vs. social cunstruct) work against each other? They can easily work in tandem. If the agency theory is correct, them we can assume that people are just hard wired to believe *something.* If a person experiences something they can't explain, they will take the best explanation that they can get. So if they live in a society that already has religious memes going on which perfectly explain what they witnessed, they'd be likely to just adopt that explanation. As far as the animals becoming humanoid gods thing goes, that can also be easily explained. The farther back in history we go, the more powerful and life threatening the wildlife appears to the people of that time. But with the growth of technology and civilisation, humans rose to the rip of the food chain. Ergo, humans where now the most powerful thing known to humans. So the gods became humans. Or am I missing something here?
3535	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"Well done. 1 Thought: H.A.D.D. with regards to the predators hinges on the fact that there were actual predators. The hyperactivity is caused by previous real and dangerous experiences. For it to be applied to ""seeing gods everywhere"", there must have been a real and dangerous ""god-experience"" to begin with or do they mean to say the lack of a predator then caused the believe in some other invisible ""agent"". This is then nothing more than the so-called ""god-of-the-gaps"" theory. I'd rather consult C.G.Jung (evolutionary Psychologist!!) on all of this."
3536	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	Social construct doesn't explain why people accept Religion though, it just takes it for granted that they will if other people do. I think you need something like HADD to explain the appeal.

3538	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"There is also a hardwired tendency to discern faces in a jumble of visual features, or even static. It causes us to see patterns, even though we know there is no face and no organization actually present. Look at a cloud, haven't you ever seen a bunny rabbit? This evolved in the same way as the HADD you mentioned, and is further enhanced by social pressures to see and understand expressions. The ""face"" of the Man in the Moon is a perfect example, and the Moon was often regarded as a god in early societies. So, there is the mechanism needed to go from fearing sneaky tigers and ghosts to fearing capricious gods. None of this, however, can disprove the notion that a God actually does exist, and has created a finely tuned Cosmos, designed to evolve intelligent life with religious tendencies."
3539	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	"From a believer's perspective HADD fits with the idea that there is intentionality on the part of God to be known by us. ""You have made us for yourself o God and our hearts are restless until they rest in You"" (Augustine)"

3544	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	I don't think Durkheim can really account for religion either, though. Religion is not just a communal experience; in some ways it is deeply individual. Durkheim certainly explains much of how organised religion and religious communities develop, but he doesn't have any way to account for religious Inspiration, which often flies directly in the face of organised religion. The basic intuitions that often guide religion do seem to have something more than a purely social origin.

How do they view it, whether they're religious or not in their theology, it sounds like a convincing theory? If someone believes in their religion don't they usually imply their is some physicality to their belief? Like evidence dug up or first hand accounts, all to support the idea that some spiritual supernatural thing has a sway in human lives? I suppose there is a philosophical approach too. But idk.
3547	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT8bLaomvq0	Look at ancient egypt. It seems very interesting the shift from animal gods to human gods.

Rosicrucians, Jehova’s Witnesses, Mormons, Freemasons, Gnostics, Scientologists, Wiccans and some types of Jews and pagans would be prime examples of cults that lure in members with the promise of hidden knowledge. In no way would the major Christian denominations fit the criteria of a cult. From the very beginning, Christians were outspoken about their beliefs and put them out there for the world to hear. And they all base their beliefs, almost exclusively, from the most widely available book in the world. Many denominations actually practice the doctrine of “Sola Scriptura”, or “scripture alone”, meaning that their religious beliefs are entirely based upon their understanding of the Bible. The Catholics don’t practice Sola Scriptura, but make known to the public their beliefs and practices through the Catechism, leaving nothing hidden. The apostle Paul wrote in his 2nd epistle to the Corinthians, “But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtitly, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.” In John 3:19-21 Jesus says, “And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. For everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest their deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.” These cults make hidden their “knowledge” because they are evil and do evil. The truth is very simple; Jesus Christ is the begotten Son of the only God, by whose death we are reconciled to God because He has died in our stead for our iniquities. And those who are baptized into his death, being planted together with him in death will also be raised with him in glory. There is simplicity in Christ. Believe and you will be saved.
3567	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	As a Latter-day Saint missionary, I fought my whole two year service against the perception of us as a cult. I appreciated this very academic study of why cult shouldn't be used as a term.
3568	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"The argument: ""we shouldn't use the word 'cult' in a pejorative sense"" is a strange one. For this to be sustainable you'd have to ignore the fact that language shifts over time , similar to your characterization of ""religions"" in other videos. Alternatively you would need to assert academic primacy in language use: ""only academics can use words definitively"". But in that case, ""religion"" itself should only be used by academics since (as Jonathan Z. Smith noted), ""“Religion is not a native term. It is a term invented by scholars for their intellectual purposes and is therefore theirs to define. "" Notice how often in public discourse 'religion/religious/etc. are weaponized in exactly the same way that ""cult"" can be used: to marginalize, differentiate the ""other"", and dismiss. Just read some of the comments in your videos or listen to Bill Maher. Words have a general use and specific, in-group use. It's in everyone's interest to maintain linguistic continuity (to promote society-wide communication), even while acknowledging the continual evolution of language. In-group specialized usage of words goes far in preserving language meaning since the group population is smaller than the general population. For this reason, calling another group ""cult"" within a specific group likely carries specific meaning for that group and playing the ""academic definition"" card has no salutary effect. It's meaningful to understand the semantic range of a word, including academic usage, but attempts at linguistic policing are misguided when herding cats is easier than herding word use. Unless there is thought-control of Orwellian proportions, the wisest course is to seek to be understood and to understand the individuals we are in communication with at any given moment."
3569	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	You just completely forgot B.I.T.E didn't you?
3570	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"When I think of the word ""cult"", I think of it in broadly two senses. 1. A religion that is so lacking in transparency that you have to join the religion and/or materially contribute to the religion simply to find out what the religions doctrines and practices even are (for example Scientology). 2. A religion that lacks the institutional structure (such as sacred texts, councils, leadership succession rules etc.) necessary for it to survive the religions founders death, making its existence purely to feed the founders ego (for example the Peoples Temple). When discussing this with someone way back, they summarized this thinking as this ""When some says, 'Worship me!', you have a cult. When someone says, 'Worship some invisible dude in the sky!' you have a religion."""

3572	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	You say that by labeling a modern religion a cult we are simply being biased and disparaging a religion we dislike, and also that by doing so we are stooping to a layman conversation. But to even make that claim you have to completely ignore the psychological studies of cult behavior and manipulation. You’re setting this up as a dichotomy between historians and laymen and completely ignoring other academic fields and how they use the term.
3573	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Have you looked into the bite model though?
3574	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	How so you feel about the BITE model and other methods to quantify the difference between a cult and a religion. The BITE model doesn't focus on size or whether the doctrine is wacky but on how the group treats its members. How strictly do they control behavior, how strictly do they control information both outside information and information about the religion. If they force you to even perpetually think a certain way, or teach techniques to suppress your emotions. Under that metric Mormon and the Amish would still count as cults but to different degrees while your neighborhood Methodist church wouldn't and it's less about wackiness than how the organization relates to its members and the outside world.
3575	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"You lost me when you said ""who refers to the Amish in Hasidic Jews as a cult ,no one"" they are a cult tho"

3578	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	All religions are absolutely cults, that is just a fact.
3579	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"I think you should clarify that the word cult has multiple uses. There is the use you have for religious studies, but sociologically, there is such a thing as a cult. It isn't about what they teach (every religion looks weird to outsiders - for example, role playing eating human flesh and drinking blood is pretty freaking weird, but most Christians do it and don't think twice about it), but about the way they use intense indoctrination, manipulate their members' time, demand their money, and separate the members from the rest of society. Cults exist outside of religion as well. There are financial cults (typically manifesting themselves as MLMs) and political cults (which are more rare and more complicated). I agree completely that it isn't a useful term in your line of study, but ""cult"" is a word that does have a purpose. It shouldn't be used to criticize people for believing differently, but it should be used as a warning about religions that take advantage of their members in ways that often have disastrous results."
3580	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"Personally,I'd like to see more research from the psychology world on the damaging psychological effects of highly authoritarian religions (which is what I would classify as a ""cult"") Age of a religion matters far less to me than how a religion effects society and its followers when it comes to labeling it with a word of negative connotation."

3583	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	All religion is cultism. I don't care how how you explain it. No religion, I like the idea, the people in them. It's fairy tales... I just can't lol

3585	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	I'm an atheist, so I honestly see religion and cult as being interchangeable. Religion just seems to be a more conventionally accepted cult.

3589	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"This doesn't really cover the fact that it can be useful in other contexts. Cult study is an actual thing; they don't tend to care about the specific ideology of ""new religious orders"" and in fact don't have to even be religious or spiritual. It's about the specific tactics that groups use to pressure and abuse their members and recruit new ones. Calling them religious orders misses the point, because it's not necessarily a judgement on the ideology - most wouldn't call Christianity as a whole a cult, but isolated Christian ""communities"" which definitely do count. Likewise behaviours exist in other extremist communities like white nationalist groups, with similar rules popping up time and time again. Is it useful in religious studies (outside of specific proper nouns like the Cult of Mithras)? No. Is it a completely invalid slur in every field of study? It's contested."
3590	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Ok! So, religion presumably constitutes a widely accepted body of theological beliefs whereas the word cult is a pejorative term. I've always thought that a cult is a group of folks whose beliefs and practices deviate from those of established popular religions.
3591	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Some cults focus almost exclusively on one character/person/deity. I consider those to be different than off-Christian cults such as Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, etc., who focus on one part of the Bible and distort its meaning to alter the practices of the group. In these cases, there is often massive psychological pressure to stay within the group. I understand that I have biased my response by deeming these groups to be cults from the get-go, but that is deliberate. Please note that I am not using the term in a derogatory fashion; it is just an apt term for the group and its practices.
3592	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	As a Christian, I hate to say this, but I'm pretty sure Billy and Franklin Graham removing Mormonism from the Christian's list of cults was more of a political move than a religious move :(

3595	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Look at the BITE model to define a cult. Behaviour control Information control Thought control Emotional control Mormons, Jehovah Witnesses, Scientologists to name a few all are cults from this perspective, doesn't matter how big and accepted an organization becomes.
3596	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Mormonism *IS* a cult. It is fully based on lies, racism and a delusional founder. And I believe the only reason they started letting Black folks in is because of social pressure. Basically nothing will change my mind on this. I wonder if the rumor that they have every American citizen's birth certificate (Mormon or not) in a vault somewhere is true though?
3597	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"""why dont we count the armish or harshitic (spelling) jews as cults?"" oh but i do"
3598	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Just to let you know, sometimes the word cult is used within the Mormon community as a tool of communal introspection, accountability, and activism. Imagine a group of fully believing, semi-believing, formerly believing, and never-mormons sitting in a room or online activism group admittibg that yes, they are a cult, but they can do something about it. It happens all the time. There is a can-do attitude among Mormons. They haven't lost that will to take terms that used to be considered derogatory, and use them for ingenious reworkings of group improvement and identity. So, it's used to organize conferences, volunteer services, and other efforts aimed at studying and advocating for solutions to problems within the community. Don't worry about calling us a cult. While some Mormons are still resistent to that term, a growing number are finding practical utility in it and other associated terms and sayings.
3599	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	I like Ravi Zacharias definition of a cult at least in reference to Christianity. (Don’t quote me on this as I am making a rough reference from memory, look it up if you want to hear his actual words and not my interpretation). Basically a cult is a group that moves away from traditional teachings by adding their own content etc and is generally led by an individual. Hopefully you get the point that it would loop in groups like Mormons as they took Christianity and added to it based on only one mans revelation and absolutely nothing else. Not so much as a single town mentioned in the Book of Mormon can be found in America. That being said if it causes them discrimination maybe move away from it but as a Christian I can’t legitimise it in the same way I could for example legitimise Islam because at least it’s based in actual locations with real life people
3600	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"I've seen ""cult"" used to describe any kind of group, religious or otherwise, with a leanings towards fanaticism, ""us vs. them"" mentality, worship of a charismatic leader, suppression of criticisism, etc, etc. I mean, what other word would you use to describe dangerous groups, that brainwash people - either to scam them or out of genuine delusions? I think ""Cult"" might mean different things, depending on the context."

3605	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Difference between a religion and a cult is in a religion the guy that is being devoted to is dead already.
3606	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"The definition of ""the difference between a cult and a religion"" i always came across is: a cult doesn't invite/tolerate criticism of their practices/beliefs, often with a single personage as their leader/prophet/guru."
3607	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"You seem to be unaware of the work of Dr. Robert Jay Lifton or of Steven Hassan of the Freedom of Mind resource center. Not all Cults are religious groups but SOME religious groups ARE Cults. There can also be purely political cults, like the SLA or The LaRouche Movement, or commercial cults like Amway, or religious cults like The Branch Davidians. What defines a Cult, academically, is whether or not the group uses techniques of Undue Influence on it's followers. Does the authoritarian leader or guru utilize and encourage mind control, brainwashing techniques, social alienation, parental estrangement, unethical hypnosis, physical and mental abuse, human trafficking, violent extremism, terrorism, & other forms of undue influence in accordance with the B.I.T.E. model? (BITE is Behavior control, Information control, Thought control, Emotional control.) If so, the group is NOT an established religion, political group, or commercial enterprise like The Catholic Church, The Democratic Party, or Walmart. And if they are a legitimate ""New Religious Movement"" that does NOT employ the BITE model, then by all means, don't call it a cult. BUT, if they are like The Manson Family committing mass murders, or Heaven's Gate committing mass suicide, or Al-Qaeda flying planes into buildings, or Aum Shinrikyo planting poison gas on the Tokyo subways, or the Rajneeshees spraying salmonella on restaurant salad bars, or Scientology making you pay them all of your money to them to hook you up to an E-Meter to get rid of your ""reactive mind"" by claiming they are removing your ""body thetans;"" then they ARE a cult! It's because they are using undue influence to perpetrate a deceptive scheme. The scheme is, to get you to not only surrender your money, your time, and your social life to them, but your entire free will. Legitimate religions don't demand that you surrender your free will and engage in totally submissive group-think. CULTS do that."
3608	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"Scientology seems to be insidious in ways perhaps distinct from other ""new religious movements"". If ""cult"" is not a good term, is there any better label for harmful or dangerous religious groups like scientology or the Jamestown people?"
3609	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"I think the major problem is that people today see that the word ""cult"" as an entirely negative word, instead of seeing it under the original neutral meaning like you described. So when Christian theological scholars consider sects like Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Scientology as cults, they mean it under the degree of ""This group differs in fundamental beliefs under the guise of our religion. We do not recognize them as our own, therefore they are admonished as a cult so that they are not to be confused as one of us."" but people think that they are being exiled or rejected instead of simply being split from the progenitor group, and begin to see the word as a negative label instead of an academic and scholarly definition. It's sad because I've had a lot of Mormon friends get mad at me for saying something like this, but as much as they don't like it, it's still true. However I don't know if ""New Religious Movement"" would work in a situation like this, since they are not considered all that new in the current time frame, and that Mormons still consider themselves under the Christian doctrine when they officially aren't by literally every other Christian denomination."
3610	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	I agree with the assessment that “cult” is merely, colloquially, a pejorative for the term “religion”.....but isn’t predicating something as “academic” merely a euphemism for an invalid inference to authority? It really shouldn’t matter if the use of a term is “academic” or not. All that matters is whether or not there is some manner in which the use of that term is accurate.
3611	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	A religion is a highly successful and long lasting cult.

3613	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	The way I've always used it is to refer to a relatively new religious belief system that has not stemmed directly from a longer standing one. In my view Scientology is a cult. The things they believe are all based on the works of a fiction writer. Their ideas and concepts don't attempt to tie themselves back into older religions for legitimacy. Whereas I see something like Mormonism as more of a sect. They believe in a christian god, Jesus, angles and such. They uphold the bible as a venerated text. They just wanted to incorporate the new world into old religion. They remixed as apposed to making something new. But at the same time they aren't time tested enough in my view to be considered a denomination of Christianity.

3620	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Excellent video! Great to know and understand that ALL religions can be considered a cult. People who call a religion a cult are simply bigots and simple-minded as we have seen, so many times. I would argue that some companies, sports teams and other secular organizations, are cults/religions as people their followers have a religious fervor about their organization's objectives, products, beliefs, etc. Many soccer games erupt into mass hysteria and murder with fans/followers adamant to defend their team and beliefs.
3621	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	I’m a Mormon and I’ve heard from many that I’m part of a cult. I’m glad you used us as an example of how cult as a term is often misused.
3622	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Nope, downvote. Cults are cults.
3623	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"I think you only considered this from the religious study perspective, but you're missing the linguistic/sociological piece of the puzzle. Using the word ""cult"" facilitates communication just like we call bad killing ""murder"", delicious food ""gourmet"". People needs the right to express dissenting voice, and removing the tool for doing so would be Orwellian in its literal sense. I get it when you say the word ""cult"" has been used as a tool of oppression. For that I want to say, it is not worth it to throw out the proverbial baby with the bathwater -- Surely you'd agree religion can be both a tool for oppression and liberation and disagree banning religion from existing because it can be used as a tool for oppression. And I recognize that there is a problem with people discriminating against minority religion's members, I just think the cure to have nuanced conversations. It's not whether to use the word ""cult"", but whether the conversation stops at the word ""cult"". As an atheist, I'm more than happy to attest that Jehovah's witnesses resisted nazi rules in Germany during the war. Good job doing that. On the other hand, my friend (who had a friend in the religion) wouldn't even listen to me despite she admittedly does not know why people don't like them(like, all I'm asking was, ""do you know what reasons might others give for not liking this religion"", not even whether she agrees with those reasons or not). When you don't know the reason, of course it feels like bigotry."
3624	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Scientology is a cult.
3625	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Interestingly, in swedish, 'kult' is alot closer to the older meaning of the word. This is while 'sekt', wich just means religious group in english, refers to a small and to the followers usuly physicaly and/or psycologicaly destructive religious group, ruled over by a charismatic leader. In the latter case, it does not even have to be a separate religion or bransh of such, as can be seen in the case with the Knutby-sekt, wich was part of the large Pentecostal church.
3626	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Perfect way to define Religion vs Cult. All religions are basically very big cults. When is a cult big enough to be called a religion? When it has at least one long term (min a decade old) co-active schism. i.e. when a cult is grown up enough to have baby cults it is a religion.
3627	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	so the term cult is used generally to mean a belief system that employs severe psychological pressure to join and remain. and from viewing Mormonism somewhat close yes it is a cult
3628	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"I came across this other YT video on this question: https://youtu.be/anebC42tuvM Not quite as academic a presentation as yours, he does not shy away from labeling something a ""cult"", but still interesting. Conclusion there is a rather simple distinction: if the organization continues after the leader is dead = religion. If the organization fizzles out after the leader's death = cult. Though what that does mean is that while the founder of a new religion is alive, it is not yet possible to determine if one is dealing with a cult or a religion. By such a standard, before Jesus' death, his movement would have been considered a cult. In fact, if the Jesus and his followers were transported into our time, we might very well see the media calling it a ""cult""."
3629	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"Nice one! I really appreciate the example of the Amish as a group that no one would derisively call a cult, but fits a lot of the categories that are often pointed at.You mention ""cult of saints'""I JUST ordered that from the library, and was thinking if goin to pick it up from the bookstore today."
3630	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	love this video. i feel like a lot of Christians dont realize that jesus was a bit of a cult leader in his days.
3631	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	... so in synopsis I can use the word cult because I once did when I said the cult of Mithra but nobody else can use it in any way without being ignorant. This message brought to you by Solipsists International. Thank you for your time.
3632	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"Mormonism is the perfect example of cult vs religion. I grew up in the church but no longer practice or believe. While I disagree with the church's teachings and feel like certain practices and policies are harmful, I do get a little offended when random people who know nothing about Mormonism call it a cult. However, I feel that all religions lie on a spectrum of ""cultiness"" and that religion needs to pass a certain threshold for me to consider it a true cult (while realizing that calling a religious group a cult is not helpful in any way). But looking back at church history when Joseph Smith first founded the religion, I definitely would have considered it a cult much like some of the weird hippy communes that seem to worship their leader who tends to take advantage of their authority within their group. If I heard that some dude who grew up on a farm said he found some buried treasure that only he was allowed to see, and that he's a prophet who talks to God, and all his followers need to give up all their possessions in a communistic manner, all while marrying multiple women, some of them already married to other men and one as young as 14, I'd definitely consider that a cult. But today, the mainstream church has adapted to societal changes to the point where they're basically just protestants who believe that everyone goes to heaven when you die and some of them get to make their own planets. Oh and no coffee. So to me, the church went from decently culty to only slightly above average cultiness. But again, this is all relative."
3633	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	But what about the new religious movements with charismatic messianic leaders who exploit their followers through their perceived holiness for their own personal gain and power? Are all new religious movements like this? Could we separate new religious movements that do not exploit their followers for the personal gain of the one charismatic leader from those that do?
3634	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Nonsense - a cult has charismatic leadership, indoctrination and exploitation. all religions are cults, the differences are just a matter of size

Also, you could call any orthodox, and definitely all ultra orthodox Jews a cult under the first definition since orthodox Judaism is essentially strict rules about every aspect of daily life, same with Islam. In that regard, Christianity is the outlier of the major monotheistic religions with it's very lax regard to rules like this (due to the urge to make it as non Jewish as possible from the start) and possibly the fact that in Western society ""neutral"" religion is Christianity, even if you are non-practicing."
3637	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"Excellent! love it! Perfect for my teaching purposes. I will be sure to add this to my own course resources for my students. Point seems to be to not use the term ""cult"" in the negative context that the media tends to use it. such use confuses and misleads the common man when they then hear academics use the term in the academic context. Just one question, what sort of term would you use for groups like Jim Jones' People's Temple (""bad religion"")? Or Charles manson's ""The Family""?"
3638	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"A good example of this is how some people (especially the Chinese Communist Party) always refer to Falun Gong as an ""evil cult""."
3639	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	When a new religious movement venerates its founder as their Apostle, and the founder is running a huge, fraudulent financial scheme unbeknownst to the followers, with them providing the money, willingly, what is the academic term for that? Fortunately, it has been defunct for a long time now, and though it caused me a lot of trouble I also learned a great deal of positive value from the experience. I enjoyed and appreciated your video -- thanks!
3640	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"Interesting to learn that the term is more neutral in historical use. Colloquially, I guess I tend to use ""cult"" for anything that appears (from my end) to use spiritual concepts to scam people for money, power, social control, or sexual exploitation. But that's obviously not a definition that would fly in an academic environment. :)"
3641	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"Esoteric orders such as the freemasons and the rosacrucians are often called ""cults"" due to their secretive nature. How would you define these groups and others alike? Also, many esoteric orders exist within religions while, at the same time, offering a distinct interpretation of the official dogmas of the religions they are related to such as sufism, what do you make up of these groups? On another topic, could you talk about the differences between universal religions and the tribal ones? I do not know if the terms ""universal"" and ""tribal"" are corret, but it seems clear to me that some religions are closely associated with ethnicity or race while others make no distinction between ethnical background."
3642	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Excellent video, but I must say, although it defies your definition, in my experience A cult usually has a secret that you must be deeply initiated before it can be known, and you can't leave. A religion usually tells the secret somewhere in the beginning, and u can walk away if it doesn't work for you (even if you are shunned)
3643	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	"Maybe cult is inappropriate in an academic sense. However, I don't think I will adopt a blanket omission of the term with on the ground use, as it is still appropriate to use in non-neutral settings. On a related note, established religions like Christianity started out with strong apocalyptic undertones. Even the Lutheran movement within Christianity started out with its own strong apocalyptic overtones--and yet today is not generally seen as a cult. I will say apocalyptic elements have never left Christianity or Lutheranism even though many today perceive these as ""ordinary"" religions."
3644	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Brainwash is just education by information or misinformation and then believed whole heartedly.
3645	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	Your videos inspired me to go into Religious Studies
3646	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	if I understood: people tend to mean religion as being normal to society while cult means extremist, radical, far-fetched to the norm considered by society. Also would you talk about the role of early female christians?
3647	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc	This channel is a great resource on religion. I have learned a lot from it. The word cult, has changed a lot in history. Today, the word cult in the lost its real meaning, to become something it isn't.
3648	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUn6jtn4NE	I look forward to Laura’s recipe but find a bit daunting getting through all the chatter. Find myself trying to fast forward through the video to get to the import parts…and to the point.
3649	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUn6jtn4NE	Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
3650	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUn6jtn4NE	Laura..this is Mom's food! So cozy and close to the heart..Well appreciated (and prepared) here in Brazil...
3651	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUn6jtn4NE	Looks marvellous. We call cilantro coriander here in Australia. Ciao.
3652	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUn6jtn4NE	"Great technique in pre-browning. I've learned that the objective of the sear is to induce the ""mailliard"" reaction and not for ""sealing in the juices. Also, once the vegetables have browned, wouldn't it be OK to de-galze with a little wine? That way, the bits from browning the meat will be dissolved. As a last alternative, braising in the oven can avoid the need to intermittently stir. As an alternative to rice, some Orzo pasta is a good idea Thanks!"
3653	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUn6jtn4NE	My favorite Cuban dish. First thing I eat when in Weh Pam Beash, FL.
3654	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUn6jtn4NE	Jesus loves you Laura 😊. He wants you to give Him all of you. He wants you to serve Him. He wants to show you how much he loves you and has loved you. Be blessed by these words.
3655	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUn6jtn4NE	My mouth was watering watching this one. I will absolutely make it this week! Thank you so much! You are amazing.
3656	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUn6jtn4NE	Another word for “Ropa Vieja” is “Carne Ripiá” [Cuban here]. Also; very common mistake is to make it too tomatoe-y and with not enough punch. I’m optimistic this one is good! 👍🏼
3657	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	Non è Amatriciana ma pasta pomodoro e pancetta che è anche più buona☺️ Ottima esecuzione.
3658	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	Oh my gosh I Love this. I’m especially excited that you are paying homage to your homeland. Wonderful vid, your redo’s take me back to our beginning with you. Keep going ! ❤️🇨🇦
3659	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	It's hard to find pancetta and guanciale where I live unless I want to drive over an hour, so I often use salami for this dish.
3660	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	I’m so happy to see you posted today❤️ been having a low energy day, just not feeling well but your videos make me feel so much better.

3662	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	When was the last time you updated your Spaghetti Aglio e Olio recipe? I mean, I imagine it's still the same, but seeing an updated video might be fun :)
3663	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	she just showed us how to make spaghetti.
3664	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	Hi Laura….what a beautiful dish, 👏👏 and yes “bucatini “ pasta is hard to find but I will search high and low to make this. I would LOVE ❤️ to see your take on spaghetti with fresh clams (in white sauce)!!😁😁 Be safe, Be well ✌️✌️🥰🥰
3665	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	Hi Laura! Please can you do an updated Carbonara recipe? ❤️Love from Barcelona
3666	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	I think you’re probably being very modest, that pasta looks like it’s a 1000000/10! 😋🤤
3667	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	So funny, I always have pecorino because it’s what I prefer so I end up subbing it for parm in recipes. They are both so good I feel you can’t go wrong either way!! 😋
3668	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	07:14 She'll call the pasta police on you. 😂
3669	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	ok laura or whoever wants to answer this..... to me this is a dble edged sword...... she tells you that oil..... will coat the pasta so the sauce WONT get absorbed into the pasta....BUT.... WHATS IN THE SAUCE??????????? OLIVE OIL AND GREASE... sooooo how can the tomatoe sauce and seasonings get absorbed into the pasta????? GREAT RECIEPE ANS EASY BUT IT CONTRIDES ITS SELF...can someone break this down??????????
3670	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	Finally getting back to Italy in September. I can’t wait to get back to the great food. I love how the pasta comes in a perfect twirly pile that I just can’t recreate.
3671	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	I had a request! Can papa Sal teach us how to prep/can tomatoes? I am growing san matízano tomatoes this year to make amazing sauces From scratch ❤️
3672	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	Pasta cacio e peppe, please :-)
3673	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	The 🍝 emoji KILLS me cause it shows the sauce on top of plain pasta!!
3674	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	Wow. This looks amazing. I am craving something like that right now. I'm going to make it today. I just have one question. Do you think it would be good if I added some chopped green pepper?
3675	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	Good Lord, lady. You're the bomb! 💥
3676	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	laughing 🤣 at some of amazing Laura's expressions! I AGREE 👍 KEEP IT ITALIAN!

3684	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	I need to make this ASAP! Looks absolutely delicious! ☺️
3685	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	If I was making this myself I’d focus on ensuring the quality of the very few ingredients are top notch. Would you agree??
3686	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	I have made your original recipe for years - it’s a staple in our house! So glad to see this again!

3689	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLkcS-YhY0U	Thank you so much for sharing this delicious Italian dishes. I have been watching you for so many years and your videos are so fun and entertaining. I made your meat sauce a while back and it was awesome. I am not Italian, but I love Italian food and I absolutely love your channel. You are an amazing cook! ❤️
3690	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	I’m going to attempt to make this on St. Patrick’s Day and I just want to know how many hours to cook on low? 2-3?
3691	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	What is westash souse?
3692	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	All I’m looking for are the potatoes and this would be my type of stew!! Seriously all your recipes are perfection
3693	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	A great recipe just in time for our St. Patrick’s Day 🍀 Irish Guinness Beef Stew💚
3694	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	I love you, and have been watching your videos since you had about 100,000 subs. But you ruined Beef Stew with this recipe. Never discard baron grease for olive oil.
3695	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	Goodness gracious! That's just great for beef stew! Thanks again, Laura! I think I can handle it!
3696	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	This dish is so thick and full of flavors. After a long reduction in the broth, the meat can not help but become tender. So yummy!
3697	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	Salt and pepa here 😆
3698	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	Throwing away bacon fat is almost sacrilegious😳😳😳😳 you can save it and use it for so many other things, like frying eggs or just adding a teaspoon in your soup and many more . This is one of my favorite meals, my daughter is the Guiness stew cook in my house , she has really perfected it🥰 Maybe I’ll ask her to make it for my birthday on the 28th😂 Her birthday is the 26th, so if I make her Favorit meal maybe she’ll make mine😄
3699	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	I am surprised that there's no potatoes??
3700	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8HuSkD0Nms	Looks great but u did nit show how to make gravy part

3704	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	I had no idea this dish had a name! I make it with plain yogurt instead of cream and spinach instead of kale because I live on the Balkans and yogurt and spinach are easier to find. It works!
3705	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	That looks delicious! In the Netherlands we call this Boerenkool!! We eat it with sausage and bacon!! Blessings from the Netherlands 🇳🇱 🙏🏾
3706	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	I’ve never heard of this dish but you had me at potato. Looks yummy 😋
3707	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	Hey Laura, I'm from Ireland as well, there's not really a traditional Paddy's day dish but in our house it's usually a lamb or beef stew, with a good healthy portion of spuds
3708	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	In the Netherlands we boile the cale with the patatos. And then put some baked bacon and sausage in it. Some even use some vinegar with it.
3709	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	"I thought I was the only one who added scallions galore to my colcannon. (galore is a word of Irish origin, btw!) I think the classic green is cabbage, however ... the ""col"" of colcannon is like the 'cole' of coleslaw - cabbage! Yours looks great, too!"
3710	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	You need to use Irish butter .. knob of Kerrygold … yummy
3711	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	Irish grandmother. Cabbage and scallions, lots of butter. Never tried kale. Looks great not made in years, bring back memories. She died 1984.
3712	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	Bangers and mash is a very British dish…..not Irish
3713	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	Yes we do have corned beef and cabbage here in Ireland but not just on Paddy's day. Any cabbage will do, and yes you want a dry spud to help your mash be fluffier. It's a bank holiday here and most towns and cities have a parade (apart from the last two years ) then we spend time with friends and family.
3714	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	We always use cabbage and for sure the Yukon holds!
3715	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	With a possibility of WW3, you should start making some poor man meal recipes
3716	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	Hey Laura i live in Ireland ...years ago when my Nan made Calcannon she would mix young nettles in with the greens to stretch the veg and the spuds, for her very large family ....it was not talked about it was just done that way.....people would snear at families who ate nettles .......now all this time later the benefits of nettles are revered ....so my Nan was right :) love the video xx
3717	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-wE-fb_w68	Is the burner even on those potatoes? I can’t think about anything else. I’ll have to rewatch this after I get visual confirmation they’ve boiled. 😅

3724	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWycD2yd0zE	Ma'am, this is a nice recipe, I'm Irish & if you want these to really taste good fry them in bacon fat, then they will be perfect & that also works for for fried cornbread batter if you have never tried fried cornbread
3725	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWycD2yd0zE	Was the shredded potato cooked or not ?
3726	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWycD2yd0zE	Looks like a great breakfast dish for St. Patrick's Day morning with bangers ! Thank you for this recipe🍀
3727	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWycD2yd0zE	☘️ 💚🍀”Top of the afternoon ta ya”; with our St. Patty’s Day just around the corner, this is a great version of the famous ☘️Irish Potato pancakes; Irish or Not?

3732	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	This was posted in my birthday !
3733	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I just made these and they were amazing I can't put it in words. Some changes that I made was add another tablespoon of shortening and a tablespoon of butter less. I also noticed that they were a little bit too sweet for me but they were still amazing!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!!!
3734	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Just put these in the oven, dough came out fantastic - texture and taste wise. NOTES AND/OR TIPS: I didn't have any unsalted butter on hand, so I just added salted butter and didn't add the extra tsp of salt. I don't have a stand mixer, I used the whisks for a hand mixer to cream the butter and sugars + the eggs and vanilla, and then folded in the dry ingredients with a spatula. I added twice as much cinnamon I also used two sticks of butter instead of 1 1/2 of butter and 1/2 stick of shortening, I didn't have any shortening on hand.
3735	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	could I use baking powder instead off the baking soda?
3736	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	why is it my cookies dont go flat they are mounds
3737	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	How much butter and shortening do we need?
3738	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	my cookies became soggy ? why did that happen :(
3739	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Who's watching this in 2016
3740	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Laura do I have to have that mixer or a hand mixer is ok also?
3741	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Is the Vegetable Shortening optional or it has to be in the recipe?
3742	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	If I don't want to use vegetable shortening do I replace it with butter or do I just leave it out completely
3743	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	What is I want to make just a dozen? What do I do?
3744	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	made this yesterday and I love it. Thanks Laura for the great recipe.
3745	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Hallelujah, it worked!!!! The perfect thin, crispy on the edge, chewy in the middle chocolate chip cookie!!!! Thank you!!!
3746	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Ingredients: 2 ¼ cups All Purpose Flour 1 tsp Salt 1 tsp Baking Soda 1/8 tsp Ground Cinnamon 2 Eggs 1 tsp Vanilla Extract 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp of Unsalted Room Temperature Butter 2 tbsp Vegetable Shortening at Room Temperature ¾ cup of Granulated Sugar ¾ of a Cup of Brown Sugar 2 cups Semisweet Chocolate Chips Process, 1) Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. 2) Combine together the first 4 ingredients and set aside. 3) In a mixer bowl fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter, shortening, and both sugars. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix together until all creamy and combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is mixed well. 4) Add the dry ingredients and mix just to combine. Add the chocolate chips and mix just to distribute them through the batter. 5) Using a small ice cream scoop, drop the cookie dough 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until lightly golden brown around the edges. 6) Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet then remove onto wire rack and cool completely. These are not your typical doughy and dense cookies. These are light, crisp yet soft, chewy and incredibly chocolaty. The cinnamon is not strong enough to detect right away it just makes the chocolate more intense. I promise that once you make these cookies, you will never stop making them because they are seriously addicting. Enjoy!Recipe By: Laura Vitale
3747	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I made a few changes and they turned out perfect. First of all, I halved the recipe (I only wanted 2 dozen) and I put one more tablespoon of butter and cut out two tablespoons of the flower. I also slightly flattened the cookies when I scooped the dough onto the pan. They turned out to be soft in the middle, crisp around the edges, and thin. I hope this helped :)
3748	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	How do I get them to be flat? Mine always turn out fluffy
3749	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I don't have shortening? Helpp please lol
3750	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	What can i use instead of the vegetable shortening?
3751	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	What does she said along with butter I didn't get that can someone say to me
3752	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Can you use plain and self raising flour instead if all purpose?
3753	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Laura I tried these cookies and they were good, but mine came out cakey.... what do you think I did wrong?

3759	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I'll bet she doesn't eat much of what she cooks as its lots of fat and u can get fat she avoids these I am sure and sticks to salads. Everyone else gets fat making it and eating it while she doesn't I'm sure lol
3760	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Okay first time I made this, it came out perfect. 2nd time I made this, it went flat and my dough is kinda wet? I followed everything though except for shortening.
3761	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Was so disappointed with this recipe, I followed the recipe to the T and it did not look anything like her cookies! It was super dry and not chewy, it wasn't thin like hers mines turned out fat. Super disappointed

3763	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I have tried to make these twice. I've been having an issue. The first issue is that i tried to cook 2 trays in the oven, but it seem to not cook evenly. So i bought some cooking pans and the other issue is that the cookies keeps burning the edges of the cookies.The cookies does not cook evenly for some reason. I'm no sure if i should cook these with one tray at a time OR go an buy better cooking sheets. I think the ones i have seem to warp slightly. HELP Any body have any recommendations?

3782	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	did Laura uses 1 stick of butter?... and 1 stick of butter from US is equal to 1/2 cup and not 3/4 cup as stated in the recipe.... wait I'm confused lol. I've baked this before using her recipe but it didn't come out as spread as Laura's cookie tho. Um... should I add a bit more butter to it???
3783	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	In the recipe you said 10-12 minutes, in the video you said 8-10. How much do I do it for? Also I noticed you didn't flatten them at all, am I not as pose to, do they really spread that much without flattening the balls at all?
3784	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Should I use Laura's or Joy of Baking's cookie recipe?? Pls reply quick w/ an honest answer. (PS: im not trying to offend either one of the best YouTube chefs/baker)
3785	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	can i omit the brown sugar n use regular sugar instead ?
3786	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	for some reason mine always comes a bit dry. it is always soft but the dough just seems dry. any ideas how to fix?
3787	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	If you couldn't find the recipe here it is ... Chocolate chip cookies Ingredients: 2 ¼ cups All Purpose Flour 1 tsp Salt 1 tsp Baking Soda 1/8 tsp Ground Cinnamon 2 Eggs 1 tsp Vanilla Extract 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp of Unsalted Room Temperature Butter 2 tbsp Vegetable Shortening at Room Temperature ¾ cup of Granulated Sugar ¾ of a Cup of Brown Sugar 2 cups Semisweet Chocolate Chips 1) Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. 2) Combine together the first 4 ingredients and set aside. 3) In a mixer bowl fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter, shortening, and both sugars.

3788	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Urm I have a question that do we have to use vegetable shortening please anyone answer asap I really wanna make these cookies so badly
3789	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Best cookies ever! I baked a dozen and they dissapeared so fast. Thanks for this recipe. I can't wait to keep cooking with your recipes.
3790	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Hello can anyone answer this please and thank you (:? Do you need to have a mixer? Or can you use like a wooden spoon or a spatula?
3791	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Hey Laura, I made 100 of these cookies for a charity event and they sold out in 2 hours! People said they were delicious! Thank you very much xx
3792	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I know this is weird and irrelevant but i dont like the way she talk but i dont know why
3793	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Perfect go-to recipe. I halved the ingredients, baked a small batch (6) and froze the remaining dough. Cookies on demand is a great thing!
3794	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	can u use baking powder instead of baking soda
3795	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	If I cut the recipe in half, would I need to change the temperature or the baking time?
3796	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I tried making these cookies! I failed!! completely! I have no idea what I did wrong. I'm not very satisfied within myself.
3797	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Is is ok to make the dough one week earlier and freeze them?? Will it taste as good??
3798	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	"Just made a Batch---my first ""from scratch"" cookies in my life and I'm 64 years old..They turned out perfect and were super easy to do....."
3799	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Do you have a conversion for making a smaller batch. This is a great recipe, but I can't make these many cookies. I'm looking to make 12-20 cookies maybe.
3800	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	What are cups in grammes and whats is Fahrenheit in Celcius????? Ik want to make this so badly but I don't know how to measure
3801	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Do we have to just leave them in the oven and they will become flat by themselves? Plz answer ASAP...
3802	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	instead of saying 4 dozens you could of said 48 also known as 12 times 4 equals to 48

3805	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	can i use cane sugar instead of brown sugar?
3806	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	How much butter?? you did not say
3807	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	3:38 that's what she said! winning! lol. those cookies do look good though.
3808	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I don't know what I did wrong. Mine came out thick and chewy :(
3809	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I forgot to ask...How do you keep the cookies from getting hard??? Mines came out pretty, soft and prefect but the cookies started getting a little hard. How do I prevent this???
3810	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	How much butter and shortening does she put it?
3811	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Can I use a whisk? Cause I don't have an electric mixer
3812	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	cinnamon too, do I need a pepper as well
3813	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	don't have vegetable shortening?? and what do I use b/c I don't have baking soda, but have baking powder?
3814	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Omg I made these cookies tonight, they were incredible! Unfortunately, my vegetable shortening went bad so I had to leave it out, but I will add it next time. I will never buy Tollhouse again!
3815	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Is there an alternative for vegetable shortening
3816	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	Do I have to add the vegetable shortening or is it optional ?
3817	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	I made this and I wasn't a fan! I love your recipes, but my mom seriously makes the best cookies ever and her CC cookies are so chocolatey and soft and melt in your mouth. These didn't compare at all. But, that always happens with baking and mothers lol ;)
3818	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	i though it was to saltey even my ferends
3819	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	i made this cookies and it was soo much fun and they come out delicious :) thankyou !

3824	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuL_OLWMd_U	For all of us, who don't use cups and that strange stuff: 200g Butter, 26g shortening, 170g sugar, 150g brown sugar, 2 eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 280g flour, 1tsp salt, 1tsp baking soda, 1/5 tsp cinammon, 365g chocolate. (190°C) They came out WONDERFUL. You really need to watch them so you take them out as soon as they start to get color on the sides and then they're just amazing.
3825	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	Chef out of water?? When are going to continue that 😕 😪
3826	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	These look really good. I will definitely give them a try. The absolute best brownie I ever had was many years ago and they were Bob's Big Boy brownies. I've tried many recipes and no one has ever come close. It's a shame too. Anyways, I like your recipe a lot. Thank you♥
3827	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	I'm super happy to see Alexis again. Hopefully she does more with Tasty. Chef out of water is one of the best out there
3828	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	Semisweet chocolate 170g Butter 114g Sugar 300g Flour 120g Vanilla extract is about 10 ml Salt ....a pinch 4 eggs large Bake at 350(180°C) for 25 minutes
3829	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	I like that this recipe is pretty basic so theyre easy to make but staples like cocoa powder, espresso powder and chocolate chunks would’ve elevated these brownies
3830	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	She said “fudgy” thrice, but they look cakey in every shot.
3831	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	Do happy to see Alexis again, haven't seen her in a while
3832	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	You didn't put baking powder/baking soda in the flour.
3833	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	Wonderful recipe 😍 but can you write ingredients in grams?) for russian followers 🥺
3834	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	These look wonderful, definitely trying this out! 😋
3835	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	I cannot believe I have an exam tomorrow and I'm here........... seeing how brownies are made
3836	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAtvknk2xrQ	First?
3837	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Growing up in Calcasieu Parish, with family on the Gulf in Cameron Parish, we would do seafood gumbo mainly. We’d even pop oysters in it right before serving. SO GOOD! My grandmother would put the filet in the rough. Makes a difference!
3838	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Why is this not a mainstream dish ?! I absolutely loved the recipe
3839	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Thank you for sharing your recipe with us 🙏🏻
3840	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	*Looks so good, another awesome recipe video from you.* *Thank you so much for sharing this. Stay amazing and connected, See you around.👍💕😊*
3841	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Okay thank you, I’m going to try making the Gumbo Yaya version bc the hubs doesn’t like seafood (blasphemer), and I have celiac so I’ll swap wheat flour for gf flour (rice flower and tapioca will probably make a good roux). Wish me luck!
3842	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	It’s interesting how the stock wasn’t salted at all.
3843	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	I have a question...is this how gumbo is made or cooked in New orleans or anywhere else in america?......because in west Africa where the dish is originally from .....this is not how you cook it....like this is very wrong ..but if its how its done there then .. alright
3844	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Fantastic recipe and presentation. More of this chef please Tasty!
3845	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	This man is so Southern oml love listening to him talk 😍
3846	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	I wanted to see the chef once, who explained so well.
3847	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	I've heard of gumbo before, but now I love it although I've never tasted it :)
3848	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	I have watched many videos on Gumbo, this is my favorite. I definitely. Learned a few new tricks and ingredients. Now being how I live in Washington state I'm going to pass on getting blue crab when I have fresh Dungeness available by just placing out my crab pots. I might even add some clams at the end with the shrimp. But boy howdy this looked great. One last thing. I really enjoyed the voice of the gentleman who did this. Great story teller. Well done. 🌤👍😋🦀🦐🍻
3849	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	As a person from Louisiana. Gumbo has NOTHING TO DO WITH AFRICA! There’s no African word for okra! Why do people continue to tell that lie? Like blacks are from Africa when we are indigenous to this land!
3850	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Oh, yummy! I first learned about gumbo as a child when I watched 'Princess and the Frog' in theaters. Years later, as a college freshman, I was given the opportunity to go down South for a field trip for one of my college course assignments during spring break of that year. It was my first time down in the Southern U.S.. I went with my professor and my classmates. I remember we did stop in New Orleans and I had the gumbo there. It was delicious! I was so afraid it wasn't gonna taste good, but I'm glad I was wrong. I would make my own stock out of crabs, but I can't make it as my mom has a shellfish allergy.
3851	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Wow I ❤️ gumbo! Used to make it at a restaurant I worked @. This version is a little different from what we make, the Filé powder was added in not sprikled. So excited to try this version. 😋 Thank you!
3852	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	I know it's not the same as gumbo but it has similar roots My mama used to make a lot of jambalaya.... I really miss her
3853	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Can we all appreciate the effort of Tasty to create the most delicious recipes for us? 🥰😋🥰
3854	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Wow right in the childhood. Every time it got cold my grandma would make my siblings and I a nice warm bowl of Gumbo ☺️💜
3855	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	What is the difference between white pepper and black pepper?
3856	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	this is fate because i was just saying i craved gumbo so now i just have to make it
3857	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3I3FiK3_r8	Your consistency and quality of content never disappoints!
3858	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	Personally, I use mayonnaise 🍯 instead of butter 🧈 for a better golden brown crisp and grill marks for the grilled cheese sandwich. And it's easy on the budget too, believe me.
3859	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	If it has more than cheese, then it's a MELT, UNSUBBED
3860	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	ultimate best grilled cheese: rye bread, mozarella, parmesan, pesto, garlic and hot honey, cooked in butter... thank me later
3861	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	The 12 ingredient isn’t a grilled cheese anymore, that’s just a grilled ham and cheese sandwich
3862	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	Not.into.cheese......at.all.
3863	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	the 3 ingredient grilled cheese: the one everyone makes at home the 6 ingredient grilled cheese: the one you can get at a restaurant the 12 ingredient grilled cheese: the one people buy from gourmet sandwich shops They look so delicious!
3864	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	The pesto one sounds amazing! That last one i wouldn't call a grilled cheese lol too many extra non grilled cheese items but that's just my opinion 🤷‍♀️
3865	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	Shouldn't grilled cheese only be bread, cheese and butter?
3866	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	It’s the 6 ingredient grilled cheese for me. The 12 seems more like a panini and the 3 was a little plain. ☺️
3867	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kju2UTYd_5s	Hello

It's even sweeter than eating a spoon of sugar... but ok She even calls it ""buttery"" but then starts to put a whole pack of butter on the bread, like wow. Then after the bread can't even breathe anymore she calls American Cheese (which isn't cheese, no matter how you slice or dice it) a 'classic' ... And even when she's done baking she goes ahead and puts a tomato soup on the plate, dips the bread in and then has the audacity to say ""That really might be all you need"" To me this just screams ""AMERICAN"" so dense and so full of lies presenting things like that urgh."

3875	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlwr08vbqpk	I’ve always been fascinated with Sushi and the elegance and gentleness in the ways they are prepared but…. I just can’t eat it, anything raw I just cannot stomach it. Perhaps it’s not just for my taste but I just find the prep VERY fascinating.
3876	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlwr08vbqpk	Oh what food these morsels be!
3877	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlwr08vbqpk	I went to a Michelin starred omakase in Los Angeles last year. It was a one of a kind experience, but many of these nigiri are too harsh for my palate. I do love seeing the amount of care the chefs put in though, it’s really great to see their passion.
3878	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlwr08vbqpk	Nobody talking about the worms in fish .. sup ?

I started investing in dogecoin mid november 2020 with the help of a well-known professional. Mrs Evelyn Grace Lena, and the profit from that funded my recent duplex
3880	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlwr08vbqpk	This chef is amazing but man can u guy get some better hosts that can describe food better. Everyone just says some variation of it tastes good, you got people who's first language isn't english on other channels and they are going all out because you can tell they really love that food and they want to desribe it to you what you are seeing with your own eyes. Just wish there was a bit more effort when it came to describing food as that is a pretty important closure aspect to the video that I feel isn't fulfilled well
3881	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlwr08vbqpk	Aged sushi??!! I've never heard of aged sushi. I always ate it fresh. Very interesting! I must try this sometime! It looks good. ❤👍

3889	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Vegetable oil can suck my moustache. Lard for everything all the way
3890	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	"ok but now compare the amount of time it takes to make a quesadilla with store-bought tortillas and pre-shredded cheese (I love cheese of all kinds, do not get the hate for pre-shredded), even if you add some extras like grilled chicken, to the time it takes to make the gourmet one. how much is your time worth? because that adds to the ""cost"". not just time spent prepping your mise-en-place and cooking the food, but time spent washing up - this recipe isn't exactly a one-pan dinner, is it? yes, it tastes incredible, I've done it before. check out Kenji's recipe for a quesadilla with a shatteringly crisp crust. but 99% of the time I'm looking for a weeknight dinner that can be done in 10-15 minutes, and that's where store-bought is clutch, and that's what this video (and so many of Josh's videos) fail to take into account. if cooking is your hobby, if you don't mind spending three days on a recipe and having a pile of dishes to wash at the end, then more power to you. but Josh frequently falls into the same trap as every Food Network celebrity chef, which is that he's not cooking at home-cook scale, he's cooking at TV scale. he's more concerned with impressing people with flavor than making something realistic and easy (e.g. most Chef John, Adam Ragusea, and even Kenji recipes). do you know why the store-bought tortilla and shredded cheese taste nostalgic? because that's what your parents bought, because that's what they had the time to cook after working a 9-5 and then squeezing in their entire life around it. it's what you ate as a kid because it was practical. there are definitely ways to improve upon the basic store-bought stuff, but calling this cheaper - considering the amount of time and effort involved, even if monetarily it's not that much more per serving - is just backwards."
3891	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	The first way I learned to make a quesadilla was even worse than the basic one he showed. Same thing, except microwaved. LOL That said, there's a technique thing I feel like mentioning, for anyone who is excited about making these. Josh shows a kind of strange method for assembling them: putting the fillings on only half, folding, buttering, then putting in the pan. I can't imagine why. It is soooo much easier/better to do it as follows: put butter in the pan (a lot), put tortilla flat in pan, spread cheese over the entire circle, then place other ingredients evenly (as if making a pizza). When the cheese has melted, fold it in half in the pan. What this does is a) you don't have to deal trying to transfer a floppy buttered half-moon of raw tortilla, with ingredients spilling out of it, from the cutting board to the pan, and b) it ensures the cheese melts first, and melts fully and evenly, and is on both sides so that it glues the sides together properly. I've never seen anyone make it the way Josh shows here, and it's really just not a practical way to assemble it, and will lead to worse results and more mess. Built it flat in the pan, ya'll
3892	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	My boyfriend and I made this the other night! And again tonight, even the homemade flour tortillas. So good! Thanks 👍
3893	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I really enjoy a veggie sort of option with these as well - lotta mushrooms instead of the beef, basically. I am real interested in trying this tortilla recipe - it's quite different from the one I've been doing for a while now. Baking powder & oil vs butter. Thanks, as always. Enjoy the content. Cheers!
3894	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	nice thin tortilla! any hints from my fellow commentors on getting them that thin? Mine always come out like 1.5x too thick and get a little too chunky when I roll them myself.
3895	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Damn, just got my wisdom teeth out, and of course this had to pop into my recommended, RIP, looks amazing for sure will be trying this when im back to normal!
3896	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	You can also use any veggie as a filling with cheese. Great way to use left overs. Do not forget the green chilies.
3897	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	i've never even had a quesadilla BUTTT i'm definitely going to try this!
3898	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	As a Mexican-American, I was raised making Quesadillas with corn tortillas. I didn't have a Quesadilla made with flour tortilla until I had one at a fast food restaurant. I like them both but prefer mine at home with corn tortillas. Thank you for another great video!
3899	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	literally can't do this recipe since vegetetable oil, or any cooking oil, is completely out of stock everywhere in germany right now except for the super duper giga omega expensive stuff XD
3900	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Love ya Josh but hard disagree on oil over lard in tortillas. Maybe a mix, maybe.
3901	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	What wild be a good substitute for garlic if I'm allergic?? Or will it still taste as good without the garlic?
3902	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	As a mexican living in Mexico I've always supported your Mexican recipes, however this time I'm afraid that's not what we'd call quesadilla, actually that's a sincronizada, still a great approach tho
3903	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Okay a super non-Hispanic question, how can I store the homemade tortillas if I want to make them prior and how long can I keep them for?
3904	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I made this tonight. My son said “This tastes like something we’d eat at a restaurant on vacation.” We loved it. The cream dip was delicious. Thank you!
3905	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I'm totally bringing my family to stalk you at Amboy on the 1st. Will you really be flipping burgers or just signing books like the star that you are? Either way, we're in.
3906	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I have a pork allergy so let me say a recipe without the lard is amazing 👏
3907	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Where I can find the green salsa recipe?? 💚👀
3908	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I'm disappointed in papa cause he is using oil instead of lard.
3909	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I feel like if you put the same stuff in the store bought tortilla with pre shredded cheese, it would be pretty similar and less hassle of having to make your own tortillas and shred your own cheese. But yes, homemade looks absolutely amazing
3910	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I like most of your videos, but I would really like to see you turn simple cheap ingredients that most folks have into something beautiful and delicious. Please make that video.
3911	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	you know what has always been funny to me josh gets on people about being lazy and not making things themselves like bread for example but he uses a rice cooker you would think he would people how to cook rice without one lol
3912	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I fw this channel but do he expect me to go to my neighbors house and pay for 0.01 worth of baking power bc where they sell that at?🤨
3913	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Alright, this is a question that's needed an answer for far too long: how are you getting your rolled out tortilla disc man into the pan while keeping it in a perfect circle? Mine always ends up stretching whichever way I pick it up
3914	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Quick Q to anybody that knows, but how well does that sauce keep? Could I make it in bulk and use it over a couple weeks?
3915	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	What could you substitute the cilantro with? Because I absolutely can't stand the green parts of coriander unfortunately...
3916	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Good thing we currently can't buy flour in Germany, because the Ukraine was our biggest wheat provider and people are stockpiling it thusly. So I'll be very excited when I can try this myself in a couple of months.
3917	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	The only thing I would have preferred is just a homemade tortilla with hand shredded cheese vs the store made ingredients one. You added a ton of extras to the gourmet one, which is great, but can't compare it to the other.
3918	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	What would be a nice substitute to Monterey Jack? (Live in Switzerland)
3919	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	"""Substitute Lard for Oil"" WOw, that's horrible and easily the most un Mexican way to make tortillas."
3920	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	it’s almost as if you were watching me in the taco bell drive thru yesterday waiting 30 minutes to pay $10 for 2 quesadillas
3921	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I've been watching Joshua for long time, but these past couple of months I haven't had much time on YouTube, so I've missed a lot. Wow! Josh has 6 million subscribers now? Congrats to him! Watching this after a long time feels like coming home. So thank you for the stellar content as always!
3922	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	"I want to see Joshua do a video on how to do a week of meals but cheaper and show us the grocery shopping list and everything lol I felt that comment last week about ""i spent $20 on all this its not but cheaper"" lol"
3923	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	the only quibble i have with this series is who's going to buy 55 grams of flour unless its from the bulk section
3924	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	"I get it's cheap..ish (meat is NOT cheap where I live) and i'm definitely going to use your version for supper because it obviously tastes better but for an actually cheap and fast lunch? The first one wins hands down! No need to spend a ton of effort and time on making the tortillas, you don't have to get dishes dirty by grating cheese, cooking meat and chopping veg and you can do it all as fast as grilled cheese....it's just a far reach to compare and say ""these are pretty much the same price and effort"" when it ain't true. Great recipe though!"
3925	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I took your suggestion the other day of using a higher than 20% fat ground beef and literally brought back memories of my favorite childhood taco place. Can’t put a price on that… but it was technically cheaper than leaner beef.
3926	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	"I love these..I wonder if you could do a ""But Fancy"" I know you do ""but better"" and ""But cheaper"" but it might be cool to see like a Whopper, but fancy. The way they do at those restaurants that ""deconstruct"" things."
3927	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Can you do Icecream? Preferably an easy recipe that does not need a machine? Also Mint Chip flavor, my favorite.
3928	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Any substitute for the soapleaf? Not big on cilantro...
3929	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Sorry if I missed it, but did you post the cost per ingredients somewhere? How else would we be able to calculate the price, or are we just meant to take your word for it? Also, does it take long? If so, is it worth the time to make it homemade just to be cheaper?
3930	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Excuse me while I go make some gourmet quesadillas. 🤤 👏🏻 🧀
3931	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	ACK! Cilantro, the Devil's Dandruff! I will definitely make it, minus the soap-weed
3932	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Question I’ve been battling with this for a while now but I want to know is it bad or not normal for me to not like vegetables in most meals because I hate the texture they bring?
3933	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Where the fuck you getting ground beef less than 5$ for a pound of 73/27
3934	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	Bleu cheese is wonderful in certain applications, and if you don't like it, you can always substitute blue cheese instead.
3935	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	OMG I never thought I'd see the day GREAT VALUE made it to your kitchen. I can't even believe y'all got that brand in LA🤣I need to travel more 😣
3936	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I cringe every time he puts butter on a quesadilla
3937	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I'm weird. I like cooking my ground beef with a whisk. It' does an amazing job of breaking it down into little bits, and it works for almost anything I cook other than hamburgers. Though, seriously, I have to make homemade tortillas already. My kitchen space is almost non existent, but I have to have those. Just missing out on too much.
3938	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	The best part about this recipe is 90 + percent of these ingredients are Pantry Staples
3939	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	If we're going gourmet, I wonder whether replacing the veggie oil with olive oil would make a difference in flavor. I have heart issues, one of which is high bad cholesterol, & thus far one of the easier ways to cut down on that for me has been using olive oil instead of other fats while cooking. Sometimes it affects the flavor but sometimes not, and it's still expensive enough I try to consider this before just swapping it out

3943	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	$0.88 per serving is so misleading. You still had to buy all those ingredients full price, and they're not going to last the same amount of servings. You made a $35 quesadilla and shat on a $2 one
3944	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I have bad news for your Joshy Washy. You made a taco. If you put ANYTHING other than cheese in that tortilla, it's not a Quesadilla. Like literally by definition it becomes a taco if you add anything more than cheese.
3945	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	I’d be interested in seeing some videos in a “But Faster” series. Show us how to make quick meals at home faster than you could by driving out to a restaurant, ordering, and returning.
3946	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtpnjfDw8Kc	It’s quite literally twice the price. It CANNOT BE “But Cheaper” it could be “But Better” why not call it that?

3953	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	"""Hotpot heavily misunderstood,"" speak sins for yourself only. Just because you do have a diverse palate for foods across the world, doesn't mean you're the only one. That's my biggest annoyance with this channel, the vibe is always as if Josh is the only one who knows of these foods, as if others may not know of them. The foods are other's culture, life, love language and comfort foods."

3957	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	We’ve been eating hotpot every night for… 3 weeks now LOL. Definitely a favorite at our house. We bought individual ones which definitely makes the experience 👌🏼
3958	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I only recently found but tell me you have a cookbook of all these amazing dishes you keep making. It's really hard to keep up with the vids
3959	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Lemme see you do a sweetnspicy burger from Whataburger
3960	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	A month ago while hanging out at my parent's house i casually told my mom I wanted hotpot.. the following weekend and $150 shopping spree at the asian market later we were eating delicious hot spicy goodness. I felt sooo spoiled.
3961	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	"As Chinese, I'm amazed how RIGHT Josh did the spicy flavor pot. Just two really important tips about enjoying hot pot: 1. You need really THIN sliced beef or lamb to maximize the flavor. 2. There is actually a dipping sauce for hot pot: half table spoon of Tahini (sesami paste), 2 table spoons of peanut butter and a table spoon of sesami oil, blend well with some non-chili soup (or just hot water) till the whole thing becomes sticky but diluted. It would be the best if you can get some of the ""fermented bean curd"" in it, but it's optional. Last but not least, some chopped coriander and green onions."
3962	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	So happy to see the boys eating this together! My favorite part of cooking is watching my family eat it with enthusiasm and I usually have to just imagine your crew devouring your yummy food!
3963	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Usually the Asian recipes on this channel are pretty scuffed, but this seems pretty solid... though it's hard to beat some premade hotpot mixes. There's a reason most restaurants and families around the world use hotpot mixes, with tweaks, instead of making it completely from scratch. The sauces used here is pretty basic, and it's missing some popular hotpot dishes though. Also, no to the rice. Nobody eats hotpot with rice. That's just weird. It's not common to eat rice with Chinese hotpot, nor is it common with Japanese hotpot. Koreans sometimes eat rice with hotpot but it's almost always saved until the end where they turn the remaining broth and ingredients into a fried rice. Vietnamese and Laos also don't eat hotpot with rice. Nobody eats rice with hotpot. In general, the point of the hotpot is to enjoy the ingredients, then if you're still hungry you finish with noodles which absorb the flavor of the broth and don't take a long time to cook.
3964	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	There’s meat soo isn’t it a broth ???
3965	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Hotpot is indeed one of those meals everyone loves once they try it, but I agree it can seem quite intimidating. Every Asian culture has some form of this, but I recommend Japanese Shabu-shabu for the first timers to try making. The broth only has a few simple ingredients and doesn't require as much prep. The main differences is that Japanese style focusses more on the flavors and textures of the fresh ingredients, rather than the deep/rich flavors of the Chinese style broths. But like you said, there really are no rules.. We mix and match sauces and ingredients every time, which is almost b-weekly.
3966	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	"This take on hot pot was actually pretty good both in terms of adhering to tradition and a unique take. However, for dipping sauces, I would say the most important sauce for chinese style hot pot would be sesame sauce, or majiang. It's a mix of sesame seeds, toasted sesame oil, and a variety of other ingredients of your choosing ranging from fermented bean curd (jiangdoufu/""jiang tofu"") to tianmianjiang to even miso, and puree'd in a blender. It's the consistency and color of liquid peanut butter, and it's almost a must have in hot pot."
3967	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I've been wanting to buy my own pot like that so I can make hot pot at home. Oh my gosh. This video just makes me want to do it noooow.
3968	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	"Argh, as I was saying to myself one year ago, you'll be speaking french in no time if you keep using french words haha ! But this time it's not ""accoutrement"" (that means outfit, clothes) but ""accompagnement"" (sides for dishes). Keep the good work ! You rock ! And your ""oignon"" is impeccable, always make me giggle !"
3969	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	As a Chinese person, Thank you Joshua for making this video, hot pot is my favorite dish when it comes to gathering and with my friends and families, thank you!
3970	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	As Chinese we have 4-5 different types of hot pot. There is charcoal based lamps hotpot with salty sesame past as dip, in South we also have plain soup based all beef (fresh cut, different part) hotpot with Sacha dip, Joshua made is more a Sichuan style which is also popular in most of China. There is another coconut chicken soup based hotpot also light. There are all fish hot pot etc. maybe only popular in certain area of China but delisious
3971	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Me, a Chinese person who eats hot pot every weekend in winter: throws in a can of chicken stock and water as the non spicy base. Also, a real hot pot fanatic would never eat rice during hot pot… it’s just a waste of stomach space. Haha.
3972	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I had hot pot once when I was visiting China, and I'm obsessed! It was over 10 years ago, and the eating experience was amazing. I've always wanted to recreate it for my family.
3973	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I belive Josh is one of the best cook in terms of understanding the essence and purpose of eating.
3974	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I spent a whole£10 on your book for you not even to like my comments!
3975	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	For those of you that have an instant pot and don't want to buy a whole extra thing to be able to do hot pot, you won't be able to divide the broths the same way but you can do a one-broth hot pot by sticking your instant pot on saute mode!
3976	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	"When my (white) parents came to visit me in Japan 6 years ago, I took them to have hot pot (the Chinese type, not the Japanese nabe style). Man, my dad was SO disappointed and complained it was just ""soup with wilted vegetables and meat you have to cook by yourself"". But after the first bite, my friends, he was an enlightened man. It's a pretty famous all-you-can-eat hot pot, so I think in total we repeated everything (various meat cuts and vegetables) 3 or 4 times. He even made me take them to the same store again before they left Japan. All of this to say, nabe/hot pot is one of my favorite foods of all time. It's warm, comforting, and really delicious. If you don't have a hot pot/name restaurant close to home, please try the recipe! You will never regret it!"
3977	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Idk how I feel about a white man presenting an authentic hot pot...
3978	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	as a Chinese person i am very proud
3979	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Imagine how terrible it is to work for Josh - you get to try all these dishes but only so often and the rest of the time youre just screwed, you’d instantly start buying all the kitchen equipment to make another dose for yourself
3980	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	As a Chinese who grew up eating hot pot I RANNNNNNN when I saw the notification I'll update thoughts after watching the video Update: okay so he did the broth by himself which is A+ for effort bc we don't even do that! We just buy the base in a block/sauce form and cook it. However, he did add some twists that are not necessarily that authentic (e.g. mushroom powder). Food wise he's got cabbage and beef, but I wish he'd tried even more authentic ingredients, like tofu puff, lamb, enoki mushroom, white radish, lotus root, and if you're more adventurous blood curd and beef entrails. My favorite in the non-spicy broth is frozen tofu (you just freeze soft tofu and throw them in, literally) it will develop these honey-comb-like structures that soak up all the delicious broth, YUM! Dipping sauce wise, personally I just like to add condiments to plain Chinese-styled sesame sauce, like fermented bean curd, cilantro, green onion, chili oil, soy sauce, garlic chive blossom sauce, toasted sesame oil, and Chinese black vinegar if you like something tangy. What josh did was totally new though, and that garlic sesame sauce looks so good. I'll definitely try it out the next time I have hot pot!
3981	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Dude I was just thinking about making some, wishing there was an easy recipe out there
3982	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Hello Uncle Joshua I'd like to recommend a FIlipino dish if it is alright with you. Bulalo but better. technically a beef bone broth with thick beef skin and beef chunks would sometimes include beef bones with meat and fat.
3983	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	everybody vibing and eating the hot pot at the end just makes it even better
3984	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	For the dipping sauce: in my family our favorite is Chinese sesame paste (different to tahini as it’s toasted and thicker), sacha sauce, one cube of fermented bean curd or known as Chinese cheese, and some chili either from the base or chili oil, and cilantro and scallion! This is really good though, definitely approved Josh 👍🏻
3985	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Josh is everyone’s favorite uncle when it comes to cooking!
3986	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I had a similar dish on a hot pot in a Vietnamese restaurant, the meat is gorgeous, but the spicy part ... it's so damn spicy and you can't stop eating it! 🔥🔥🔥😋
3987	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I've only had Hotpot twice?? But it was so fun and so so good. Seeing this makes me want to find a place and have some 😔🙏
3988	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I also want to see Japanese style NABE! Beautiful looking food Josh!
3989	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Bro I’m Chinese and we don’t even make the base at home even on holidays. Truly going all the way
3990	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Can we all just appreciate the content this man and his crew makes it's just a masterpiece imagine what's he's gonna be doing the future....❤❤❤
3991	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	Hey Joshua, those budget cooking videos are insanly valuable for a lot of people. Thank you!
3992	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I haven’t even watched 1 minute yet but the thumbnail looks so freaking good. I will definitely make these to the best of my ability, papa.
3993	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EApkyOBewEw	I’d be interested in seeing some videos in a “But Faster” series. Show us how to make quick meals at home faster than you could by driving out to a restaurant, ordering, and returning.

3997	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Im sorry but i just fucking hate ghee its the worst part of oil and butter i just dont like anything oily. I used to eat with my hand when i was younger and the made me eat ghee rice, which is just ghee rice and salt and hated every moment from me touching it to washing my hands 3 times. To be fair it was only a few spoons of it but now i hate anything oily on my hands
3998	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Shut up you pus*y 😒 You just ruined it
3999	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	You have to count the time it takes to get your spices and other ingredients out of the pantry/fridge and measure them out. Having them pre-prepped is totally cheating.
4000	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	You're cheating when you have all your mise en place ready to go
4001	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	If you can play it slowly, you can play it quickly.
4002	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Too much yapping distracts from actual instructions.
4003	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Do you have a recommendation for a ghee substitute if you cannot have any dairy?
4004	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I just throw chicken thighs into a big pot with onions sautéing in butter and olive oil. Cover. Keep Cooking. Done.
4005	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	"WWhen I first heard of ""butter chicken"", I though it might be good. But it has onions, garlic, tomatoes, cilantro, and fenugreek in it, and I'm violently allergic to them. So maybe I should experiment and just cook some chicken, ginger, hot peppers, and my other favorite seasonings in butter. What was your tip for cooking rice in a pressure cooker? (I have a rice cooker, because my favorite cuisines are Chinese and Japanese)"
4006	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	how much time did it take to measure the spices out?
4007	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	thanks ethan
4008	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I don't like this series. It's pacing is so chaotic and not fun.
4009	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	You need a faster driver.
4010	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I would love to hear Josh’s explanation as to why he refuses to believe in cooking rice in a pot. It would save him so much time.
4011	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Josh's panicky, hair-on-fire cooking pace in this vid is me Monday through Friday at 6pm having just come home from work and trying to get dinner cooked for the fam. Oh how this performance soothed me. Thank you, Josh!
4012	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	copying ethan?
4013	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	As a brown girl who loves to cook. I'd recommend adding dried fenugreek leaves when you're simmering the chicken and the sauce. It really oumphs up the flavor.
4014	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Really kind of lame that you stole this idea from Ethan Cheblowki..
4015	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Josh, make baklava/kunafa. some middle eastern inspired sweets
4016	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I like this series, but Josh should pick easier dishes... So he won't need to cheat by pre-measuring / pre-prepping ingredients.
4017	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Josh, why don't you hire women? It's always men showing on your videos.
4018	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Joshy, I'm looking at your $2 butter chicken recipe on your site... assuming you replaced kashmiri (which I have) for paprika (which I also have but is weirdly more expensive haaa). Should I use equal amounts of kashmiri? Prepping for a snow storm, don't let me down!
4019	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Does Josh just watch Ethan Chlebowski to get his video ideas now?
4020	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	So you took the idea from Ethan?
4021	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	onnionnnnnnn
4022	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Whoa wait a second! How long did you cook the rice in your instant pot? I’m super curious, because my basmati turns out like a mushy mess!
4023	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	pre measured ingredients... ie, completely invalidates this cos that's half the time lol
4024	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I'm not a big fan of the But Faster series but I guess a lot of people like them. I really like the but better series
4025	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I was wondering if anyone else here also watches Ethan. This just felt like cooking in panic mode, what I like about Ethan’s videos is that he’s just cooking and cleaning as you go like you usually would at home. I think with something like the butter chicken in this video it would have been more interesting to see him try like a pressure cooker recipe or something to see if you can get a similar quality product quickly without just doing everything at breakneck speed.
4026	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	LMAO - literally, no one cooks like this, should be called but-stoopider. lol. i'm ded
4027	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Indian mom's do it in literally 15-20 mins, they multitask everything, one one side rice is cooking, on another they're searing chicken and on third they're preparing gravy.
4028	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	"""But faster"" using pre-measured ingredients is cheating Joshua. Take notes on how Ethan does but faster he's killin ya'll."
4029	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	You should do a “But” series where one of your team members asks you to make a dish BUT throws in a curveball that make it more difficult or require more creativity to accomplish.
4030	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Imma be completely honest, Josh, if I have to drive 40 minutes to get butter chicken, I'm just eating a burrito wrap with cheese and calling it a meal...
4031	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Will the ghee provide emulsification in the sauce or do you need the milk solids from the butter to do that? Looks good. Nice video.
4032	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	pro tip Josh: a half tsp on baking soda tossed in with the onions will get them to a sweet caramelized paste almost instantly. cuts like 20 min of cooking out
4033	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	A lot of the best tasting Indian food I’ve had didn’t have such a smooth texture. The sauce is usually broken but the flavors are more intense. The best one i had was at this hole in the wall in sacramento, there were crushed cardamom pods and chunks of chilies and garlic floating in the sauce. The ghee was stained a dark reddish orange and i soaked it up with naan. Soooooo good.
4034	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Don’t cover the air fryer exhaust! Instead just rotate it and bring it out from under the cabinet 👍
4035	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	From time to time i get tempted to check out the videos. Unsubbed when but cheaper started to have ingriedients like 1$/lb chicken (highly unlikely to find that), and now even in the first minute all ingridients pre measured, chicken unpacked, basically throw it together. Like yeah, put me in a fully decked kitchen with recipe and prepped ingridients layed out, sure im faster than a restaurant.
4036	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	So what you’re saying is I need to get a pressure cooker to make rice. I agree the sauce looked pretty good. Loved when your buddy said the weather was making him feel like he was losing. 😂
4037	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	God this series makes me miss Houston so bad. The supreme chill/zen of the guy getting the food...the awful traffic...the hideous strip centers...that's my city baby!! That's my home!
4038	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	The true realistic comparison would be including all the prep time including washing of pots/dishes involved with the food prep too. That's the most fair way to compare which is faster, otherwise you're just lying to yourself about how long it actually takes to fully prepare the meal.
4039	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	You know, as an Indian guy I have to say that this is a pretty good recipe (other than the chicken not having a sear). Josh was cursing himself for this being a bad way to do thing but it's not that bad. Also this is usually served with Naan or tandoori roti, but that's excusable.
4040	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	*But Better:* showing ways to make your own food better than others can make it for you *But Cheaper:* showing how to make meals that are economically sound when you’re in a pinch *But Faster:* “Don’t eVeR do this but we WILL BEAT THEM—“
4041	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Give me a house tour lol
4042	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I am an Indian and my soul went into depression for the first time watching Joshua cooking. This isn't butter chicken Nunn:'k
4043	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	As someone who doesn't eat much salt to almost none, it's always surprising to me how much salt is used in all dishes. Regardless this looks delicious!
4044	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Still not the best butter chicken yet bro... You forgot love(most important ingredient) ❤😉
4045	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I'm an Indian and my mum does it in 15 mins (everything pre prepped other than searing the chicky boizz)
4046	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	This isn’t the “but faster” I was hoping for, but it’s chaotically on brand and I’m here for it.
4047	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Curries are not meant to be cooked fast, they are better if you take some time to make them. The chicken will taste better if cooked slowly rather than quickly. Also, Indians will never use white onion as they don't exist in India, only use red onions for Indian cuisine as they are better fit for it.
4048	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	This is still good I've seen Jamie Oliver slaughter the chicken after is was dead and call it butter chicken.
4049	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	You guys should do a challenge where your team tells you a dish to make with no prep work and see how long it takes. No pre measured stuff, completely spontaneous
4050	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	"In the same vein as this new series, I would like to propose a ""... but Simpler"" version of complicated dishes, with simplified processes."
4051	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Just want to say that THIS is such a useful series. My job is teaching cooking skills for people who might be otherwise inclined to order takeout, and your videos are seriously helping to change their minds.
4052	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I think this series is your best yet as it takes you out of your comfort zone and challenges you a bit. One suggestion would be to add some sort of countdown timer in the background, I know you have the clock but I feel something with seconds as well as minutes could make it more 'intense'. Love your vids and will be making this soon :)
4053	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Butter Chicken is India's gift to the world. So damn good!
4054	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	"""I've never had butter chicken--not one time. To be honest I just found out what it looks like. I think I will like it"" ""I think I should get me a flash costume, and go pick up the food in a flash costume"" I'm only 2 minutes in, and the character development is blowing me away"
4055	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Was anyone else hoping that this series would be quicker recipes as opposed to just watching Josh have obviously quicker and better knife skills than me?
4056	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	If you want to count the time it takes to order, you need to count the time it takes you to measure out all your spices. :)
4057	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	you know what has always been funny to me josh gets on people about being lazy and not making things themselves like bread for example but he uses a rice cooker you would think he would people how to cook rice without one lol
4058	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Tastes NOTHING like butter chicken. I made it.
4059	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	"Loving this new But Faster series! I'm... also realizing that my definition of ""fast"" when it comes to food prep is severely different than most people's, though, lmao. You're still doing almost all the steps, just going at hyperdrive the whole time. So. Would love to find another series/ have you start another series along the lines of ""But Simpler."" Reduce steps and ingredients as much as possible while still getting a tasty product, bc like. I'd like to actually have the energy to eat once I'm done making my food and all 😂😂😂"
4060	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I will say I love the concept of this video but I definitely don't think you should pre portion out your spices and ingredients before hand. All of that stuff is a part of the process. And you might disagree on that and say people should be pre portioning stuff for when they make meals, I don't disagree but this recipe isn't for pro chefs or hobby cookers it's for the average Joe and they won't have that stuff done beforehand Still great idea for a new series I hope I see it more
4061	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	Butter chicken without kasoori methi? WACK
4062	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	i feel like having the ingredients already set aside and measured is cheating but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4063	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	It's nice to see Josh have the same chaotic energy as his guests in the blind cook along challanges
4064	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	This was a good episode and felt way more relatable to when I've been asked at the last minute to cook for family coming over in a hour and there's no ingredients 🤣
4065	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I don't think Josh should be allowed to have the ingredients already measured out in ramekins before he starts because regular people factor that in to the prep time for the meal
4066	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I just discovered you annndd.....Im literally drooling over everything you make sir 🤤🥺
4067	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I remember seeing a comment that said it would be nice seeing your techniques for how to make things faster, and it’s nice to see that you included some tips this time! Though I’m still pretty sure I would make this much slower, but thanks for listening to your audience Josh :)
4068	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	It was faster yes Was it perfect no Did you miss the most important ingredient that brings the whole thing together. i.e Kasoori Methi (dried Fenugreek) Yes yes you did :/ I’ll give this a 7/10 Papa, EDIT: He put dried fenugreek powder at 4:03, I stand corrected. Usually I’d put it at the end of the cooking process, but the idea and attempt to stay authentic to the flavour was there, so I’ll say GOOD JOB PAPA! I’ll bump the score up to 8.5/10
4069	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I wanna know from Vikram if Josh's Butter Chicken is better than what his mom or grandma would make at home. That would be the real comparison lol
4070	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I agree, next time you're kind of obligated to not have everything measured out cause that's a cheat code, Josh
4071	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrDJ2K3JXsA	I’d be interested in seeing some videos in a “But Faster” series. Show us how to make quick meals at home faster than you could by driving out to a restaurant, ordering, and returning.

4084	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	bro aint nowhere near me 4 lbs of chicken, much less bonesless skinless chicken is costing anywhere close to 5.09. I call total BS. That much chicken is gonna run me 12-15 easy.

4087	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Man, I always love your videos, and I've learned so much from your recipes. But I gotta acknowledge the disconnect. Where I live, four boneless, skinless chicken breasts will run you up around 15-18 dollars CAD, about 11.78- 14.14 US. 6.45 for four chicken breasts is ridiculously cheap where I'm from.
4088	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I can never get my fried foods as crispy as I want them be it chicken tenders or chicken fried steak. The meat itself isn't undercooked but the breading is soggy and I don't understand why cuz I used to watch my mom cook the same exact way for years and never turned out soggy. I dont have a cooling rack but neither did my mom so I don't think that's the problem. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
4089	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Stop using vegetable oil, you are literally killing yourself and your audience. Beef tallow or coconut oil is much healthier.
4090	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I would love the cost breakdown of these without the per-portion prorating, at least on the fresh ingredients. As someone who cooks for one (forever alone), if I need, for example, $.79 worth of cabbage, that still costs me $1.58 because I need to buy the whole head (or more if I only buy a half heads' worth in the form of something like a slaw mix to avoid the food waste). I can justify making 8 portions of chicken meals and eating them throughout to week to use up the buttermilk, OR I can justify planning a second set of meals around the leftover cabbage, but not both. Put another way, I can't use both the buttermilk and the cabbage within the expiration of both of those ingredients. By contrast, a $2 jar of chicken seasoning makes sense to prorate, because that will last *forever* in the pantry. By the same token, garlic is such a common ingredient that even though it's fresh, it's safe to assume I can use up the rest at the advertised cost per clove.
4091	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	First off, those are chicken fingers, not chicken tenders. To be chicken tenders, they have to be the tender. Using other parts of the breast makes it a finger.
4092	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Okay I’m new to this but wouldn’t it be a waste of oil or is there a way to recover it?
4093	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Lol why not add the price for the oil???
4094	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Buttermilk - it doesn't exist here in Norway. What can I use instead?
4095	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	What is the reason to choose for butter milk instead of regular milk? What is the advantage of this choice?
4096	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Now that's something i'd love to give a try, i'm just a bit iffy about the frying... so far, i've completely refrained from frying, because it just seems like a HUGE waste of oil.
4097	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I like this chanel and this video, but how do you go and get 0.20 dollars worth of salt or flour. Like where can you buy that small amount of ingredients?
4098	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Dude it is cheaper to just get fast food when you use that much oil.
4099	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Josh, been living on my own and I’m basically starving every night. Had no idea you had this series. This is going to put a 180 on my eating habits 🥰
4100	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Im all about this today, but let's be honest, chicken breast is far from the hardest protein to cook. If you dry out your chicken breast then you should resign yourself to always eating out.
4101	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	You know this guy hasn’t gone shopping. Otherwise he’d know the price of meat is up and his other dishes too. You aren’t going to have that much chicken for under $2
4102	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I'm still convinced you should do a but healthier series. Like this looks good and all, but can you make it healthier? Haha
4103	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	You have ruined fast food for me. THANK YOU
4104	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	50 cents for 450g of AP flour?? no way it's that cheap....
4105	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I prefer dry chicken tendies over moist
4106	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Taking the food cost lessons from a professional kitchen, and applying them to the home cook. Simple and effective well done. If people wonder how restaurants stay in business, this is it. Food cost $1.78 price on the menu $15.00.
4107	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	2$ , no way LOL 1 chicken breast costs more than 2$
4108	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Hey man love everything you make on this channel food looks amazing every time but… **cost of oil not included** It does mention that you use the oil that you used for the chicken to also fry the curly fries but no cost. Great Value Veg Oil(Walmart):$2.98 for 48oz Video says use 4 quarts 2.6667 bottles 2.6667 x $2.98= $7.946 $7.95 + $1.78(price listed in recipe)= $9.73 That’s every time you make it and actually almost $3 more than you said it cost to go order it somewhere. Not hate just saying might want to include that.
4109	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	@josh I legit want to know, how do you handle all the leftover oil? That is my main hurdle when I want to fry something. I don’t know what to do with all the oil
4110	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	What's with the editing effects? I feel like I'm watching a Minecraft video. Are there many 9 year old home cooks?
4111	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Im glad you addressed my only issue that i've ever had with series like these. Its understandable that we will buy a 5lb bag of flour and not go through it all, but other things like raw chicken we might not have on hand especially because it can spoil. If you could show a total cost on top of the per serving price that would be great!!! Otherwise great episode as usual! The fries looked amazing!!
4112	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	The sauce was pretty much Raising Cane’s 👍
4113	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	As soon as I finished watching this video I went right to the store and bought all the ingredients and everything turned out great! Super legit tendie meal. Although I'm not personally a fan of all the raw garlic but to each their own.
4114	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Lol Where the heck are you getting 4 chicken breasts for $5.09??
4115	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Where on gods green earth are you getting 4 chicken breasts for $5? I went to the store today and they were $30 for 5 Teach me.
4116	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	wait so you make this food at what time ?
4117	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Lucky you that food is so fucking cheap in the United states. Try minimum 6.99 a pound for chicken breast in canada.
4118	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	"I think a good way to convince the ""ohhh but it costs so much"" haters would say ""if you need to buy every single ingredient, yes, it costs $20. But if you make it again next month, itll be $2"" Also im 100% making this it looks incredible."
4119	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	"The only issue I ever have is the per serving cost calculations. While I get the ""you still have the bag of flour"" argument, that doesn't change what the grocery bill looks like when you have to buy whole units up front. This is actually a really solid one for me because you might actually HAVE the majority of these ingredients in your pantry so the up front costs aren't astronomical, but that isn't true of many of the But Cheaper series. There's also the problem of spoilage- There's none here really, but in other But Cheaper you have to buy a bunch of something and only use a small amount of it, Josh calculates that as something ridiculous like .13c per serving, and then the rest is probably going to spoil because it's not like flour in that it can sit for a long time and it isn't a common ingredient like eggs where you can just use it elsewhere. I checked out the price breakdown and some things just aren't making sense to me. Checked in my local store (I live VERY close to Josh, same state and I think same city.): (ALL in USD) Assume you have: Spices, Ketchup, hot sauce, WS sauce, Mayo (I don't but let's give him the benefit of the doubt here) 4 chicken breasts (Store brand) - 11.92 2 cups (473ml) buttermilk - 1.00 3 cups (450g) all-purpose flour - .95 2 quarts (2L) vegetable oil - 6.96 2 green onions - .44 1 lemon - .64 4 cloves garlic - .62 1/2 head green cabbage - 1.57 5 medium russet potatoes - 3.85 = 27.94 For his, he somehow got 13.58 for all the same items and he never accounted for the 2 liters of veg oil you have to buy to fry all this in. So my costs will be AT LEAST twice per serving what his are, and as it happens I don't have mayo handy so it'll actually be higher. TLDR I wanna know where he's finding 4 chicken breasts, of any quality for 5.09. Because it isn't Austin Texas in March 2022."
4120	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	"Thanks for the video my dude! Don't chirp me for this question, but do you have any good tips for making fries and strips extra crispy without deep frying or using an air fryer? I was thinking about spraying them with oil on a parchment-lined baking sheet and throwing them in the oven on ""convection bake"", but was hoping for any insight from you. Thanks in advance! 😁"
4121	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	After watching the ramen episode I'd love to see a but Expensive series to see the difference with the most expensive ingredients possible sorry for your bank balance Josh.
4122	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Joshua... Your palette is so trash thats its unidentifiable from us basics people. If us people who try to follow you, orcas will fuck you up. We dont have youtube money. Yall should be privileged. Go back to a kitchen for 30 days.
4123	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Love the video but Id also like to know the cleaning process for when you’re done.What do you do with all that oil when you’re done? How do you clean your cutting board after its been covered in raw chicken?
4124	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	How is this a 2 dollar meal if you spent $5 on the chicken alone 😂
4125	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Surprised this is a chicken recipe with no MSG
4126	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	This looks so good I almost wish I could undo my decision to make pulled pork today. Excellent video!
4127	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I am allergic to chicken (developed in adulthood) but honestly, living vicariously through this video is awesome. I miss having tendies- and this hits that nosalgia JUST RIGHT. Love it!
4128	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	You need to add the cost of the frying oil to your breakdown.
4129	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Yes Josh but you forgot to consider that I need to buy a pan, a pot, a spoon, a stove, a house, the food that gives me the energy to make the chicken, and I need to pay my taxes which ACTUALLY brings this meal to $253,678
4130	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	okay this is one i really want to make but i would probably make the alteration of making a chicken sandwich with the sauce, tenders and some slaw. love this series so much, it really makes me want to cook more, keep up the good work papa
4131	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	You didnt include the price of the Oil?? An entire bottle... Probably the most expensive single ingredient... Where do you find food so cheaply?? I havent been able to purchase food at these prices for years. I live in CA... Looks good, but cheaper? Probably not... I Guess, literally every time you make food from scratch it will be cheaper than having someone else prepare and serve it to you.
4132	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	This looks to be also a somewhat but better on raisin cane's
4133	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I’m sensing a jab at canes….
4134	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I'd like to know where in the U.S. he got 4 skinless , boneless chicken breast for that price! I'll go stock up now
4135	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	you know what has always been funny to me josh gets on people about being lazy and not making things themselves like bread for example but he uses a rice cooker you would think he would teach people how to cook rice without one lol
4136	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Honestly, the biggest thing keeping me from doing more frying at home is the cost of oil when I'm only cooking for 1-2 people. It just adds a few extra dollars for one meal since fried leftovers don't keep well.
4137	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Hey Joshua, those budget cooking videos are insanly valuable for a lot of people. Thank you!
4138	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Cutting chicken breasts into strips doesn’t make them “tenders”… that’s a specific muscle. Just like you can’t cut a piece of Chuck into a “tenderlion”.
4139	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Yess, a lot of chefs don't add spices to the buttermilk or the dredge, *this* is how you make proper fried chicken! But I think it's important to factor in the cost of cooking oil as well, as you won't be able to re-use this oil much.
4140	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	"Alternately, to get really thinly sliced cabbage. You can use a vegetable peeler. Faster than a knife and less danger to the ""fingies"""
4141	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I love the full price breakdown, and I hope y'all do it going forward. Chicken looks delicious btw.
4142	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	"Love the video Papa!! Was the vegetable oil for frying included in the overall cost? I know that it's a ""pantry staple,"" but I feel like a lot of folks only have one bottle of oil at home at a time (unless one stocks up/purchases the gallon sized jugs.) Anytime I plan to fry anything at home I normally need to buy another thing of oil in advance to have enough for my heavy bottom pot."
4143	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Perfect timing. I just told my wife I want to try my hand at making handmade chicken tenders for my toddler. So far we've only done baby appropriate baked walnut coated chicken tenders but she deserves some full on deep fried goodness
4144	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Thank you papa. I was craving some trendies today
4145	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	4 boneless chicken breasts are at least $12 near me...
4146	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Hey Josh! two quick questions. Would chicken thighs work for this or would they be tooo fatty? and secondly, How well would this freeze to be eaten later, and at which stage would it be best to freeze and reheat?
4147	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Can you give us tips on an efficient deep fry oil system? Where we can reuse such a huge amount of oil?
4148	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	Frying food, now makes you a chef 😂

4153	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeDMZIB8dg8	I’d be interested in seeing some videos in a “But Faster” series. Show us how to make quick meals at home faster than you could by driving out to a restaurant, ordering, and returning.

4161	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Wow, despite the hefty price tag, with the way they both present it, looks like it may be worth it in the end.
4162	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	They are spoders of the sea and meant to eat up the scum of the ocean floor. not suppose to eat it
4163	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Morimoto has never lost a challenge in the masterchef kitchen, he is the Rolls Royce of chefs!
4164	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	The $500 price may be what you pay for a whole king crab on the East Coast (where Gordon's restaurants are) but it's WAY cheaper in the Pacific Northwest. I can go to a regular grocery store and buy legs for $20 to $25 per pound. You can buy snow crab for about half that price, but since the meat-to-shell ratio is only half that of king crab you end up paying the same for the actual meat, you have to spend more time and effort breaking it down, and I don't think it's as tasty.
4165	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Absolutely no way it's justified to give those Alaskan King Crabs a 500$ price tag!!!!
4166	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	i love how they add subtitles even when its clear what he's saying
4167	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	He’s fucking yanking the legs off a crab and these Hollywood gentiles pretending as if man is landing on Neptune. Bunch of dick sniffers.
4168	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Since when is one crab $500?
4169	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Yeah, we sell those crabs here for around $40/lb raw and serve them in restaurants and diners in the $60-$90/lb range. Average size king crabs, one claw and two legs is usually pretty close to a pound. I like to buy a case of them with a few lobsters and some crawfish and have a huge seafood boil. Poach it off in a nice court boullion with tons of cajun seasoning and make a lovely compound butter to dip it in. Fantastic
4170	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	It cannot be understated how hard it is to actually do this. Crab meat is very stringy and can be very difficult to get cleanly out of some parts of the shell. To be able to take apart a crab so cleanly you can basically put it back together takes insane amounts of practice.
4171	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Seriously? People can’t take it out and put it like that? How hard can it be?
4172	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	None of those reactions were necessary.
4173	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	But how about head of crab?
4174	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Gordon: *farts* Contestants: Groundbreaking 😭😭😭😭😭 😑😑😑😑😑😑
4175	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	What I keep looking at is the juice that comes out of that cooked crab. If ANYONE has had the luxury of breaking down a crab like that on your own, you know that you are sucking on every last bit of those crab legs before you get the meat out. It is like nature's perfect soup that needs no seasoning. Also, boiling the shell after for a broth, simmering it down and adding it to the drawn butter: HOLY GOD you have never had anything like it.
4176	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	500 for that? You got fookin ripped off mate
4177	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	glad I hate crab. no way I'd pay $500 for any meal much less one shitty crab

4186	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	$500 for a crab what the f*** has the world come to
4187	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Crab, especially king crab in general is to die for! I have had king crab once and it was hands down, one of the single best things I've ever eaten in my life. Period.
4188	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Id rather a few Dungeness in garlic lemon butter then spending $500 for a red king specialy since I can just walk 2 minutes down the road to catch them on a $35 license plus they taste better when you catch them yourself and aren't paying some douche bag over priced fisherman boat off
4189	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Fun fact: king crab aren't actually crabs. They are merely crab like crustaceans, but arent very closely related. There's this process in nature callcalled carcinization, which details how crustaceans all inevitably converge upon the same design as crabs. Hermit crabs are another example, they arent crabs either.
4190	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Those people are very easily impressed.
4191	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	It's amazing how with the power of television they are able to make us think they did all that on the 1st try with only 1 crab
4192	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	No way that's a $500 crab, especially back in 2019. I used to work in a seafood department and you could probably get that weight of crab in pure legs (no body with all the goop and guts) for like $150.

4198	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	500$ is at a high end restaurant. You can buy it and make it at home for much less. Definitely a special occasion dish but people should’t be scared to try it!

4200	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Morimoto was amazing on Iron chef years ago.
4201	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	$500?!?! Pre-covid HEB in Texas had whole king crabs for like $150.
4202	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Well, I would never have to worry about messing up a $500 king crab because I would never get close enough to even look at it.
4203	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	The fact these people are amazed at basic food break downs ramsey does on these shows makes me question if they've ever even cooked at all. Smh
4204	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	"Every time I eat King crab, I think ""I'd rather be eating Dungeness."" Even if I spend $200+ on King, I've just never had a good experience with it."
4205	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	I'm questioning the $500 price tag. King crab legs are $45 per pound currently. Maybe counting airfare to fly it in.
4206	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	They must mean $500 when served in a top gourmet restaurant. I'm having a hard time finding $250 out of this crab when other things are on the plate too. Then again, it's been a while. Maybe nobody is offering King right now. King is my favorite. Its spikey armor is punishing, but the inside is worth it.
4207	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	"The fact that people let alone ""chefs"" are amazed by this is mind blowing! WTF!!"
4208	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Wish I could afford to eat stuff like this everyday. Imagine how healthy I'd be if I wasn't antibiotic, hormone raised, and corn fed.
4209	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Morimoto is my favorite chef when I first saw him he was on iron chef
4210	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	"0:20 It's embarrassing that you call him ""Merry Mowdow""!"
4211	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	A truly.magical.king crab is being turned into a lump carcass. It's pathetic
4212	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Gordon: This crab is $500 think of yield Fisherman: Oh yeah we use them for bait It's kind of funny how chefs will price things based on locale, season, waters etc while your average catch fisherman wouldn't even value this shit above $20 because they pull them up by the truckload
4213	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	In the 50's I lived in Palmer Alaska, Dad used to stop at the docks in Anchorage and get one once in a while. They were $1.00 right off the boat and the size was a good deal bigger than this. We were a family of 9 and one King Crab would feed the whole family. The best Crab, no doubt.
4214	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	that moment when gordan looked over at mosimoto handleing the king crab with a knife was pure shock and awe and respect at the same time
4215	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Has anyone seen my mom?
4216	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Everyone: “Oh my goaaash” Me living on the South Carolina coast: “All you can eat snow crab legs every Wednesday” I got this down just like Ramsey lol.
4217	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Sometimes I see Gordon on talk shows burning food and stuff and wonder if he can actually cook, but then I see him on here breaking down a king crab like an expert and I know he can
4218	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Imagine being so respected. People cry of joy seeing you do what you love.
4219	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Just think, back in the 90's this crab was sold in all you can eat $15 chinese buffets. And now it's $500. How far things have fallen...
4220	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Bit annoyed they didn't talk about one of the best parts, the innards. Not amazing by themselves, but great to mix into dishes.
4221	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	That blue knife Morimoto is using at 1:32 is stunning. I don't even want to think what that cost.
4222	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Thats what Morimoto and Gordon have in common: they both respect the ingredients.
4223	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	King crab nowadays: $500 Peasants selling crabs for a penny in medieval times: I was born in wrong century
4224	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	“A crab like this would cost about 500$” and think there’s people who have access to catching these beasts everyday and and spend only 20$
4225	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	i love how they get emotional about all the different chefs, when the most famous chef on earth is around them 24/7
4226	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	0:34 why would someone cry when a chef is going to dissect a king crab
4227	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	500$ for a crab like that??? Holy shit. I wonder if they can get even more expensive?
4228	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Gordon: *taking a dump* Contestants: wow Gordon:🤨 “get f out here” Contestants: wow Gordon: *OMG*
4229	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Ramsey : Removes a crab's foot every contestant : WOOOOWWW
4230	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	I was literally drooling watching this. I love snow crab and I have always wanted to taste Alaskan king crab, so this is simultaneously heavenly and torturous to watch.
4231	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Amazing how far Nick has come from his days in master chef. He seemed so unsure here, but I recently watched a video of him making an incredible dish with king crab. What a lad!
4232	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	500 dollars at expensive restaurant 36 dollars a pound at boiling crab joint
4233	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Wtf is Gordon on TRT?!
4234	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	"Let joe do this and ruin it all. And the contestant say ""You are the problem"""
4235	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	whats great about eating king crabs is depending on where they're harvested you're helping wipe out an invasive species. Like there's a clip from a show of Gordon catching and cooking one in Norway in the winter where they're a pest species so it's like tasty seafood and helping certain environments. (I don't support over fishing of any fish to detrimental levels unless it's an invasive species in the region you're fishing it from. eg. ASIAN CARP in like anywhere that Europeans introduced them and they're massacring native species like in Australia and regions of America.)
4236	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Was it me or there is someone who look like nick Giovani in this video
4237	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Look, I love to cook & love a well cooked meal. But watching a master in their craft is always a treat, no matter what it is. I’ll never be at Gordon’s level, but it’s so satisfying to watch.
4238	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Gordon Ramsay: and that is how 2 Masterchefs break down a King Crab.. Morimoto: ahemm.....no. Excuse me, but Im an Iron Chef.
4239	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Can we talk about How everyone is Wowing, while Nick is like extremely focused.
4240	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Casual reminder that all of these people were watching 2 men remove every limb from a creature and completely rip it apart
4241	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	we buy 4 legs from costco for like 50 dollars LOOL
4242	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	I'm gonna keep it 99 and round up. I don't want to see a cook off between chef Gordon Ramsay vs Bobby Souffle. It's a waste of money and time cause we all know that Gordon Ramsay would win. BUT I do want to see chef Gordon Ramsay vs Masaharu Morimoto
4243	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	0:17 there he is, nick digiovanni!
4244	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	A crab like this can cost $500. Me: spitting it back out cause i shoveled it all in in one bite.
4245	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	"Take a shot everytime they say ""wow"""
4246	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	500 dollars? Huge ripoff 20 per pound at most
4247	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Gordon: *talks* Contestants: wooow whatttt oh my god why am I tearing up.
4248	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	When he said “I catch them everyday but not like that” i thought he was talking about something else 😂🤣
4249	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	"""pablo picaso"" sounds like pablo escobar and picaso mix"
4250	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	*_Perfect hairlines don't exi..._*
4251	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Ramsey loves the spotlight and getting his wows from people even during the prep work.
4252	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Morimoto doesn't seem like he's on the same level as Gordon Ramsay
4253	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	How are they $500, they’re literally every where. They’re invasive in some places
4254	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Wondering why the crab heart wasn’t highlighted as a prized & rare piece of this majestic beauty?!?
4255	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Poor Noah. He'll never be able to experience the joy of eating king crab due to his shellfish allergy.
4256	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	1:43 he messed that up.
4257	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	2:14 my reaction right now
4258	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	WTF? Those ppl are acting like Jesus came down on a cloud to smash some crabs.
4259	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	"Youtube is so fucking worthless now. Bullshit cable television. Sorry Susan ""authoritative"" television. FUCK YOU"
4260	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	You don’t want to waste any of it. Doesn’t even talk about the body/head of the crab 🤦‍♂️
4261	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	500$ wait I thought these are pests in the ocean...wtf😑
4262	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Most expensive First caviar Second king crab Third lobster
4263	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	I've been recreating what Ramsay makes with his tutorials and its pretty good I think we have the same taste or he just really knows his shit😂😂😂
4264	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Could you make crab nuggets from a chunk of meat from the claws?
4265	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	That fuckin crab is older than me fuck me
4266	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	King clab! 0:00
4267	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Me: I wanna try some crab! Ramsey: A crab like this can cost up to 500 dollars. Also me: Oh hell no.I’m good
4268	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Gordan Ramsey: **breathes** Audience: wOoooOooOwWww
4269	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	WTF, just a fcken crab, not rocket science. LOL
4270	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	500 dollars for that crab, at the most expensive seafood restaurants they don't even ask that price, damn?
4271	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Catching king crabs is not hard at all, so for them to have such a high price is just insane. This is coming from someone who catches king crabs often
4272	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	0:50 15yr old 😂😂😂 equal to my age nearly
4273	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	Literally my two favorite chefs of all time.

4278	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	A master chief would pick the body meat of a 500 dollar crab

4280	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSa6n-b7d8o	woah... first?! 😮
4281	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"I just heard ""cook them twice, super healthy"". We are talking about a fryer, ladies and gentlemen. Gordon, what the f*ck do you call a sallad? UberMegaSuperHealthy? Please.."
4282	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	For a person who preaches simple preparation, sure made this recipe complicated.
4283	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I'll deffo try your fish and chips but stick with my marrowfat peas soaked with BIC of soda tablet thanks
4284	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	It's cool to see Gordan just cooking and having a great time.
4285	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	fake chef, just a showman. how many times you need to add salt to the fish??? and couldn't you do all the things in parallel?
4286	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	white people food are horrible
4287	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	But my local fish and chip shop gives me a full portion; any advice on what to eat afterwards to actually fill up?
4288	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Cod has worms. This is why every culture that lived off of this type of fish salted it for days to make sure those little buggers were gone. We are learning from YouTube and not a great grandparents which is a shame. Try Indian fish fingers. Much tastier, safer and fun to prepare.
4289	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"I will never forget the game of ""just the tip"" while making fish and chips"
4290	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Fish and chips are racist.
4291	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Why does he talk like this? “SHAKE the fish IN the frier, then just GENTLY turn it over and allow it to cook BEAUTIFULLY for about SEVEN minutes…” 😂
4292	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Fun fact. Gordon is an FTM. A female to male transgender. One hundred percent true.
4293	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"""healthier"" ""super healthy"" those expressions should not be used when it is about frying something. anything. Gordon, you may increase your wealth and be less half-wit at the same time. that is possible."
4294	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Gordon: “How do you serve fish and chips without lemon?” Also Gordon: *Proceeds to serve fish and chips with lemon*
4295	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I give the Golden chainsaw to the poor lemon that got sliced
4296	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Fun Fact: Before James A. Janisse made videos for Dead Meat, he used to work for Fox Entertainment. This is one of the videos he edited
4297	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I could've gone my whole life without knowing James a Janise edited this video
4298	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Can't believe this was James a Janice's work.
4299	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Did he say that the fries are healthy?
4300	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	First time i'v heard about Fish n chips, i thought it was just a name for some rich culture complicated dish, then it turn out to be just a fried fish fillet and a potato chips. Totally dissapointed.
4301	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	What can I use instead of beer in this recipe?
4302	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Gordon works so fast I have not got a Scooby Doo what the batter entails.
4303	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	This man is a legend. Even if he does boil an egg and upload it on YouTube, people across the globe gonna watch it several times
4304	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	PIZZAAAAAA
4305	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I love how chefs can handle food that’s straight out of boiling oil
4306	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	To this day I'm convinced that Gordon gets turned on when he cooks and plates up food.
4307	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Any alternative for beer because I don't consume alcohol.
4308	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Looks EZ
4309	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I'd like to see a show where Gordon goes into random homes and tries to cook something with what they have in the fridge.
4310	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I need some help pls. I am a 16-year-old therefore I cannot get access to beer. Are there any other good alternatives I can use to make the batter?
4311	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Fish and chips served with fries!!! Why would you want fries with it?
4312	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	For everybody , who have seen “Pulp fiction”, that Tartar sauce is the mayonnaise, that we in Europe are eating with chips and other fried meals instead of ketchup. ;)
4313	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"""Taunt it first"" Me: haha bet you wish you were swimming with the other fish weren't you?"
4314	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"""This is where it gets messy, but exciting!..."" Suuuure..."
4315	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Are these peas frozen? Gordon: Fresh Frozen No such thing.
4316	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"""What if you don't have a deep fryer?"" ""Can you just use a regular pan?"" ""Somebody tell me please."""
4317	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I've never had any fish and chips in my life that weren't unbelievably greasy.
4318	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	What the F (word ) oil was used in the fryer ??? get your S (word ) together !
4319	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Anyone else love how Gordon says “beautiful”? 😂😂
4320	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Why does Gordon whisper everytime he plates the food?
4321	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	hmm, Gordon's passionate about the dish because it's his comfort food. one of my comfort foods from when i was growing up was when my mum made some amazing fried oysters, and later i stumbled upon some mouth-watering sweet potato fries from a local deli. I've never tried making the former or the latter, but I love to experiment and I bet I can take inspiration from both and make something special: fried oysters and sweet-potato chips (i hope I don't ruin it, hehe *crosses fingers*)
4322	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I really don’t think cooking fries twice makes them “super healthy”. Maybe it makes them a little better but super healthy?? It’s still carbs with fat cooking it twice doesn’t make it a tomato.
4323	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"Gordon: ""The fish is piping hot"" Also Gordon: *holds them like they aren't even warm*"
4324	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	If Gordon was a cannibal he would cook his humans medium rare.
4325	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	So can I use any beer for the batter or do you use a certain kind of beer
4326	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Ну что я могу сказать
4327	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	How many eggs Gordon? How many eggs?? you'd think that with the importance of the batter he would talk about how much beer/eggs ect. otherwise what's the point. Details!
4328	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Has anyone els watched this more than once and never makes them anyway?
4329	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	“Butter gives your arteries a glossy finish...beautiful!”
4330	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Im actually confused as to why gordon actually treats his chefs like a football team. Dude its a kitchen and i guarantee you would not like me when you open that mouth other than that i used to be a fan but im getting quite fed up with the anger. Hopefully you're truly working on it as the tabloids stated few years back.. here let an American conflict your food gordon. One you forgot the vinegar and 2 you FORGOT THE VINEGAR AND THE SALAD CREAM tartar is bleh... id rather have the real deal The british way. Here you made fish and fries with mushy peas man...
4331	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Gordon cooks like a 5 year old needing to go pee. Stand still man!
4332	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Why in gods name aren't we being shown how to make the most bloody important ingredient, THE BATTER!!?
4333	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	(Gordon's wife giving birth to matilda) Gordon: 1 2 3 and push! (Tilly comes out) Gordon: *BEAUTIFUL....*
4334	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	My grandma made this almost exactly here in Arkansas. She never bought fish, it was up to us kids to get the local fish fresh. I'm not sure what the potatoes were, but I remember digging them out if the garden.

4337	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	The death of Stan Lee and Rick May, Covid-19 and now Gordon uses frozen peas. The apocalypse is truely upon us.
4338	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"Just 3 comments - the most amazing ones 1) He must be the only ""chef"" that uses frozen primary ingredients, yet he's cursing the ones who served him frozen food 2) I thought the Brits are so special and unique that eat their fish using the unique and amazing malt vinegar, instead of lemon who every other boring nation in the world does 3) Is he forcing the viewers liking his food by using such wording?"
4339	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Hi, any help with a vinegar free tartar sauce? Thankyou
4340	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I love how he explained everything, from step to step..really awesome :)

4358	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	the fish would be freezing cold, the chips, lukewarm, and the peas the warmest,.. mmmm,could do with seeing that batter being made, rather than a super-quick mention of what it is.

4360	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	“Taunt the fish first then lay it away” I swear in every recipe, Gordon adds a bit of unnecessary extra steps just to make it sexually pleasing.

4378	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	My one problem with homemade fish n chips is the sheer quantity of oil, the smell of oil, and the disposal of all that oil.

4396	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I don't know why I waste my time watching any Gordon Ramsey YouTube videos. He never disappoints with being underwhelming and complete let down. In this video he made American french fries instead of proper British chips. Then he leaves the batter over night in the refrigerator. Seriously?! Any bubbles from the beer are going to be long gone before using it to deep fry the fish! You can plainly see the batter has fried up a bit like a dough and separated from the fish filet. The batter was over beaten and developed gluten. Not good! :( Mister Ramsey, you need to go back to culinary school and relearn how to be a chef instead of a flashy television cook with a dirty mouth.

4404	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	If you served those peas in yorkshire you would be wearing them very quckly.. Mushy peas are made over night and not from frozen peas. Ffs Dried peas soaked then boiled next day for couple hours till they fall sweetened with a little sugar They dont need mashing .. They fall into a thick mushy state Hense the name mushy peas... Its an old dish to use up late season overgrown peas..
4405	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Dude.... The fish is way cold........ You can't serve that Mr. Master chef.............. 😑😑

4411	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	He has been overated and overhyped. There are a lot better chefs in the world than him.

4413	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I made this last night, to the letter. My 85 year old mother exclaimed, “This is the best fried fish I’ve ever had”. Thank you Mr. Ramsay!

4417	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Let’s play a game : every time Gordon says “Crispy”, Drink some olive oil
4418	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Gordon: Alright so today we're gonna be making some of my favorite cereal, cornflakes. Right olive oil in, pan on, salt peber
4419	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	How much you wanna bet gordon just batters and fries the fish and only adds salt and pepper to the fries and eats em with ketchup when he's at home
4420	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Did he just say dish and chips is not complete without peas? Wtf ?? I have never gotten peas with my fish and chips....lol...
4421	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I totally agree with the method of using Yukon gold potatoes for the chips first cooked at a lower temperature and then cranking up the heat. When I was a kid making fries I tried to share this technique with my Dad but he wouldn't listen but I am the Queen a great fries. The fish Gordon did was excellent. I just wouldn't mash u those peas. I also find butter too rich so I would just use a touch of olive oil. I definitely would put lemon on my fish but hold the tartar sauce.
4422	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Where the F is the Malt vinegar? you muppet!
4423	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Gordon: I use frozen peas all the time Everyone: Wait, that's illegal
4424	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	That is not what mushy peas should look like. And I thought he was an amazing chef and he be messing up the mushy peas

The king of Fish and Chips is Haddock. His poxy peas, I wouldn't give them to the cat, it is Mushy peas or nowt. Chips is chips. You can have this info free.
4430	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	For once id rather eat a takaway fish n chips this dish isnt big enough 😂
4431	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Poor example of cooking, by the time the mushy peas are done everything else has gone cold, also no to parsley or pepper on chips!
4432	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I wanna make this but I'm confused on 1 part, the part with the fries, do i just peel them without any washing beforehand?
4433	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Technique question: Why weren’t the shallot and garlic sautéed in the pan first prior to adding in the peas?

4501	220	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Peas with fish and chips? That's a first for me. Nowhere I've had fish and chips at has served peas on the side.
4502	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Season the fish, 3 seconds later remove the season with a towel lol. Makes no sense
4503	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	What is this man talking about? I can literally see these floppy chips bend in the video. Don't lie to me about how crispy they are!
4504	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	4:53 listen to this part with headphones in 😂😂😂
4505	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I always thought Malt Vinegar was the classic dipping side to go with fish and chips?
4506	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	2:21 - Chips, Gordon! You've spent too long in LA
4507	226	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	He just picked up a fried fish with his bare hands Edit: 2:09

4510	229	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"""Fish & chips, my go to comfort food"" Yeah that is because you have got no other option. What else has Britain got? Haggis or Jellied eel!"
4511	230	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Was it just me or did he grab the fish right after it came out of the fryer? Like I would imagine that would be so fcking hot
4512	231	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Nicely done mate but we Britts usually saturate the entire plate with malt vinegar.
4513	232	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	“Now just lightly season your fries” *5 seconds later* “Now rub the seasoning off”

4522	241	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Wow.... Good to know fries are healthy 😉
4523	242	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	"why did he say ""Fries"" at the beginning?"
4524	243	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Is there any other way to make the batter without beer?
4525	244	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Season your comments first before posting it.

4528	247	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Me: How much salt do you want? Gordon: yes

4533	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	did he say 'frozen' peas? I'm shocked. Hopefully none of the restaurants on Kitchen Nightmares see this ;P

4540	259	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	he actually just said putting salt on the deep fried fish will make it more crispy...wtf is he talking about.
4541	260	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	how much beer?!
4542	261	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Never heard of mushy peas with fish and chips. Is that a common thing in the UK with this dish, or just something Gordon made up?
4543	262	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	So fish n chips... where are the chips?
4544	263	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I love how passionate he is about food people call him mean he just takes it very seriously
4545	264	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Another phony chef.
4546	265	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Where is the Tartar Sauce!
4547	266	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	naw, the real fish and chips = sold in the cold rainy streets of London, wrapped in flimsy newspaper while still hot so the ink blends in for additional flavor, fish with head and bones and everything, etc.
4548	267	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Made this tonight, minus the peas because I knew I couldn't eat it all. One piece cod, one piece haddock. Absolutely the best fish & chips I've ever had in my life, including the tartar sauce. Made the batter with 7 Up instead of beer and used Chef John's recipe for remoulade sauce for the tartar sauce since it uses the same ingredients except he used 2 kinds of pickles. Gordon's suggestion of using Gherkins was spot on. Great video!
4549	268	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I felt like he was trolling me. Was taught to make beer batter right before so its light with carbonation. And always told to boil and wasg potatoes to remove starch for crispy. However im gunna throw all that out the window and do this tomorrow.
4550	269	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	But how does he make those fries? Like I mean like does he tell the patato and then cut the fries?
4551	270	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	YOU USE FROZEN PEAS!?
4552	271	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	How much food did he waste
4553	272	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	This guy sold out faster than Madden 18. Where is the malt vinegar?
4554	273	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	The moment he starts plating the dish, it's erotic ASMR 4:50
4555	274	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	JEEZ IF I WOULD HAVE HAD THIS WHEN I LIVED IN THE UK I WOULD APPRECIATE MORE BRITAIN'S FISH AND CHIPS. But all fish and chips I had was disgusting and always frozen...
4556	275	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	5:31 does anyone know the song or is it a song

4560	279	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	How much beer do u need and what type of beer . And what type of cod can someone tell me pls
4561	280	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	He says to use eggs in the batter. NO! Every other decent chef says NO EGGS and that is true. People like Ramsay tell you LIES in the recipes so yours never turns out as good as theirs. I was once told to use salt on my pork joint to crisp the crackling' All it did was BURN IT BLACK AND RUBBERY. Now, I just use searing tmp first, then lower for longer and no salt. Beautiful every time.
4562	281	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Gotta love Gordon's seductive voice when he's describing his food.
4563	282	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Fries? They are chips and there's not enough of them.

No Ramsay , adding some mint doesn't make it healthy . You beg a fucking belief . Where's the fucking vinegar . And there's no caper in the original sauce tartare recipe you twat .

They always get it from this local resyaraunt and the food is absolutely disgusting. I want to tell them how I much I hate their shitty fish fry but they are old and I haven't got the heart.
4649	368	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	That’s all? And we pay what? 50-100$ for that plate? Heck naw me be like “IM COOKING TODAY!” After 1 hour. -house on fire. RIP fish.-

4670	389	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	I just watched two other BRITISH chefs demonstrate their take on the classic Fish and Chips. I noticed that they BOTH used turbot, a type of flatfish. Now, I might be wrong. But what if turbot is the fish that makes up all the fish and chips in Britain. And the only reason Gordon is not using turbot, his actual favorite to use, is because that fish would not appeal to the American people. I mean, it's a wierd fuckin looking fish, I'd eat it. But I bet u many Americans would be hesitant.
4671	390	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	In order for the salt to actually gather any of the moisture it would of needed to sit on the fish for at least an hour..way easier to just use a paper towel to dry it out since youre rubbing away the salt anyway, then just adding some salt to season...very weird request from Gordon I guess hes trying to look more professional
4672	391	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zit9l5jtbws	Wow holy shit, did he touch the fried fish with his bare hands while it's still dripping hot oil.

4756	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Just to say that i did it at home, following all the steps, using best ingredients, it came nice and clean as it looks on the video. But boy, it is not delicious, it’s good. The issue is that the egg and the sauce are too strong for the delicate savor of the crab. Honestly it is a waist of perfectly good and expensive crab. I did it again using smoked saulmon, it is far better.
4757	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Totally overrated chef. Shannon Bennett should be teaching these people how to cook
4758	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	All Gordon's shows seem staged af.

4797	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Why does a cooking show need so many dramatic quick camera shots, and such intense powerful music? Americans, over dramatising everything.

4804	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	It's fairly easy to poach. Vortex, then drop it. Be patient. You're done. Too early, too soggy. Too late, too hard. I don't really understand all those exxagerated comments with regards to poaching, but perhaps, personal opinion abounds.
4805	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	"Josh - The title you put on this video is grammatically wrong. In English, the plural form of ""crab"" is still ""crab."" There is no ""S"" added to the word. Your title should read ""Crab Benedict"" not ""Crabs Benedict."" No one in the entire video ever says ""crabs."" Gordon Ramsay clearly says ""Crab Benedict"" (0:22 & 2:47) both times that he identifies his dish. The only time in English the word ""crabs"" is ever used is in reference to genital lice, a sexually-transmitted parasite. That little ""s"" makes a huge difference in meaning. Please correct the title."
4806	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	"""Light dusting of paprika"" Yeah right"
4807	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	I would like to see Gordon compete in one of these competitions to see if he lives up to his reputation.

The competitors have to go through alot of physiologic test before even getting into to the show its not about how thry cook the producer's want to control the competitors mind that goes very smoothly with their plot show If u guys think for moment this show is fair and square doing your homework and research in google and u find the dark side about this show
4810	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Sounds like a medical condition.
4811	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	I see marcos teaching in ramsays cooking. That looks amazing!!
4812	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	But, Gordon! You didn't put the poached eggs in ice water to keep them from overcooking!
4813	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	"Who refers to their own cooking as a ""mahsterpiece""??"

4818	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Looked good at first. Then I found out it has raw eggs in it.
4819	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Thumbnail looked like an illness.
4820	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	My 'AMAZING' Crabs Benedict. Btw, poaching an egg is not a easy task in itself, that was bloody brilliant by the mate Gordon.
4821	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	The way the audience nods and makes the most cringe comments.....
4822	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	savages, pouring the shredded remains of their brothers/sisters on top of them. this humiliation will not stand! the chickens will retaliate in hordes....Link knows all too well.

4824	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Whenever you see Gordon with olive oil, it’s more than just a “little”
4825	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Sounds like a STD.
4826	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Why are all of them so serious?
4827	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	The music is ruining this show for me. It’s unnecessarily dramatic, way too loud, and distracts from what Gordon is saying. What a shame.
4828	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Now I get why so many people fail recreating Gordan's dishes. That man does not know the meaning of slow down.
4829	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	What season is this?
4830	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	This thing is easy. I’m sure I can do it at home without rewatching this video. 😏

4832	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	"""Thats sexy"""
4833	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Is poaching eggs really difficult for people..? It's quite easy... Why there's so big deal about it in the comments? This dish is simple..ofcourse they make it look hard with the commentary and the delicate handling and elegant execution...
4834	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	isn't that the guy who plays sherlock?
4835	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Bendthatdick counterstrike?
4836	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	A fair amount of hype, but fair go, those eggs were poached perfectly. Of course nobody will ever know how many takes it took, but I can tell you, that is SO hard to get right. So simple, and so difficult, both at once. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered poached eggs and gotten either golf balls or goo in frogspawn. Give the man his due, he did it right.

4840	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds5MbgbXLBo	Looks easy, but when making it yourself, it's not. I wanna try making one.

4850	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	I wonder how humans become like slaves and stand in a line just for taste. Also for some other products like iPhone. And these same people preach the importance of time,effort,etc at their old age. Strange

4855	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	He hopes that his business will last for a few decades yet he doesn't prioritize in expanding his business. He should at least find a solution for that queue as standing and waiting in line for 30-1 hour for a comfort food defeats its purpose if you ask me.
4856	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	man this looks so delicious. I looked for it on uber in my city and none of the japanese restos sell it! what a let down.
4857	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	The food itself looks amazing but i think its a little too much greasy tho, too much excess oil when you transfer the chicken and egg to the bowl.
4858	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	Ah yes Oyakodon... my favorite genre.
4859	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	it looks so delicious, extremely fatty I think, but looks amazing.
4860	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	If you think its animal cruelty for humans to cook and eat the chicken and the egg at the same time, remember chickens eat their own eggs if they needed more nutrients.
4861	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	I was hoping and thinking they’d show us how it’s made....

4865	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	I wonder how they're doing during the pandemic. I hope they survive long enough for me to get the chance to visit.

4867	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	I never knew that Japanese had so much free time and waiting over an hour just for a meal.
4868	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	He used some kind of sauce while cooking the chicken (may be BBQ with soya sauce) And pour the egg thin a circular motion
4869	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	Someone to me: what came first, the chicken or the egg? Me, an intellectual: they came together.........in my stomach

4872	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	I hope his business is not failing during this pandemic
4873	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	Wait isn’t this just an omelet???
4874	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	If you don’t know which comes first, might as well cook both.

4884	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	"To everyone who isn't aware ot this, the chicken egg isn't the ""baby chick"", it's the period of the hen. Like how we women bleed, they too have their period in another form. It's an egg cell that women have. If the hen gets pregnant, the yellow yoke (which consists of a nutritional-dense substance) will become one with the sperm and a zygote is created. This zygote harbors the baby chick..."

4922	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	Just know that people have googled oyakodon for entirely different reasons.
4923	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	It looks to me that the egg on the bottom is cooked but raw on top.
4924	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	I absolutely love people who have this kind of pride in their work. They have a vision and a desire for quality over profits.

4925	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	Is anyone concern with the greas?

4932	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	Fact: The watery substance is not oil; it is a stock-based broth.
4933	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	with that disgusting kitchen you would be fired in eu
4934	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	So if I’m seeing this correctly, you cook the chicken in a small saucepan, then you mix two raw eggs in a separate bowl. You poor that into the sauce pan, then it becomes one big scrambled egg pancake. You then slide it onto the rice, one piece. That looks good.
4935	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	I have been there and tried it. Really good to be honest. A must try if you are in tokyo.

It's a really precious feeling that you cannot express to yourself because it is so delicious. It is worth to fall in line for about an hour. But I knew something is wrong. ""Wish the restaurant stay 50, 100 or 200 years more"" The restaurant might be in danger because there's no kids, teenagers or young adults to eat it. Mostly elders.

4956	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	I'm wondering. In the perfect omelette rice, the omelette gets sliced open, and eggs fall out, yet they look uncooked. In here, the eggs look unfinished aswell. Am I misunderstanding something here?
4957	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	what's that brown liquid before he pour the egg

4963	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	And for the people go politically on Japan's decreasing population and being anti immigrants please get this..... In my perspective being a homogenous country will be more harder to accept other people because of the fear of cultural invasion. Yes more immigrants will be more population but what if those people bring their own culture in to Japan and making it in their own playground? In Europe their is already culture issue between Christianity and Islam. THAT IS THE MAIN REASON JAPAN DISLIKE.
4964	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	So it's literally rice, chicken, and eggs...?
4965	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	How does it feel to be cooked in the blood of your own children
4966	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	When i paused the video right when he puts the bitten egg to the chicken. I see some large amount of oil

4971	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	Looks delicious! But is that oil? Maybe a little bit too much, I mean it will probably taste so much better but it's not really healthy
4972	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	is the egg raw or just runny?
4973	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	They bathe the chicken in her own children. Humans are savage.

4975	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	some fun fact, Oyakodon is also a slang for threesome with mother and daughter.
4976	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	LOL HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA .In Malaysia,we made the chicken and egg for ourselves at home... pretty much everyday and it is called telur bistik... C'mon man You can't be serious..... the chicken and egg is a normal dish in our country..You can pretty much find it all over Malaysia
4977	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	It's rice, soy sauce, eggs, chicken and chives.. Does there really need to be a deep philosophy about the relationship between a parent and child behind it?
4978	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	why don't you just make it yourself
4979	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2QCvORjBYk	In other news, the dish, which goes by the name oyakodan, refers to mother and child. The term oyakodon can be applied to any kind of sexual activity including both the mother and usually daughter, and some other third party. In addition, the term bukkake means to splash, which is why it can describe the act of ejaculating on an individual and a certain preparation of udon noodles, known as bukkake udon. Cheers!!!!!

5002	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Chapati is Indian
5003	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	It's more like 'paratha' stuffed bread from India.
5004	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Italians , hear me up , let it pass this time , he is a great guy , thank you.
5005	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	In malaysia we have same dish like this. Its call martabak. Influence arabic cabab with roti prata fusion..

5007	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Shit looks gross
5008	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Actually in Malaysia & Indonesia, it might called Murtabak/ Martabak
5009	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I like how he used Indian words like chapatti and masala haha
5010	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	"Mark Wien's didn't make his signature ""mmm"" face when he tried this type of pizza. But to be fair, I don't think he ate this chef's version of it"
5011	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	*For the confused ones:* 1:16 That’s not a banana. It’s a ripped plantain. It’s all over tropical/subtropical climates like, Africa, the Caribbean, Hawaii, many other parts of the American continent and all around the world. The flavor is sweet. In Puerto Rico we use it for Amarillos (fried ripped plantain, bifongo (a mofongo that contains sweet plantain) and many others applications.
5012	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This is cultural appropriation
5013	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Its a tradition to watch this once in a while.
5014	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	That's not pizza it's shit
5015	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	yeah that's not pizza.
5016	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	call me a pizza purist all you want, i just don’t want my cuisine being turned into a something that you can just change and act like it’s better than the original. you change it, you don’t get to call it pizza. sorry. no matter what you do pizza is an italian dish with hundreds of years of history. we don’t want our food being associated with another version, no matter how could people claim it is. edit:i’m sure this is good, but it is not pizza. it is a completely different dish.
5017	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	"""Same-same"" ""Yum-yummy"" ""Tum-tum"" ""Chop-chop"" This man is too pure for this world"
5018	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	It’s a stuffed paratha.
5019	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	it looks tasty but im telling you it is not pizza
5020	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	There’s literally nothing in common with normal pizza. Just because you call is something doesn’t make it so? That’s like me making lasagna with beef and calling it enchiladas just because there’s beef in some of those too
5021	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Well, at least he will put Pinapple on sweeter variants together with Nutella and fruits. Unlike those western barbarians who put them with cheese and peperoni
5022	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Yup I heard you but still that's not a pizza
5023	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	thats like calling a donut a pizza, it may be good, but it's not a pizza. it is its own thing.
5024	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	In my opinion there is a big misunderstanding about the idea that Italians have of food. As an Italian, I don't need an invitation to open my mind about Zanzibar pizza, simply because I know that if a food is prepared with care and love, choosing local products, and cooking on the spot, the result will surely be good. The problem is that we Italians give food meanings that go beyond simple nourishment (I don't think we are the only ones, anyway): for us food is linked to family, socialization and hospitality, so if one reinterprets the pizza is fine (although he might call it chapati), if he tells me mine sucks compared to yours, well that's a little offensive.
5025	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	It isnt pizza. Period. Im sure it tastes hella good, but it aint pizza.
5026	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I was scared the comment section is going to be full of angry pizza purists but I'm happy that people are actually appreciating the wholesomeness.
5027	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Rip great big story
5028	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I think this dish looks good and should have its own name instead of pizza.
5029	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This shit , coming from an italian

5032	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	i hate how he says “open your mind” for a new type of pizza but he has no clue about anything pizza

5127	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Same-same! but.. different! - the interview hahaha
5128	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Do not let any Italian person watch this! Also if there is a zanzibar taco, block Mexico from that video too!
5129	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	"that is not pizza, it is pretty similar to my country local dish called ""martabak"" and the dish wasn't pizza."
5130	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I'm sure it's delicious, but it's not pizza...like at all. Flatbread with stuff on it isn't automatically pizza ffs.
5131	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Dude, that's Martabak
5132	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Italian pizza is actually just italian pie *fight me*
5133	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I am sorry my friend, that is martabak at best, not pizza. But go ahead if you really want to call it pizza.
5134	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Sultan of oman life on Zanzibar now 😋
5135	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This is more like martabak?mutabak? What do you call it outside Indonesia?
5136	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This guy is simple too nice and happy to be angry at LoL good luck with your business and an hug from Italy!
5137	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	"""Zanzibar pizza is the best in the world"" I can already hear thousand of Italian chef screaming from here"
5138	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This is very similar to 'PUPUSAS' from El Salvador.
5139	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This is similar to Indonesian/Malaysian/Singaporean Martabak...
5140	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This what u call martabak by melayu people lol
5141	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This is not pizza. The terms African and pizza should never be used in the same sentence
5142	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This is not pizza. Pizza is sauce, cheese, and dough, that's it.
5143	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Looks like a Salvadorian Papusa...
5144	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	That's not Pizza, That's Martabak Search it
5145	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Freddie mercury had it good until age 19
5146	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This isn't pizza I'm sorry but that is the truth.
5147	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	"WE CALL IT ""MURTABAK"" IN MALAYSIA. 😅"
5148	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	But is it really dough?
5149	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I could listen to him speak all day
5150	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Zanzibar... I always reference Billy Joel when I hear the name. I love that place.
5151	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	It's like murtabak from malaysia/indonesia
5152	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	"""same-same, but different"" this guy has a nice sense of humor lol"
5153	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Yum, we need this in the west
5154	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Is it really dough?
5155	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	More like paratha than pizza though. Common in Middle East and Southeast Asia
5156	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	:30 “same same but different” The interview reference 🤔
5157	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	zanzibar is a adult entertainment nightclub in downtown Toronto. XD i pass by it every time i go there. lol. Das some delicious food though.
5158	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	not pizza
5159	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I guess if he can cal that a pizza I can take whatever food and say the same, for example ohh this is not a hamburger this is Nigerian pizza, like bruhh
5160	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	0:27 Uhh... one question what are sneakers Mango
5161	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	yeaaaaah..... not pizza.
5162	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	It looks good but the bread is fried, not baked, so it's more of a Chinese pancake or a French crepe, not a pizza.
5163	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	1:16 Damn, African bananas are HUGE.
5164	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	That's stuffed parotta🤣😂🤣😂 in South India...
5165	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Hmmm, pizza? You should see the “pizza” I make with tortillas, seasoned ground beef, shredded cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, and cilantro. You top the tortilla with all those toppings and fold it in half rather than cut it. Excellent pizza. Especially if you’re in the mood for tacos but don’t have the ingredients. Next week, the hamburger buns, and meat patty, topped with cheese, pickles, and onion...pizza.
5166	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I CAN'T COOK IT BUT I'LL ORDER IT FROM ZANZIBAR!!!!
5167	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Murtabak. That's what it's called.
5168	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Thought we don't call it Zanzibar anymore?
5169	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I was expecting he'll put cinnamon and cloves somewhere in it.
5170	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	"It's more like ""roti canai"". Or whatever u call it in English or in your language. This guy shouldn't call it as pizza"
5171	171	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	So an Indo-zanzibar pizza ?
5172	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Is it really dough?
5173	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Stuffed pizza?! It's more over an indian parath , so it's an idea taken from our indian paratha!!. 👍👍👍 nice I think I won't call it a zanzibar pizza ; I would called it a zanzibar paratha.
5174	174	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	That's not pizza. I'm not saying it's bad, it looks quite nice but it's not pizza. It needs a new name.
5175	175	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I have no idea what valid justification there could possibly be for calling any round open-faced sandwich pizza. Not everything with a slight superficial resemblance to pizza is pizza. But if Italians are willing to accept pizza bianca as pizza, which is simply bread with nothing on it, then anything can be called a pizza. You don't need any ingredient, not even bread. I guess pizza in the loosest sense really is just an open-faced sandwich of any type. And then as you move to a stricter definition you get closer and closer to traditional pizza, to a pizza margherita. I love and sometimes make Neapolitan pizza but I like looser pizza styles as well and can even enjoy weird borderline pizzas like a Zanzibar pizza of fresh fruit on an unleavened flatbread. I'd try it! This was a perfect subject for a two and half minute Great Big Story video.
5176	176	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I mean, you can’t name something pizza just because they got toppings on a bread-like stuff, and compare it to the real pizza. That’s just brutal. Maybe give it another awesome name?
5177	177	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Rip Freddie Mercury 🏁🙏💙
5178	178	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	As Italian I can say I kinda admire him, that's a whole new thing! Interesting!
5179	179	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	"0:27 can I please have a ""chess"" Nutella 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣lmfao"
5180	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Who else is here from Freddie Mercury
5181	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	That is not pizza. It looks good, but it's not pizza in any way at all
5182	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Good but I still prefer Italian one
5183	183	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Chapati and Masala?? dude.. that ain't Zanzibar! That 200% Indian!!
5184	184	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I think David Livingstone missed this 🍕
5185	185	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	GREY FOX, I THOUGHT YOU DIED IN ZANZIBAR!
5186	186	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	no matter how many times you call it a pizza, its still not a pizza.
5187	187	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	it s ok and very cool that he's doing his thing but just don t call it pizza, i's not a pizza
5188	188	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	This is not pizza
5189	189	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	"In Indonesia, they call it ""martabak telor"""
5190	190	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Yeah okay I bet this is tasty but it ain't no pizza
5191	191	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	We have the similar dish in Malaysia and it is called Murtabak
5192	192	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Humara toh prantha h yeh cheese wala😂
5193	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I have a question. Why is he using hindi words like chapati and masala? I mean, masala is a pretty well known word now but chapati is too Indian for him to know?? I'm confused
5194	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I want one with pineapple.
5195	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Roti dough made like indian prata .... that is a murtabak only with all kinds of food as filling
5196	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Yo it looks just like Indonesian *EGG MARTABAK* 👌👌👌 The taste is superb! That dish is on the pinnacle of late night craving dish 😂

5203	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	Pinapple on a pizza ain’t a pizza that’s it
5204	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	As an Italian, I would prefer to eat zanzibar pizza than american pizza.
5205	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86idhCsmZto	I want to go to Tanzania so bad! This is only fuel on the fire for me

5333	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H29sX40ceMM	She’s so beautiful, down to earth & has a great personality/vibe. Affleck made a huge mistake in everyone’s with a functional brain’s opinion
5334	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H29sX40ceMM	I got to give it to Jennifer.. she is so beautiful inside and out..so down to earth, naturally pretty, smart, sweet, I can go on..a great mother, she really takes care of her kids and I might add great actress too...wow, she is the whole package.. someone really lost out and I may add ummm yeah, and there is no comparison..
5335	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H29sX40ceMM	She looks so incredible if she has had plastic surgery i need the name of her doctor asap. I'm sure its 90% genetics you can see its basically the exact same face from when she was a kid but my gosh!
5336	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H29sX40ceMM	How sad to go from Garner to Lopez. I'm glad Jennifer is doing so well careerwise and being a great mum.
5337	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H29sX40ceMM	She needs to drop her skin care routine
5338	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H29sX40ceMM	You are beautiful turning 50 life goals
5339	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H29sX40ceMM	Affleck really had it all huh. What a shame for him.
5340	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H29sX40ceMM	My god she’s so cute and bubbly ,Affleck made a huge mistake in my opinion.

5348	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	Ellen doesn’t let her finish :( keeps interrupting
5349	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	I am Swedish and just so you know, no one here lives in treehouses with no plumbing. ;)
5350	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	i have said this a million times, I'll say it again ... she should have played Belle not Emma watson, i love Emma watson but Lilly collin looks like Belle and she can actually sing
5351	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	Por que nadie habla del evidente trastorno alimenticio y de dismorfia corporal que tiene esta mujer
5352	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	I can not STAND how Ellen doesn’t even allow someone to finish a sentence before speaking. You’re a literal talk show host. LET YOUR GUESTS TALK.
5353	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	I still can't believe her dad is Phil Collins 😭
5354	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	She is gorgeous and I really like Emily in Paris, I just wish the show stops with the offensive stereotypes about everyone who isn't American.
5355	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	Ellen : What happened in that tree house? Lily : ELLEN ! 😂😅
5356	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	Lily Collins is SO SO PRETTY BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS STUNNING ELEGANT CLASSY AND SO SO ADOREABLE!! She's DEFINITELY 100% A PRINCESS AND A GODDESS!!

5358	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	She is so joyful and happy. Brings good vibes. And her personality is so much like Emily's.
5359	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	Kind of worried for her. In Emily in Paris and here, she looks like she’s lost a lot of weight
5360	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	Lily in Paris is an amazing series ❣️ Love you Emily ❣️
5361	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHv9asERNM0	Lily seems like the sweetest most adorable human being ever ❤ she must be protected at all costs

5373	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	How is it that Salma and Penelope haven’t done a movie together?
5374	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	My god she is gorgeous
5375	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	Looks like Ellen enjoys listening to Penelope's talking, must be her accent 'cause she's smiling all the time. I love her and yes, I'm from Spain too and I'm so proud of her :)
5376	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	My ears are bleeding. All the beauty of Spanish actors go to........ When they try to speak English. My mother tongue is Spanish though I speak English better than all the Spanish actors 🤦‍♀️🤭. It's a question of respect but spanish are hard to.... 🤭
5377	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	We have the same tradition of the grapes in Ecuador Of course we were a colony
5378	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	It is Tom Cruise lost for not being her husband !
5379	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	It’s not a Spanish tradition! It’s a Hispanic tradition, because various Hispanic countries follow this tradition.
5380	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	I find it rude the way Ellen awkwardly cuts her for the break and the end 🤦🏻‍♀️
5381	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	Omg as a mom, the 12 grapes would stresss me outtttt. Do people ever choke on them?
5382	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	What does she says she wanted to be in the spies movie?? The fisher something? I cant understand her
5383	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	Penélope is a beautiful human being ♥

5385	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	Penelope Cruz, from Spain 🇪🇸 and Salma Hayek, from Mexico 🇲🇽 both gorgeous spanish-speaking actresses ❤️😍
5386	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	Penelope and Salma with or without make-up, they are just beautiful. She look like Natalie Portman in quick glance.
5387	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	She’s talks too much
5388	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	I grew up eating 12 grapes at midnite and It symbolizes 12-amazing months in the new year, at least that’s what mom always said,!
5389	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	12 GRAPES! Always one of the best traditions we have here in Spain! :)

5393	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	Was that a rush off at the end??
5394	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	I always loved her american accent. Her relationship with Pedro and the way he always have a role for her.

5397	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	This while interview is giving me wierd vibes. I don't think penelope is comfortable. Is just me?
5398	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	She looks even younger. She is so stunning. Her performance in Volver and Vicky Cristina Barcelona are so memorable.
5399	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	By seeing Penelope Cruz you naturally wanna be extra kind to the human race
5400	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	30 years in business and still did not learned English 🤷🏽‍♀️
5401	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	So nice of Salma to open her home to Penelope, not shocked though because that is how we are in our culture. The more the merrier. ☺️
5402	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_cXQ7Agz4	There's something heart-warming and magical knowing Penelope and Salma are close friends, it's like finding out Rihanna and Beyonce are best friends or Messi and Ronaldo

5406	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	She's the best at parenting among them. She seems sweet but a disciplinarian
5407	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	"""What is a warning your are going to give to someone about to have kids?"" The real answer: Make sure to hire a nanny that your boyfriend won't be attracted to."
5408	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	I like Khloe, but her face and the makeup don’t look good. She needs to show off her face without all of it on….I’m sure she would look just as pretty!
5409	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	Totally unrecognizable. I dont know about her parenting skills but i mean she changed her entire face just to fit in. So this means she will teach her kids the same and not be themselves?
5410	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	0:47 No need. Kendell already answered that question on the late late show 😆
5411	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	I honesty think that Khloe is the best at parenting in her family
5412	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	Life is plastic it’s fantastic
5413	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	The Karshadians PR efforts to distance themselves from Travis Scott is really working.
5414	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	Shes beautiful but she somehow looks a little bit different
5415	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	she’s soo tan
5416	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	Omg her face :(

5418	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtftQFxyzIQ	I love that khloé's personality never changed.

5423	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	The wallet in the fridge was for cooling down your finances Steve 😂😂
5424	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	Putting my wallet in the fridge is something I would do when high.
5425	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	I put my phone in the fridge and the cucumber in my ear thinking that its the phone so i can understand what steve is talking about 🤣🤣🤣yes Sir i lost my mind 👍👍👍
5426	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	can someone explain if the show is over or not because they still put new videos on yt? Im not from US so i dont really get it
5427	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	Aww man I miss the Steve Harvey Show soo much!!! They should never have taken it off 🤨! I don’t watch that other show. Being Steve back!!
5428	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	Steve is black dr phil
5429	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	Steve gave his audience more than a talk show. He gave them a stand up also. Great stuff.
5430	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	LOL, yep. I was so tired one evening, I put my cell phone, my keys and my wallet in the refrigerator. I have no idea why, but it must've seemed like a good idea at the time.
5431	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	Hell one time I pulled off without my gas! WTH Story of a single mother, full time student and worker at the time. 😂😂😂
5432	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	Aga home and ma wallet is in the refrigerator 🤣🤣🤣
5433	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	In which state is this show?
5434	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	Who else loves Steve I’m gifting my next 50 subscribers!!!!
5435	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBn6kcbC0U8	JESUS CHRIST LOVE'S YOU.
5436	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	It’s funny how Steve just automatically made it her issue, something she is doing wrong.......instead he should have said something about the men who aren’t able to match HER frequency . It’s not always the woman’s fault....sorry if men need to feel “needed” but there are women who are strong and don’t always need a hero. It doesn’t mean she is cold or mean , it just means that she is used to handling life on her own - and you can be soft handling life alone. Why are men scared of strong , independent women? That’s the real question
5437	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	She needs to be asking God.
5438	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	"I would never take this advice ""men wanna be the hero"" really smdh."
5439	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	It's the black woman curse. It doesn't matter what you do as a black woman, you can be beautiful, exotic, kind, educated, independent, have a good career, be a good Christian etc and will still be overlooked and not wanted... (I'm a black woman btw)
5440	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	Live your life honey. It’s ok to be single. Spend all the change on yourself only. Once you’re in a relationship, you’d wish you were back where you’re at now. Sex...ehh not missing out on anything either
5441	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	"What's so wrong with being single? I had a great happy time when I was single. I published my 1st book, I exercised often, improved my cooking skills, and more. I had a great time working on ""Me."" I never understand why people hate being single so much."
5442	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	She doesn't need to change her frequency. A man who matches hers will see the strength in her and won't feel intimidated. It's not very common that women are comfortable in solitude so a man may see her as a challenge because she found happiness within herself and doesn't require validation from others. Her status is elevated, so it will take a special man to understand her.
5443	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	I dont think Alpha is the correct term. I would use the word Independent.
5444	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	Im single too.. no woman gives me a chance.. ive given up on women and relationships
5445	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	Where are these knight and Shinning Armours?
5446	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	"A good woman is a woman that is happy as a single woman. They make the best girlfriends. As long as this woman has a good attitude, there is nothing wrong with her. So far, she said the men she is dating say they want her to ""play games"", and that she is not in ""need"". A man that wants to play games or that needs to save someone is an insecure man and is a man that isn't ready for a relationship. This woman is doing well. There just aren't very many guys out there that are as ready for a healthy relationship as she is."

I don't mind hero's and I don't mind making people life better but I am not a doormat and I don't let anyone waste my time or play games 🎮 with me. If mf's don't want to date me for that then that's their lack of maturity not mine.

5463	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	She like 90 percent of Edumicated I don't need no man I'm good by myself BW need to stay single for life. You married yourself. An alpha female is best left to herself. There's no good future with one for a man about being anything in his life. Real men need a woman that can submit to him as the lead in the home. Most BW go for themselves and careers because they don't want a man early in their development as young girls. It's too late to wait till you are too old (26 and up) to start thinking about being anything more than a side chick for 99 percent of them.
5464	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	I think the underlying problem is (& I could be wrong, who knows 🤷🏽‍♀️) is that she was/has been single for sooo long that like she said, she got used to it. She got used to the idea that MAYBE her being single is her destiny & therefore she lost hope in finding a mate. That’s kinda how I’ve been feeling too. So that feeling rubs off on guys who maybe do approach her & are either scared/turned off eventually. She just needs to rewire her mindset & believe that she is deserving of love & that it will happen one day. It may sound cliche, but it’s the truth. Same advice I try to tell myself daily 🙏🏽❤️

5497	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	Here's (again) the unasked question: does she want to be in a relationship, or or she comfortble being single and wants to know if it's OK? Steve (and many others, I'd wager) assume that she wants to be in one and just can't 'get out of her own way' and be more personable or receptive, instead of contemplating the that she was just looking for validation regarding her choice to be single. Being in a relationship, or not being in one are both valid choices, and Steve (along with other talk show hosts, advice columnists, and people in general) should entertain both when dispensing with advice/wisdom.
5498	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9J4F7nAEI	I was exactly like this just a years ago: going on dates but not really needing anyone in my life. Until one day BOOM: I matched with a man, who made me want to adjust my life and make space for him. Online dating is great! You just need to remember that every date is a different story. And don't change yourself! He wants to be a hero? First he needs to make you trust him.

5528	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	Not that it’s my business but why lay down with someone who you know damn well he ain’t good? I’m confused

This young lady exposed her life to STEVE as a ""new mother"" I'm assuming and all people can say is you should've thought about that BEFORE having a baby??? IT TAKES 2 PEOPLE to have unprotected sex! A societal trends tends to put too much shame on the mother : ( This woman needs some positive vibes, not chastising criticism or derogatory commentary! Steve did/said exactly what a MAN (male figure) should do: Encourage her that everything is going to be ok and looking FORWARD be cautious of the character of an individual you have ANY interest in. TO THE YOUNG LADY ; God bless you and I pray your journey of motherhood brings abundance, much joy and prosperity (as I have received the same with me and my children)"

5538	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	A whole family of single moms lol 😅 Gonna have to disagree with Steve on this one
5539	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	The black family unit is so broken and in such a destructive spiral 😔. No father so she has a baby without the father around. Good advice from Steve. He saw what she was and why she was in that situation.

5542	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	I don't blame her for seeking out guidance to finding a father figure for her daughter... because at the end of the day she's going to need a man that's going to be the stability, security, and comfortability in her daughter's life and the father of her child probably cannot be the provider, protector, and caretaker he needs to be for his daughter (she feels) because at the end of the day he is the father of their child and if he can't be all those things to the mother of their child it's impossible for him to be a good father to their child... can't have one piece or 1/4 of a whole from a man... because in the end they still have to merge a gap for each other to be the best parents they can be for their daughter... (Hopefully, they can be that for each other for the sake of their own personal lives and their daughter) I really wish people would stop saying he would make a lousy husband but a good father... no disrespect to Steve... but for how long is that gonna last and a good rule of thumb is if he was only good to you for a month or worst a week? That's how long he's gonna be for your child.. harsh truth... but it's true.. he's either going to make excuses for not being there or simply run! #js you need a whole man, husband, and father for you and your child to be all those things I've mentioned previously to your child... that's facts, that's reality, and why wouldn't any woman and of course likewise any man want that for their lives and the lives of their current children or future children... I know I do... Steve is right about one thing God doesn't make mistakes... and I pray she holds out for her future husband because he's not only going to be an amazing man and husband for her but an amazing father for her child as well... no worries sister we all made mistakes in our lives some were just hardcore lessons and there was nothing what a little healing can do and some resulted to blessings and I am speaking about the child only here... but the mistake of being with a man whom was bad from the beginning is on her part... but God has a way if we let him and follow him first and foremost of restoring, healing, and making us whole again so in his perfect timing and will he'll allow us to be with the man that was right all along and he'll be good to you and for you from start to finish... no doubts... #dearfuturehusband #dearfuturehusbanddailyprayers #thatsjustme
5543	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	Stop putting the horse before the carriage then this conversation will be diminished.
5544	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	Ok I get you shouldn't take kids away from the father because he needs to be there. But what about the ones who have every opportunity to be in his kids life decides he doesn't want to be responsible but just wants to be acknowledged (basically a active deadbeat) if that makes sense
5545	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	I agree with Steve that a man teaches his daughter how other men should treat her but if he's not a great man to the woman in his life I believe it limits how great of a father he can be. The way a man treats the woman in his life is directly teaching the daughter how a man should treat her just as much. There are two factors and removing one is limiting to the daughter.
5546	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	If you were raised without a man in your life and you're so concerned why have a baby and put that kid through the same cycle. Don't have a one stand and expect he will be man enough when you get pregnant by him. Best of luck in your next man though.
5547	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	He May Not Be A Great Man To You,He May Not Be A Good Mate but That don't mean He Can't Be A Great Father..... Well said Steve 👏.
5548	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	He was on point except for the having kids outta wedlock not being a serious issue.
5549	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB7H3odA0zI	She is looking for another man to raise another man's child, well, in that relationship the mother will always put the child before the new man or men, so best if the child's father in kept in the equation. My friends and myself, would not date a single mum as it is an uncertain relationship to be honest about matters.

5562	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I just wish you'd prideful men would LISTEN!
5563	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	“Church” is prolly code for the club
5564	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Steve is just rude!😭😂 That's a handsome young man come on
5565	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Kinda messed up how he just insulted the man like that on TV.
5566	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	You can tell he's controlling but it hides under the quiet, shy demeanor.
5567	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I agree that the man needs loosen up and not be controlling, and the lady is beautiful. But I don't agree that looks necessarily amount to hitting the jackpot. There are some extremely attractive people who have nothing to offer in a relationship. Lastly, Steve was rude to imply that the man couldn't do any better with his looks. That shouldn't even have come up.
5568	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	"Steve just called a bunch of those guys ugly 😂 ""look at her, now look at him.. JACKPOT!"" 🤦🏽‍♀️😂🤣"
5569	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Call me crazy but I don't trust controlling men. It is like they don't even trust themselves so that's why they also don't trust their partners.
5570	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I rather go to marriage counseling than be publicly humiliated on national television
5571	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	So what are we all supposed to do without Ask Steve on youtube??? I need this humor and wisdom before I go to sleep.
5572	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Men don't seem to know much about spiritual leadership, but they sure know a lot about hurtful domination!
5573	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I love Steve but he kisses women's ass too much. Sorry but my wife is very smart and very confident. So confident in fact that she is not threatened that I dont follow her every whim. She does not run our house. We do.
5574	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Steve thank you for keeping it Real these guys now days think they are the PRIZE.😒 YOUR WIFE IS YOUR FAVOUR!!!!!💁🏽‍♀️
5575	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Ok... but the real question is: Who’s on this comment section is single? I’m just trying to shoot my shots... lol
5576	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Steve humbled his behind allllll the way down hahaha
5577	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I am sorry Steve but it's your wife that hits jackpot!
5578	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	"They BOTH hit the ""jackpot"". They look better TOGETHER. Alone...they BOTH drop in value. She seems like a good woman...he seems like a good man, who just needs to understand marriage is a partnership...not a dictatorship."
5579	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Aww I didn't think that guy was bad looking. With braces and better posture, he could turn heads. I love that Steve adds humor to tough situations, but I just wish he wouldn't talk about people. The best comedians only talk about themselves and people they know personally, not innocent members in the audience. This reminds me of when people used to duck in their seats at comedy shows way back in the day in order to avoid being singled out and roasted by the comedian on stage.
5580	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	"""You ain't going to get no finer chick than this right here, not you!"" Steve!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
5581	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	"True he's not going to get ""no fine-er chick"" then that one. A start man knows what he's got before it gone."
5582	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Yeah Steve hit the jackpot 3 times. Must not mean nothing.
5583	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	That's a red flag for abuse. Trying to control when she's home and not, and what she does with her daughter (assuming the daughter isn't his from her wording)... Nope. Partners should set boundaries that they're both comfortable with, but controlling is a whole 'nother thing.
5584	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Is his show really cancelled 😥...I love this man and this show
5585	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	He's too young & trying to be controlling. House stuff I get, but her life...no.
5586	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	She’s not out of his league! What is Steve talking about?
5587	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Honestly steve is only one that hit jackpot, but we all know its cause he has money.lol. All the other couples hit jackpot together.
5588	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I don't get it....u both never knew each other well enough before u exchanged vows....I'm sure he was like this before she said I do !
5589	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Why in God's name he would want her to ease up with church, he gotta be stupid
5590	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Yep, this is why i'll never get married.
5591	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Evry woman on hey steve: how do i get my man to do what i want
5592	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I am going to go a bit against the grain here. I think she should not spend as much time at church. Ministry starts at home and if he feels like she is spending too much time at church, she needs to pray about it and step back a bit. Learn how to say no. Now if he is saying no church or no activities at all, there is where the problem lies. He does need to give way a bit more.
5593	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	A man is supposed to be the head of the household. She needs to step back, if she don’t want to, then dump her. She’s tryna control everything
5594	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Steve is right. And his wife Marjorie is classy and beautiful.
5595	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I love how Steve does that! He points out the fact the the woman is the prize!!!
5596	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Ugh Steve. You made this about looks when there is clearly a bigger issue at hand. I pray for this young beautiful couple. May they seek proper counsel some day.
5597	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	It’s not what you say, it’s HOW you say it 🤣😂 “out of your league”
5598	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I almost felt bad for the poor guy but he needed to be taken down a peg or two.
5599	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Their looks match, both look good. And if he gives in to her nagging she'll eventually resent him as a weak man. Dead bedrooms start that way.
5600	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	My husband let’s me control everything and ppl think I’m a dictator but, he loves it and he consults me on everything.
5601	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Sad situation. He’s not a bad looking brother. Steve relax!
5602	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Controlling man. Won't end well with that.
5603	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Steve Harvey can be completely unrealistic at times, that dude is a handsome man and I can tell u I have seen plenty of men that look completely busted up with women who are at least 3 to 4 times more attractive than she is lmao.
5604	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Steve you called the man ugly to his face lol. Outta his league. Sheesh that's tough
5605	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	For me is the other way round she hits the jackpot
5606	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Steve low key said dude was ugly 🤦🏽‍♂️
5607	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I love your commitment to schooling men on properly respecting women.
5608	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	"He just dissed that man right out! ""Not you!"" 😂😂😩"
5609	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	She is gorgeous!! Too bad she married this fool. Did he grow up like that
5610	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Steve on this jackpot bullsht! Steve didn't hit the jackpot nahh, its Steve wife who hit the jackpot. You all need to stop allowing people to telling you bullsht. A jackpot bring? Joy. Now if they get divorce, which one will get joy: •steve? OR •wife of Steve?
5611	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Damn Steve insult and advice..😂😶
5612	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Beautiful young couple I wish them a successful marriage 😍😍
5613	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Ok guys, it seems everyone has been misinterpreting what's happening. What we see here is a guy with some controlling issues and it has driven her to the point that she's seeking advice. Marriage is a partnership and both parties share and relinquishes control. It is where both persons share their resources and knowledge to make the right decisions and the other can pick up the slack if needs be. Marriage should not be a form of oppression where it seems like she's living with her parents again telling her what she can or cannot do. He clearly has some issues he needs to address because at some point she might eventually leave him. He has to remember she's her own person and he married her because of who she was. Just got to cooperate. Don't steal her freedom of choice.
5614	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	"Okay Steve ""let her be smart"", yes then let her go and work since she want to be smart, talking about ""volunteering at the church"" you know well them boys at church are trying to pull your draws down, that poor boy working his assoff and cannot get a cook meal because ""im at the church volunteering for Jesus"" hmmm. You cannot compare yourself with millionaire Steve, bcus not every cat have 9lives. Boy listen: if you allow that woman to run your ship on your $10-$15 per hour job she will abandon. I think the boy didn't get to say what he wanted to say because Steve fancy her too much: •my wife is lazy. •i work $15ph and shes using to support the church. •i think she should be at home more and spend the money on us NOT at the church making the pastor richer. •she is very smart but all she wants to do is vulenteer at the church. •steve i think she cheating on me with someone at the church."
5615	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Now to all men, when you hit the Jackpot 🎰 try not to be over protective and let the woman lead sometimes...hey my opinion and I’m still waiting to hit the jackpot 😉
5616	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	When he said “look at my wife marjorie, and then look at me”😂
5617	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Steve, somehow you have been given a touch of King Solomon! You have been blessed! : )
5618	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	"🤣""...not you!"" The best, Steve!"
5619	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	The man is the head of the house, so the bulk of responsibility falls on him. The wife is supposed to be the helpmate. Normally I go with Steve, but I can’t ride with him on this. As long as he considers her thoughts, I think he’s doing fine leading.
5620	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I thought dude was Dennis Smith Jr for a second 😂
5621	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I sense a little timidity on her part! He sopposed to go with her church! God is the foundation of every marriage, also there has to be some sought of balance on her part.. but hd cant try to dictate to her she should be home more! When maybe she is trying to find solace by going to church in the first place..
5622	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	let female lead a relationship, and they will lead you off a cliff. females hate to lead, they are not attracted to that.
5623	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Whats up with that coller? YEEESH!
5624	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	I agree with your man , home is better than church , nothing good comes from church.
5625	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	Yay Steve Harvey is back on Sundays
5626	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSEna5vubto	"2 Corinthians 8: 9 "" For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich."""
5627	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZHakKYcuQ	Omg Steve THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HER. I LOVE this girl. 💜

5630	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZHakKYcuQ	She needs to go on the VOICE or IDOL ASAP
5631	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZHakKYcuQ	Don't give that girl an Oscar yet. Give that girl a Grammy already.
5632	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZHakKYcuQ	I wish Pink just Pop up in Steve Show.. to surprise her

5635	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZHakKYcuQ	Sound damn good but she don't look like no 15 yrs old
5636	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZHakKYcuQ	Sounds good... must be that Canadian air !!

5644	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	It’s 2030 and Charlie still talks about his perfect pitch in every interview
5645	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I l him
5646	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Oh my god Jim let him finish his sentences
5647	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I'm so sick of Talk Show hosts not letting people talk! He interrupted him like 40 times
5648	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	This is so annoying
5649	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	U fell off
5650	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I can't believe he's not completely sick of proving his perfect pitch by now. What a gracious dude
5651	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I’m almost 1000% positive he’s on the spectrum. He truly is a genius.
5652	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie is so awkward, it makes me feel better about myself ❤️
5653	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	😂👏🏿👏🏿 smartypants!
5654	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I love Charlie Puth and I’m so glad he’s back. He seems happier this time around too.
5655	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie’s aesthetic is amazing!
5656	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Our charlie ❤️
5657	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I know Charlie must be so annoyed always having to talk about his perfect pitch in every interview. I think he was being lowkey slick when he was pointing out that the desk is brown and the paper is white. Cuz that's basically what they're asking him to do by demonstrating the pitches.
5658	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I love me some Charlie!!!!!
5659	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He’s very awkward
5660	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	This guy just raised the bar for young artists
5661	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Yellow rep squad lookin good
5662	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I love Jimmy’s interviewing style he is respectful but doesn’t suck up to people..... Charlie is such a talent and his voice is incredible!
5663	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I’m sure Charlie is tired of demonstrating his perfect pitch every interview he does 😂😂😂
5664	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	jimmy kimmel aint as funny as he used to be imo
5665	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I am considering myself as old for general tiktok user and yes I do know Charlie before he is in tiktok and when I saw him on tiktok, I thought he was a different person 555 He is dopee
5666	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I loove him , he’s such a goof 😂😂😂😂😂😂
5667	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Love him
5668	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	So what about the car horn
5669	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Jimmy farts. Charlie thats a E2
5670	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	This guys is the greatest musician alive
5671	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Your security crew better stop abusing their power to the greatest dentist of all time. Jimble Kimble WISHED he had the charisma of Jimmy Lee. Get him on your show and stop wasting time making up lies about people. You don’t OWN public property, clown.
5672	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Amazing that he knows the notes and pitch on everything and can mimic it.
5673	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I clicked this one already anticipating that I'm gonna hear about perfect pitch 😂 And I was right 🙂
5674	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Love that he held the album upsidedown
5675	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie is still awkward. Cute
5676	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I have a feeling that he isn't aware at how cool this actually makes him lol He is a total genius to me. I've watched most of his tiktoks videos and yet I'm still blown away by this video when he made the phone vibrating sound lol😭
5677	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He is weirdly awesome man!!
5678	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	LOVE YOU CHARLIE PUTH! ♥️✌️
5679	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	jimmy you fell off when you sold out to the woke left.
5680	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I think it’s funny he had “perfect pitch” but his auto tune songs hurt my ears :) I still watch him lip sync his subway commercial 😂
5681	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	hasnt he gone bit thinner than he was earlier when he came on same show?
5682	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Panties dropped!
5683	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie is; and always will be a musical genius. Musical motherf**king Genius!
5684	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	3:43 keyboard player flexing his ear too 🤣🎹👂👌
5685	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Why is he so red i think he was jogging and came directly into the show
5686	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Jimmy Kimmel is a horrible disgraceful human being.
5687	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Jesus loves you, repent us
5688	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I don’t really get the perfect pitch hype. Literally every decent musician has that because it’s the most normal thing if you play an instrument every day that you know in your head what note will come before you play it and no Jimmy that’s not crazy, just practice 😂
5689	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	is his perfect pitch the only thing there is to his personality?
5690	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	After conan other talk show suckss.
5691	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Everybody is talking about his perfect pitch but no one is talking about his prefect smile 😍
5692	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He's such a musical prodigy can't wait for Charlie to b out♥️
5693	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Talented, but compared to Jimi Hendrix...
5694	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	DO NOT CUT HIS STORY !
5695	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	If underrated was a person.
5696	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He can turn anything into song
5697	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I'm delighted an interviewer has brought up his perfect pitch in a good way. Some of the other times it seemed manufactured and Charlie seemed less at ease but this time he was bringing up examples and stuff. It's lovely to see.
5698	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Cool guy! My aunt had perfect pitch and could do that kind of stuff. Always blew my mind. This guy could immediately identify two notes played simultaneously, which is impressive. Here's a story about Mozart. (Might be apocryphal). When he was 12 years old, he was backstage when his father was conducting an orchestra. As the musicians warmed up before the curtain opened, Mozart walked out into the orchestra and told one of the violinists that his instrument was 1/8 tone sharp. Like, OMG! I have my doubts about that story, because I don't believe a violin can even be tuned to that degree of accuracy, except by accident. You would need some kind of Vernier tuning knob.
5699	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	brooo he off the benzos fr
5700	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Musical nerd 😅😅😅😅

5703	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Everything he does blows up
5704	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Lmao is there a video out there that doesn't have Charlie doing this exact thing? Like we get it already haha! 😅🤦‍♂️

5707	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	This is so stupid,he’s got to go through this everytime. He has perfect pitch,don’t you all know what that is? 🤦🏽‍♂️😁
5708	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	"I'm definitely aging myself here... but I found out about Charlie Puth when he recorded the jingle 🎶""The funniest kid you've ever seen is supermac18"" and supermac played it at the end of his video."
5709	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Loved this interview!!!

5712	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I will never NOT be amazed at the talent of perfect pitch.
5713	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He’s probably so tired of showing everyone his perfect pitch…
5714	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	The CLIMATE CHANGE SCAM is making Billions of dollars💲for Biden, Gore, Soros, Thunberg, Trudeau, Dorsey, Zuckerberg, Turnbull, Rudd, and all the wealthy elites, whilst driving the average persons living standards down. These Democrats want you to be slaves kneeling at the altar of climate change🧎whilst they live like emperors👑
5715	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Anyone else notic Jimmy held the Light Switch cover upside down?
5716	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	KEEP STREAMING LIGHT SWITCH
5717	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Looks like he has a nerdy story for every note he’d hear 😂
5718	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He's a bit quirky. But he's very talented
5719	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	OMG! He's a really funny, cute, handsome & a genius artist!!! CHARLIE PUTH!
5720	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He's so cuteeee
5721	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I wonder if he cares that every time he does an interview his whole life people always ask him to test his perfect pitch lmao
5722	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	It’s fascinating how his brain works 🤯
5723	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Not Jimmy holding the artwork upside down 🤦‍♂️
5724	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	"""the tok""...saves so much time. And to think, in the 1970's my curly hair parted on the side got so much scorn...I was so far ahead of my time"
5725	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Come on Jimmy! Musicians are real people.
5726	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I just love Charlie Puth. What an incredible talent. And he’s pretty darn cute too!
5727	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	It’s so hot that he’s so into music. He lives and breathes music and the way he teaches people… I could listen to him talk about music for hours 😍
5728	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He’s aight
5729	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He’s amazing

5731	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Umm... impressed!
5732	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie got it going on
5733	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie is really clever that was impressive, he knew all the keys but more so he really loves & connects with music. I love that, Charlie’s really cool 💯
5734	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	i used to know a woman who claimed her air conditioner hummed a B flat
5735	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie so cute & good singer. Bless you
5736	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I LOVE LIGHT SWITCH
5737	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie is so adorable! trying to explain how his brain works! 💚❤️💚❤️💚
5738	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Please help me understand why someone claimed to have perfect pitch would would release a song that sounds like it was produced with heavy autotune??!!!
5739	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Even his speaking voice is musical lol
5740	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	"I thought this was gonna be another ""testing his perfect pitch"" video, which would completely useless, bc why would he lose his perfect pitch all out of the sudden. But no, I was surprised how well they managed it to ""test"" it in a not annoying way (as far as I can tell that Charlie wasnt annoyed or smth)"
5741	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He’s gotta be getting annoyed that every interview features perfect pitch 🤣
5742	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I'm 26 I'm playing keyboard from 8 years can i develop perfect pitch 😭😭😰😰🙏🙏
5743	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	TikTok made me a fan. He's a great guy.
5744	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Totally absurd. The way to tell if someone has perfect pitch is basically the opposite. The piano player plays a note at which point the individual determines exactly what note was played. This is repeated several times with different notes. And like every other so-called singer-songwriter on the current agenda, this guy is absolutely mediocre.
5745	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	The A on the glass was a little flat though
5746	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I love how musical nerdy he is. .its so hot and his songs are so incredible.. how long, mother, done for me, attention and light switch is my top songs on my playlist
5747	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Full send
5748	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Tat was so cool that interview!!!
5749	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I continue to be blown away by Charlie Puth's musical skill. He has more musical talent in his pinky than Jimmy Kimmel has comedic talent in his whole body. 😂😂😂
5750	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	"Easter egg: He has worn the same outfit as he did in the ""Left or Right"" (over here) video 👕"
5751	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I love how the light switch album cover is upside down at 0:09
5752	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Ngl, I only clicked this video bc I saw the headline and I’m like “Pfft what a crock. Let’s see how ‘perfect’ he really is.” Now I’m like “Fckn Aye!! The dude’s brilliant!” I’ve never seen anyone with a special skill they could demonstrate as instantly as this. It would take me longer to name a letter or color than it takes him to name a note, and he’s so sure of it, even when it’s 2 notes?!?
5753	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie is that awkwardly smart guy.
5754	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	"When you are a die-hard Charlie fan, somehow how already know what he's gonna say in the interview. Cause when the interview was going on I was like ""Ha I already knew that"" which is of kinda awesome, as you get the vibes that 😎 you are more familiar with the guest than the host. Although being in his 30s he looks so young No doubt he is an absolute gem of the industry Btw his new haircut looks fabulous ❤"
5755	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Whatta Dork I have absolute pitch; relative pitch is more useful. And It’s easier to learn than you think
5756	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	God that song is so bad...
5757	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Such a fun guy! Like, an incredibly talented, dorky, passionate hermit.
5758	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I think he’s too confident for his own good. Music is very deep and the greater the musician the more inadequate he/she feels. Be it Hans Zimmer, Tchaikovsky, or Beethoven…
5759	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I don’t watch this show. I’ll never watch anything involving Jimmy Kimmel as long as he keeps traveling down this corporate government funded “Woke” path. It’s really pathetic. He’s funded by an ever-expanding corporate machine that keeps funding trash like this without any real sizable number of viewers. The YouTube kids that are seeing right through all of this controlled narrative BS are now the big boys as far as ratings go and everyone knows it. It’s time for Jimmy to step down and fade into obscurity, spending the rest of his life wondering why he gave up on his own morals and talents just to keep spouting manipulative narratives for out of touch “elites” who are desperately attempting to maintain control of the populace. Jimmy knows that he’s pathetic, so why do you all keep watching? Ask yourselves that. “Why am I still watching someone like this?” Are you really entertained? Is this a safe space where you somehow believe that media considers your perspective? Or maybe you ask yourself whether or not you’re being manipulated. Is this the world you want to live in? I choose the real world.
5760	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	They didn't look this good in my days of youth
5761	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	he is in his own world its amazing
5762	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He has tons of tons of knowledge in music !
5763	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	more artists should overshare. don’t gatekeep knowledge. let amateurs learn from the best.
5764	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie ❤️❤️❤️
5765	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Omigosh Charlie is adorable! That little blush at the end about being 'uh cool' in school!
5766	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I feel like this perfect pitch bit is so tired. It’s impressive, but it’s all everyone ever says about him 🙄
5767	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	That's so cool. I've known people in my life who have perfect pitch but having a demonstrated that way was really cool. Generally speaking everybody has one sense that is much more acute than the others. Mine is my sense of color. For instance when he said that desk is brown my thought was well no, that's kind of like 50 shades of brown. My daughter's is her sense of smell. She can tell you what brand of cigarettes you were smoking by the smell. My ex-husband was taste. He could taste any dish and tell you exactly all the ingredients in it. Me, I'm like that tastes really good.
5768	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I have that same gift. GOD gets the glory though.
5769	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	You totally ghosted em
5770	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	"I had my doubts about his ""perfect pitch."" Most people who claim to have perfect pitch really only have a highly developed sense of relative pitch. They've memorized a certain pitch in their head & then can name a random pitch relative to the one in their head. But after this demonstration, I'm convinced this guy really does have perfect pitch. It's a weird, rare skill that not even one in a million musicians have."
5771	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	It's somewhat disappointing that people only knows Charlie from Tiktok while I know him since 6 years ago. See You Again, One Call Away, Marvin Gaye and We Don't Talk Anymore are some of his biggest hits. The guy is literally a musical nerd/genius who hears everything and knows the exact note and pitch of it. I enjoyed watching his pre-debut videos making vines and randomly making music with his super curly hair. 😂
5772	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Seems like a nice guy and all, but modern music is terrible, and his songs are no exception. Boring, unoriginal music, cookie-cutter pablum for those with no musical taste. Just like Bieber or nSync or most pop stars, he is attractive, and I guess that's all it takes to get female listeners.
5773	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	So talented and so humble! Such an adorable human being 💚 Go, Charlie! Your new album is going to be amazing
5774	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He was a bit nervous and that was so cute tbh 😍😍
5775	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Chalie Puth: Turns 70 TV Hosts still then: Let's put you to a Perfect Pitch test.
5776	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie is super talented, a genius, his singing is phenomenal. Every single interview he has done so far based on lightswitch, is always fascinating/interesting/ amazing to watch :)
5777	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	He does looks like a new artist This is a new start for us. The fact that his 3rd album is self titled makes a lot of sense. He honestly doesn't even look 30. CHARLIE is going to be amazing
5778	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Apparently it annoys Charlie that people do this, so, I'm surprised he did this not just in rehearsal, but for the live show
5779	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I don't understand why do we have to talk about his perfect pitch. 3:21 you can see his smile fading away when Jimmy mentioned it. I feel so bad for him. I wonder why they didn't ask about the album and what song he's gonna release next.
5780	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Okay AWESOME, very impressive, but then why use frikkin AUTOTUNE on the vocal track for your song? LORDOHOLOROHLORD OH. LORD. WHEN will that stupid-sounding mess go out of style???
5781	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I love how musical nerdy he is. .its so hot and his songs are so incredible.. how long, mother, done for me, attention and light switch is my top songs on my playlist
5782	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Stop shaving the eyebrow
5783	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Not gonna lie I didn't know who Charlie Puth was until this video. The longer I watched the more interested I got in what he has done. Now I'm defiantly going to check out other projects he has been apart of.
5784	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	It's such a shame that with so much talent he has terrible music taste. Imagine if he liked making actual good songs instead of pop mainstream crap.
5785	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I have perfect pitch too, and so does my sister. I think it’s because we started music very young, about 5 years old. Having perfect pitch is good, but having absolute pitch would be a nightmare!
5786	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	The fact that people aren't losing their minds when he correctly states the note of a pen falling into a cup is WILD. The LA crowd is slow!
5787	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	that is amazing.. I heard about perfect pitch but this was a very good example. Thank you.
5788	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Jimmy: They say you have Perfect Pitch... Me: Not againn!!! Poor Charlieee
5789	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	he’s freakin adorable!!! “I’m standing up.” 🤣
5790	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Jimmy holding the Light Switch cover upside down is totally sending me💀
5791	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I love Charlie, but, from the begining the only thing he does is talk about his perfect pitch, its like, okay, we get it
5792	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie looked a bit nervous (like in 0:48 / 7:13) but he was still very funny and joking around. 3:15 Like his 😅😅reaction when being asked about whether ppl on TikTok will get paid as writers 😄😄. 7:21 He innocently felt so relieved it's done and it's cute 🙂.
5793	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	"As someone who ""learned"" music by ear, it's really a curse and much more impressive how much he's achieved"
5794	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	I have relative pitch… can do what Charlie does in terms of identifying the notes, but then singing them back is not always perfect 😅👍🏼
5795	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Charlie’s an absolute genius
5796	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	As a non-puth fan, I can say I'm officially a puth fan 😂
5797	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	That last vibration 🤣🤣
5798	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	What a gift! Perfect pitch indeed! 😀
5799	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	There HAS to be perfect pitch in every interview
5800	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Pete Davidson is better
5801	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Can we talk about how INCREDIBLE Charlie looks I CAN'T with him
5802	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	Not only I'm in love Charlie's music, I'm in love with his deep voice like omg
5803	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw3-k95QkDw	This pony must have more tricks.
5804	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	This is so fake and staged
5805	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	Jimmy, I hope you are well aware that this Goldfish probably died shortly after this - because of you. How stupid (or just cruel) must one be to randomly hand out animals to strangers.
5806	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	How's the son twice as tall as the dad
5807	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	When the “mother” Susan bumped into Fernando and apologized, i knew right away she was the imposter! Lol
5808	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	Seriously, the dude who was way taller than everybody else in his family... no one even gave a thought to the possibility that he could be the stranger?! I know he could just have the freak tall genes in the family, or be adopted, but that's typically not the first thought you think of when playing this game. Dude did not match!
5809	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	I work in epiginetics. This is silly. Brendan might be kin.
5810	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	Jimmy, never give live earthlings as gifts. Those fish don’t deserve to go to someone who didn’t seek them out. I hope they are ok.
5811	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	What's with the white sneakers?
5812	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	"Brendan looked like he wandered in from the ""Guess who's high"" segment!"
5813	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	Brandon work for a Radio station that is a voice.
5814	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	George is a cutie.. and apparently only lives a city away. 🇨🇦
5815	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	Brandon was high didn't take long on that. The shoe store woman I wouldn't have guessed. Knew the girls were sisters
5816	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	He was obviously the one... dark, tall, skinny, and funny looking.😂😅🤣
5817	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	Brendan has a good voice. He sounds like a radio announcer.
5818	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	But the first one was obvious even without Brendon talking. The rest looked so similar.
5819	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	As a Canadian from Calgary, I knew there was no maple and vine. Plus the accent was wrong.
5820	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	And Jimmy is the only one that called that kid Brandon... trying to convince people of BS or is it Let's go Brandon?!?
5821	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	Born in Calgary, grew up in BC. W. C. cities do not generally have streets with those names.
5822	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	Obviously both dead give-aways... I mean the first one the dude completely ruined it, and the second one was a little more subdued, but you could tell when Susan, the last lady, bumped into the guy next to her when they were walking out that her reaction was that of one you would have with a total stranger and not a family member.
5823	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnTp5z4Hfs	Islam is the religion of mercy, tolerance and love

5825	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will and Ryan have a sense of humor that goes over a lot of peoples head, it’s so much funnier because it can be so subtle
5826	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	why will is looking like a homeless man who stoles watches 🤣🤣🤣
5827	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	"So many comments of ""everybody gets the two Jimmy's confused."" And yeah, that Ryan and Will could trade places on either show, and no audience would be disappointed (as a whole audience; surely individuals were somewhat bummed). Clever marketing on the part of all four, esp with varying methods to watch the movies."
5828	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I JUST LOVE THIS MAN!!! Right up there with Robin Williams...
5829	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	“I thought Ryan was coming” Meanwhile on another Jimmy’s talk show: “I thought Will was coming”
5830	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	All the child abusers still at large” in Hollywood apparently, disgusting pigs
5831	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will Ferrell has direct connection with my sense of humor, he doesn't need to do comedy, just by talking and I am already smiling
5832	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Can we just take a moment to admire will's star wars pj pants
5833	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Holy F this was hilarious. 🤣🤣
5834	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I love how they switched on the two Jimmy late shows. So classic; so funny.
5835	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will Ferrell has direct connection with my sense of humor, he doesn't need to do comedy, just by talking and I am already smiling

5837	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Jimmy kümmel is not funny and kinda sucks.
5838	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	“Ryan couldn’t make it” Will said trying to mask a smile. He looked at the tv-host with a deep stare. “Do you like magic Jimmy?” he calmly asked the host.
5839	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Something tells me their both going to do a Movie Together Soon ! 🤷‍♂️Maybe,I.don't Know !.🤔
5840	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I'm only forgiving Will for this because of his fantastic Star Wars pants.
5841	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I liked the 3 eggs
5842	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I’m in denial that the great comedians are getting older. Seeing Will Ferrell with grey hair is insane
5843	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Can will and ryan make w movie plssss that would be one funny movie
5844	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	please will Ferrell do a George bush jr impression
5845	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan Reynolds is naturally hilarious. The last 10 minutes or so he's appears in Hobbs and Shaw, that is the best part of the movie. I sat through the entire movie hating that I payed for a ticket, but that ending Ryan Reynolds shows up in, it made it all worth it. He's in the last 10 minutes and he made the entire movie.
5846	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan Reynolds never acts he’s just himself 😂
5847	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	“Ryan couldn’t make it” Will said trying to mask a smile. He looked at the tv-host with a deep stare. “Do you like magic Jimmy?” he calmly asked the host.
5848	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	He should fill in for the president. Pretty sure he'd do better. That's what's scary 🙈😆
5849	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan and Will showing up to each other's interviews and promoting each other's movies is just SO WHOLESOME honestly. Love them!!
5850	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will did Ryan's impression the whole time.
5851	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will's mismatched PJ are everything
5852	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Antifa 👍🏻
5853	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I like how Will looks like a homeless person like he LITERALLY did just walk down the street. He looks like me on a Sunday when I know I'm not going anywhere or seeing ANYONE.
5854	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I love that the Jimmys didn't seem to actually know this would happen 😂
5855	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Kimmel: how’s blake lively? Will: ahhh well she’s gooood Fallon: how’s your wife blake lively? Ryan: no personal questions Jimmy, but she’s good….the sex is great Gotta love 2 different answers 😂😂
5856	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	everytime i subscribe? i hand to unsubscribe 10 ten times
5857	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Imagine how Will and Ryan talked about to switch shows and how funny this could be. 😂
5858	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan is filling for Will at Fallon coz he lives nearby, Will is filling for Ryan at Kimmel coz he lives nearby. *This is the best trade deal in the history of trade deals*
5859	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	This is truly brilliant. He even came in PJs just to make it look unplanned.
5860	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan said the exact same thing on Jimmy Fallon. “Got a text, running late” They are geniuses to pull this off
5861	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	"Will: I'm so excited for ""Red Notice."" Jimmy: Are you in ""Red Notice?"" Will: I am not."
5862	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell are probably the only two people that could switch places and the people expecting them wouldn’t be disappointed either way 😂
5863	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Wait, Gal Gadot? The chick that sang that one song on the internet.....and then totally got called out? She made it thru that? Lmfao.
5864	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	When answering the questions on Blake and his kids he actually acts just like Ryan
5865	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	The switch for both of them was amazing😂😂😂
5866	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Kimmel handled the switch way better than Fallon did 😂😂🤣.
5867	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	This man is truly one of the greatest comedic genius of our era.. nobody can do his type of humour! Can you imagine anyone else doing Elf or Step Brother? Just can't.
5868	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	"Will: I'm so excited for ""Red Notice."" Jimmy: Are you in ""Red Notice?"" Will: I am not. 😂"
5869	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I have bedsheets from the 70's that are made of the same fabric as Will Ferrell's pants. It's the empire strikes back fabric FYI
5870	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	"Correction: ""Chad Smith Shows Up Instead of Ryan Reynolds"""
5871	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	“I thought Ryan was coming” Meanwhile on another Jimmy’s talk show: “I thought Will was coming”
5872	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Lmao! Amazing marketing by Ryan and Will's team.
5873	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan: Doesn't show up on the Kimmel show, but goes to Fallon instead. Kimmel audience: Baby did a bad, bad thing.
5874	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will went to Jimmy and Ryan went to Jimmy. I don‘t understand what problem there is
5875	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will always likes to make a grand entrance on talk shows, & Ryan is a mastermind at marketing - genius! 🤩🤩🤩
5876	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Would have been WAY funnier if Will said he got the Jimmy’s mixed up. That was the reason why he called on Ryan to be at Fallon, but didn’t want to admit it because he was embarrassed. Lol!
5877	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	GARBAGE PROGRAMMING FOR THE ZOMBIFIED WOKE...
5878	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	love this guy's confidence
5879	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	What happened to the dislike button?
5880	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I love that they were both dressed like they weren't planning on coming on a show that night - Ryan wearing very casual clothes rather than a suit, and Will straight up looking like he just got out of bed and pulled on slippers and a coat like he heard the fire alarm go off.
5881	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will’s outfit with slippers seriously seems like Ryan hit Will up right when Will was takin his trash out and asked if he could fill in
5882	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	"F Jimmy Kimmel but ""Ryan"" was on point"
5883	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	How much of your life do these people have to take away from you, your family bad friends before you turn them OFF! These people helped Biden and Harris get elected and you kiss their A$$e$? Oh, please entertain us and tell the world how lousy we are here in America!
5884	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I'm getting a little tired of pretending like Will Farrell is funny.
5885	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	This whole swapping places thing was an amazing idea!
5886	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	When answering the questions on Blake and his kids he actually acts just like Ryan
5887	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	“You’re on the Jimmy late night show.” “Which one?” “The one where the host’s surname is a consonant, a vowel, two of the same consonants, a vowel, then another consonant.” “Hm”
5888	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Roughly 600 neo-cons who hate JK and refuse to get vaccinated thumbed this one down. Love this clip! 💪💯🤣
5889	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Are both Jimmy's genuinely surprised about Will and Ryan switching or part of the plan
5890	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will should just fill in for everyone
5891	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Compared to Fallons, I like how Kimmel is legit shocked at Wills appearance.
5892	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Why does it feel like Ryan’s marketing company planned this 😂 gold
5893	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	“I don’t need to show you my badge , I have a gun” straight from the police academy handbook!
5894	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will always brings fire…but the pants outdid him!❤️
5895	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	"This is probably Will""s most normal interview but he's interviewing as Ryan."
5896	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Someone in the Marketing department is getting a RAISE! 🤣
5897	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	This was hilarious, i was still expecting Ryan to show up but will is so talented that he can even play a great Ryan Reynolds. Can't wait to see their movie together
5898	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	3 actors who are the exact same people in every single movie they've ever been in
5899	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Has anyone see a similarity between him and President bush “junior” ? Wish he does an impersonation of him, could be hilarious :-)
5900	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	This was actually hilarious. Will isn’t even one of my fav comedians but he nailed this 😂
5901	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will in awe at the sight of shirtless Ryan “WOW, I forgot I looked like that” 😂
5902	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	"This _switcheroo_ assuredly was inspired by the periodic mixups between the ""two Jimmys"" in real life (i.e. off-camera). Of course, this gag would not be workable if one of them went by 'James' and the other went by 'Jimmy'."
5903	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Jimmy looks honestly surprised. I wonder if he really didn't know. I watched Ryan on Fallon and Fallon looks like he knew.
5904	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I love how Will took on Ryan's characteristics
5905	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I love this guy's confidence. Even though Jimmy put him on the spot so many times, he always had a big smile and never afraid to make a fool out of himself.... awesome
5906	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	The real star is Will Ferrell’s pants. I need those Star Wars pants in my life!!!
5907	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Surprise guest changes with complete unpreparedness and improv is actually a great way to mix up the late night genre, also having them do activities clearly intended for the original guest
5908	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Next the Jimmy's should definitely do this. Jimmy Kimmel should be in New York City and Jimmy Fallon should be in Los Angeles at different studios. It would be comedy gold.
5909	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan: Doesn't show up on the Kimmel show, but goes to Fallon instead. Kimmel audience: Baby did a bad, bad thing.
5910	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan reportedly said that he’s not acting anytime soon because he’s tired, I think this is the reason why this happened….
5911	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	That's not Ryan but man whoever this guy is he's funny. He should get his own movie or something because I might actually watch that. Just a joke, calm down.
5912	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	It's hard to tell whether this was Ryan's idea or Will's, and that makes it even more fun. Genius additional free marketing too (which makes me think Ryan did this).
5913	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	This is an Excellent strategy for not giving away spoilers.
5914	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I wasn't sure about Ryan's Fallon interview, but this one made me more convinced that the hosts didn't actually know they had switched, bc jimmy looks genuinely confused
5915	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Honestly he's the greattest comedian actor ever! No matter what he's doing he just want to make us laugh 😆 !
5916	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	“How much time are you spending in the gym?” “Um …thats like a solid 20 minutes!!” 🤣 LMAOOO !! I’d love to see Will n Ryan in a movie soon together!
5917	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I bet this was Ryan''s idea. They have a movie in a year right? So this switcheroo with the Jimmys promotes their current stuff AND the other movie they are working on together. The man has such exceptional ideas when it comes to advertising. I live on the Ryan Reynolds youtube channel.
5918	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I love this kind of Will Ferrel comedy! It’s subtle and witty and just so damn hilarious 🤣
5919	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I might be the only person who just doesn’t find Will funny at all
5920	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Next time on the 2 Jimmy shows: Will Farrell swaps places will Pharell Williams
5921	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will Ferrell is the most brilliant idiot of all time. He's so good 🤣
5922	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan and Will swapping placing on the Jimmys' shows, is like the 4th wall breaking for me
5923	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	how is he so funny
5924	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Man, Will Ferrell is just not funny on the spot. Um ah ah ah um ah *paraphrases Jimmy.
5925	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Unpopular opinion: Will Farrell is funnier as himself than he is in character.
5926	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	"Blake is probably at home watching this like ""I do make oatmeal!"" 😂"
5927	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will has had the same awkward stomach since his snl days...whatever he's doing to maintain that stagnant body is impressive and enviable
5928	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	“Are you in Red Notice!???” “… I am not” No more questions your honour.
5929	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	It almost seems like Jimmy was genuinely suprised
5930	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Imagine if the crowd had sounded really disappointed when Will Ferrell walked on lol
5931	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	It would have been funnier if they just pretended like they got their Jimmies mixed up.
5932	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I'd like to know if this was the writers doing or Ryan and Wills doing lol I'd like to believe Ryan thought it up and Will laughed and said let's fuckin do it.
5933	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I didn’t realize he was wearing Pj’s and slippers until 8min in 😂
5934	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	First he perfects the role of Deadpool and now he does the greatest Will Ferrell impression
5935	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan and Will switched places to be on different Jimmys' show. Lmao I love them!
5936	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	gotta say.. fallon improvised better and it flowed better
5937	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	This is gold! I wonder if both Jimmy's knew they were gonna do this.
5938	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I almost feel like this was one take and he was genuinely surprised. Could have been some high level improve Will Ferrel wanted to do the absolute mad lad. Had some of the most legendary SNL skits and wants to practice his trade. A rare very entertaining moment for the show
5939	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	"JUST saw the ""TONIGHT SHOW"" with Ryan's part of the sketch, LOL..."
5940	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	When your show is tanking because you're woke af so you try to bring people in with legends.
5941	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Marvel can always hire Will to do their movie marketing and won't need to worry about spoilers
5942	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Viewers: I came looking for gold, and found copper
5943	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan: I don't feel like coming to LA Will: I don't feel like coming to NY. Both: I got an idea
5944	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	The Star Wars sheet pants just make it LOL... Will Ferrel interviews are gold.
5945	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will is at jimmy and ryan is at Jimmy fallon..... both swapped each other to promoted themseleves today and this is just pure genius.
5946	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I hold Matt Damon personally responsible for Will Ferrell being there instead of Ryan Reynolds.... and some guy named Jimmy? I donno.
5947	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	The first guy to be on Kimmel wearing his pyjama.
5948	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell switched interviews 😂
5949	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	This is genius marketing ...will Ferrell and ryan reynolds Fallon and Kimmel...awesome
5950	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	will ferrel just gave me the body positivity that i needed lmao
5951	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	it would've been funnier if will had acted as if he is not friends with Ryan reynolds and has never even met him before
5952	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	The “magic trick” is meta commentary for the fact that they had Will on instead of Ryan, they lured you into watching because it subverted your expectations. You didn’t expect Ferrel to be marketing a movie that’s not his. So you kept watching.
5953	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will's pants are made out of my childhood blanket.
5954	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	It seemed like Jimmy was genuinely surprised...
5955	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will Ferrell literally rolled out of bed to be here.
5956	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan is promoting a movie around this time and Will is promoting a television show around this time. Both have a movie together coming out next year. This is such a weird yet creative form of promotion and I love it.
5957	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Jimmy Fallon & Jimmy Kimmel writers working together to make this skit happen. Pure genius! 😅👍
5958	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	I love how he and Ryan switched Jimmys. 😂🤣 👏🏻
5959	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	does ryan ever show up to anything... I think not
5960	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Just been watching the rayan comin' instead of well clip on falon , and bro ..this gotta be one of the greatest cross overs in comedy in general
5961	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	they funny thing is both will and jimmy born the same year 1967, but will look older than jimmy now haha
5962	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Did Ryan made it in at all?
5963	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Is will Ferrell entering MCU or something? Then what is this multiverse cross overs 😂
5964	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Wills slippers just tie all of this together
5965	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Now I'm wondering if instead of swapping the guest.... they might've have swapped the host
5966	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Hilarious, Ryan did Jimmy Fallon for Will and Will did Jimmy Kimmel for Ryan 🤣🤣🤣🤣
5967	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Hey Will, When's the last time you went to a performance art showing?
5968	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan Reynolds shows up on Jimmy Fallon's show lol HAHAHAHA. What have they done
5969	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will and Ryan swapping places is like the Jimmy shows have a multiverse on its own... niceee...
5970	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Can we have a sequel to The Other Guys where Ryan Reynolds becomes the third guy?!🙏
5971	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Will on Kimmel, Ryan on Fallon..I love it
5972	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	hells yes! this is awesome just came from watching Jimmy Fallon 🤣
5973	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	This is on brand for everyone involved.
5974	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Where's Ryan? 😂😂
5975	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	First! Just seen both of these on TV. Interesting play on how they swapped at the last second
5976	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Ryan should be in Daddy’s Home 3 (if there ever is one). 😂
5977	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3aWvGi9Z3U	Very nice
5978	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	As a Giants fan, I would only do this because it’s a joke.
5979	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	Lol I would be able to do that with the Giants as a Doyers fan, but I could never do that with the Sharks as a Kings fan :o
5980	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	Try this stunt in Boston with Yankees gear, the camera crew would need to be wearing a full suit of armor.
5981	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	And now a bad call by the ump for strike 3 to end it so sad for Giants fans 🧡🖤
5982	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	Wow, they ALL did it. Freaking hilarious. You do that bit in LA and you’ll get shot.
5983	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	As a dodgers fan.. lmaooooo I could never.. Go giants!!! Go home.
5984	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	As a dodger fan, I would never 🤢
5985	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	This for sure fake. They definitely getting paid.
5986	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	No true soccer fan would wear a rivals shirt for a TV bit. Americans sellout so easily. Jeez, what's wrong with them?
5987	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	Been a Red Sox fan all my life! I wouldn’t change it for the world!!! The Red Sox where even in my wedding vows (wife’s a Dodger fan). Let’s go Sox!
5988	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	Now that the Dodgers are down and the series is 2-1, I’m not expecting a lot of laughs from Kimmel and his drones.
5989	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	Dodgers fans are frauds. They hate the Giants but wears 49ers gear LOL
5990	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	I'm from Houston and I bleed Dodger blue since 2019 after I found out about their sign stealing schemes! Go Dodgers! (Or whatever team is hot now.)
5991	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	These aren’t real Giants fans it’s gotta be scripted…I wanna see the b roll where the people they asked refused…I know it exists 😂
5992	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	"These are ""Giants"" fans just like Jimmy Kimmel is funny."
5993	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	This Yankees fan would NEVER do that for the Mets
5994	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	These are really Dodger fans impersonating Giants fans. No self respecting Giants fan would put anything Dodgers on their person.
5995	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	OH man this is soooooooo funny!!!!!
5996	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	FAKE! These are all paid actors. There is no way would any real Giants fans would do this. Do better Jimmy! GO GIANTS!!!
5997	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	It’s ok. I walk around SF in dodgers shirts, and when I go to LA, I wear giants shirts. Just funny to me
5998	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	No REAL Giants fans would ever put on Dodgers gear, gross 🤢 I'd be just as reluctant as the last girl LMAO
5999	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	😀😃😄😁😆🥲🤣😂😅😂🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Take that SUCKERS, I cant stop laughing at this, no matter from what angle you see it in. Awesome awesome awesome, Viva Los Angeles, Go Dodger Blue.
6000	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	I understand this is probably fake and the people are getting paid. But as a diehard Giants fan I would never touch anything with a Dodgers symbol.
6001	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	"I actually yelled ""Nooooooooooo!"" at my screen when that last girl showed up ""wearing"" the Dodgers shirt. And she was going so strong up until then! Her passion and commitment actually made me want to be a Giants fan. Now, I don't know how I feel. 🤷‍♂️😉"
6002	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	This is a reminder how easy it is to do something unimaginable where other people around you feel super chill about it, and when they seem respected. Unless you practice saying ‘no’ on daily basis.
6003	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	I love it! This video exposes how WACK SF is. Way too many implants. Lmao
6004	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	I feel the same way about the NY Giants; easily swayed bc what the entire hell are they even doing?
6005	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	If the blonde chick is such a big Giants fan, then why would she wear 1989 World Series Gear? The A's swept the Giants in that World Series!
6006	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	Did they at least get paid to be traitors?
6007	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	Watching these people lie so easily just to get on television makes it easy to see how trump could get people to lie about him.
6008	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	I’m a sf giants and no way in hell Would I do this for tv . Funny though fake fans 🤣🤣🤣
6009	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	This would never happen. I now know that they paid Dodgers fans to put on Giant's gear and then switch back.
6010	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWt4k3GM6HI	I'm fan of the blond sweet heart. She's hot 🥰🤤

Here in Italy we know her because she acted with Dario Argento, but she has an international career ahead of her, also because she acted together with David Bowie!
6039	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s323wdjE02Q	Ironic, their daughter's name is Agnes

6046	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	I loved her in 'Oscar', she plays Lisa, the daughter of Sly Stallone's character, Snaps Provolone, a mafia boss.
6047	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	had a crush on her since Cousin Vinnie and it's never gone away, she's still a knockout with a vibrant shining personality
6048	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	She aged like a fine wine. Love how she keeps eating during the interview
6049	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Wait... So Melissa Tomei, Lisa Bonet, Jason Mamoa, Zoe Kravitz, and Lenny Kravitz all hang out and have dinners together? That's too many attractive people in one place.
6050	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	My Cousin Vinny is a classic. Hope it's get inducted in National Film Registry. She did a great job playing Aunt May. Too bad she died.
6051	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	So let me get this straight… Zoe Kravitz is the daughter of Lisa Bonet and Lenny Kravitz, step-daughter of Jason Momoa, goddaughter of Marisa Tomei and Cree Summer, girlfriend of Channing Tatum, a distant relative of Al Roker AND CATWOMAN? Holy shit she’s got it all 😭😂
6052	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	I didn't know Marisa Tomei was Zoe Kravitz's godmother
6053	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	She's 57!!! 57!!! Like whaaaaat?!!!??
6054	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Cant believe this beautiful woman is 57 years old!! I seriously thought she was 30+ years old in spiderman
6055	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	She’s the definition of aging like fine wine! Simply beautiful, there’s a video she did for Vogue, I believe about make up tips. She has no make up at all at the beginning of the video n she looks exactly the same. #naturalbeauty
6056	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	"i cant read ""Marisa Tomei"" name without having George Costanza voice saying it in my head. Yes i binge Seinfeld quite recently."
6057	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	She’s my favorite Aunt May.
6058	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Say what you want about Jimmy but he knows how to treat her female guests I love him🥺😍
6059	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	If you don't love Marisa Tomei, I don't think I can trust you.
6060	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	She won’t spoil anything because she knows that with great power comes great responsibility
6061	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Tomei has aged very well and gratuitously as in wow, she’s still looks young and beautiful.
6062	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	This confirms that laughing is the key of aging young !
6063	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	She is 57!!!!!
6064	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	I love that she actually kept eating the sandwich. Anytime a guest gets food on a talk show like this, they take a little bite and never touch it again.
6065	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	57 years old and she looks almost half her age. So youthful.
6066	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	I love it!!! She keeps nibbling away at the sandwich throughout the interview. That’s cool!!!
6067	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Being able to hang out with celebs and put on a comedy news routine for a crowd seems like it would be one of the best jobs ever.
6068	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Both Marisa and Ralph Macchio found the secret to eternal youth
6069	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Props to the Roots for playing the real Spider Man song as the walkout song! Wishing they had included it in this clip! :)
6070	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	She's still going to be just as hot at 60... imagine that
6071	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	"I knew May was alive, Peter Said ""We're okay""...here she is doing interviews😅"
6072	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	I love love love her...she is so relatable n seems so kind n absolutely stunning she looks younger here than in My Cousin Vinny which btw is one of my favz
6073	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	She probably doesn't care but she doesn't have to, she just needs to understand her character.
6074	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Did she like the sandwich?!
6075	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	I can't wait for Spider-Man to come out in theaters
6076	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	I would love to try that sandwich! I've always dreamed of eating Marisa Tomei!!
6077	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	How old is she? i assumed mid 30s?? but ovbs not haha
6078	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	I absolutely 💯 love Marisa Tomei.
6079	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Weirdly, Sally Field’s Aunt May was one of my first crushes. The night Ben didn’t back, I was ready to hit that sack. Note, I was like 14, but I don’t think she could’ve resisted my ability to make S’mores with S’mores Pop tarts, and do a Kickflip.
6080	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	aging like wine
6081	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	With great power comes great responsibility
6082	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Too Bad the studio execs had to cave in to p.p.'s selfish insecurities and have this Pretty Lady Killed (as collateral damage).. 😐🙄🙄🙄🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️
6083	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	So catwoman’s godmother is also spiderman’s aunt…lol
6084	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	She played one of the best performances and female/feminine characters in My Cousin Vinny. Not to mention she will never not be stunning… And so sweet! P.S. I added feminine because it wasn’t just one of the best female performances, but one of the best performances of that early 90’s era. Her femininity just knocks it up even a few more notches…
6085	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	she is such a ray of sunshine and her personality is so fun! i love her :)
6086	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fGEtOzBQao	Everyone’s Aunt May!

6090	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	i can see why fuck is censored but balls are you kidding me lmao. it's a late night show not some morning show that kids watch
6091	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I'm so abessed with ZAC EFRON😍😍💍👌💎🙌👏💯😭🙏
6092	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Did Zac and Sami break up??
6093	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Cmon every kid is cursing and watching porn nowadays why did you censor that?

6095	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I'm a straight dude but he's like the only guy in the world that I can say is attractive with 100% confidence.
6096	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Fallon is a little bitch about language
6097	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	"Zac Efron saying ""Fuck"" & ""Balls"" or taking off his shirt, isn't okay?! Don't be fuck, Jimmy Fallon! The kids these days are watching The Kardashians & Donald Trump. The F-word is the least of worries in America. That's why Ellen & Wendy Williams (from America) and James Corden & Graham Norton (from the U.K.) are better Talk shows/hosts."
6098	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Zac Efron has turned into such a good damn actor! Did not expect that from his teenage bullshit movie days but he is awesome
6099	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I feel like jimmy says every movie he's seen has been his favorite movie he's seen in a while
6100	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Zac is so magical
6101	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Zac Effron is like the Ruby Rose for the male community. They're always making you question your sexuality😒
6102	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Jimmy is a great host but he interrupts sooo much. I always want to hear what the celebrities have to say !!
6103	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	"Zac: ""I idolize Seth he's my hero."" Me: ""Why?"" hahaha"
6104	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	He makes me question my sexuality
6105	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	He's not a very good actor, But he seems like a really nice guy.
6106	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I loveee him since Troy Bolton❤️
6107	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	"I love how ""cursing"" on TV is such a big deal in America while F-bombs and all sorts are being thrown all over the place on British talk shows. Haha"
6108	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	You can´t curse at 11 pm. Men, that sucks!
6109	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	He would make all the guys want to be gay
6110	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I'm the straightest guy you will ever see but zac is fuckin georgous for a guy
6111	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	wow he's attractive
6112	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Why is it a crime to swear on this show? They just blank it out anyway..
6113	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	This cant be the same guy from High school musical....right?
6114	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	fuck that he is hotttttttt
6115	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	ibnjd9uocjndk zac efron is just perf.
6116	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I don't know why, but Zac was SO cute when he apologized...
6117	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I clicked on this video hoping zac would actually take of his shirt, not talking about taking his shirt off, lol.
6118	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Most of the Disney stars have gone on to singing instead of acting like Selena or Miley. He is one of the few to actually stay in acting. If I have to pick a star who is actually doing productive acting and not making a fool of themselves, it would either be him or Emily Osment.
6119	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I wish i had zac's power of turning straight men gay
6120	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	What is it that Jimmy is always writing during the talk?
6121	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Wow he cursed on tv. Shocking! Outrageous!! Mind blowing!!!
6122	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Do people not get that jimmy was JOKINGLY about the cursing thing? Lol why are people taking him so serious. We all know jimmy doesn't care.
6123	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	This proves that Jimmy Fallon is amazing at what he does. He at first joked about Zac's swearing, but he noticed that Zac seemed kind of uncomfortable and embarrassed for doing this, so he cursed too, to make Zac feel better about it. Notice how relieved Zac looked after Jimmy did this! What an amazing guy.
6124	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	THE GAY TENSION IN THIS IS REAL
6125	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	zac's got a potty mouth
6126	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Jimmy Fallon's the worst interviewer ever. It's well known that Zac Efron suffered from a substance abuse problem while filming Neighbors and Fallon asks Efron if he partied a lot while making it? Do your job as a talk show host and research your guest and their film, before asking triggering questions. Also, that tired joke Fallon makes of being scandalized at guests' swearing on the show. Shut up! It's a late night show, they can beep it out in time, and people swear when telling funny stories and being relaxed, which is-hello!-how you want celebrities to be when doing an interview on your show. I know this will be an unpopular opinion cuz everyone loooooves Fallon and how dare anyone speak out against him. But he just really annoys me. Like his dumb games he forces guests to play when they appear on the show. Forcing someone to throw water on themselves and thus ruin their nice suit, or forcing them to wear silly shoes and trip around, is annoying. It's like he wants so embarrass celebrities because he has a complex and is jealous of them. Oh, he probably does all these silly, idiotic antics to hide the fact that he's a terrible interviewer who has zero rapport with his interviewees. Sorry not sorry.

6128	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Zac is like one of the only, if not the only Disney Channel star especially from his time period that successfully broke away from that image, and is now being taken seriously as an actor. And for that I give him props. Coming from a 21 year old straight dude who hopes to become a great actor one day, he's moving up my list of actors that I look up to.
6129	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I'm not even a little gay, but Zac Efron is a handsome dude.
6130	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	"""...and Seth was just f***kin with me"" ""*eh-hem..*. um. pretty sure ur not allowed to say that on TV ._."" ""O_O WOAH I'M SORRY!!"" XD LOL LOVED IT"
6131	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I wish American talk shows were like British ones in that guests can talk normally, and don't have to worry about saying 'bad words'.
6132	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Fallon is so awful.
6133	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	How *do* you break your hand reaching for someone's balls? Confused.
6134	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	3:17 something falls our of Jimmy's Jacket???
6135	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	My god he's a handsome guy. And props to him for breaking free of his 'trademark' role. Daniel Radcliffe and Robert Pattinson won't do this.
6136	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	the movie actually looks funny. i can't wait to see it.
6137	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	3:11....LEGENDARY!!!!
6138	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Poor zac - fallon is a bit annoying!!!!
6139	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Christ Fallon let the guy tell his story. He couldn't even tell us how he broke his hand cause Jimmy wouldn't shut the fuck up.
6140	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	"Jimmy is a fucking liar...""best film ever"" WTF?"
6141	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Jimmy cutting people off. Love jimmy but sometimes he doesn't let people talk. Right at the beginning he cuts him off.
6142	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	jimmy is just hyping up every movie would kill him give honest review of movie?! smh
6143	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Ariana Grande can sing it, but Zac can't say it?
6144	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	God jimmy is such a suck up to everybody who comes on his show.
6145	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	try and pause it at 1:25
6146	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	I never wanted to like him. He's better than me, in every possible way. But he's such a nice dude. Fuck him.
6147	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	it's so ridiculous that you can't even curse on a late night show...
6148	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-oQlSgLiFw	Well that Batman clip wasn't too funny...
6149	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Jimmy to Tom: No one does do like you anymore... Jackie Chan: Really?
6150	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	What if we see tom as new ironman ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
6151	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	People focus too much on the stupid Scientology crap. Instead of just admiring him for his acting skills and entertaining us the way he does. Love Tom❤️ great admiration for him
6152	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Heheheha ja hes shall filming inn Norway ☺️🔥❤️ stay safe
6153	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	I feel Tom Cruise and Michael Jackson have one key similarity—both greats in their respective fields with a different class altogether, but Americans never appreciate(d) them as much as the rest of the world does!!
6154	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	And because of this movie we got fucking justice league's bad superman
6155	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	This kind of.stunt is insane...in split of second he'll die so handsome!...
6156	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	BOOM CHACA LACA
6157	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	This guy is stuck in the 80's maybe he doesn't know about this new tech called VFX and green-screens noone does it like this now (lookwise also he still looks like he's in his early youth)
6158	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	"Go to hell Tom Cruise! You are a Worthless Basterd! Your a Basterd!!!!!!! I cant believe you spent over a decade stalking me! P.S. I would like my job at ""comcast"" back bc I know you did that too. When are you going to wake up and grow up! Go to hell."
6159	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Why did he choose scientology .
6160	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Tom cruise is a weirdo
6161	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Boycott Tom Cruise movies. Self important jerk who promotes a cult and uses slave labor from Scientologist members.
6162	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Tom Cruise is highly admired and respected. He’s perfect man😍😍😍😍😍
6163	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	People in US really mean to Tom. It seems no matter how many good things he did, people just hate him and refuse to forgive him. His religion, his own opinion toward the treatment of depression, jumping on the couch...these are the reasons people hate him, can’t believe this is happening in the worls’s most international and well developed country...
6164	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	4:44
6165	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Tom is awesome and to do his own stunts is amazing, Tom does it all. That video showing his accident, was like, scary and for him to carry on the take shows what a awesome actor he is, he is a mission impossible as Tom keeps on going. Fallout is amazing. Keep bringing us awesome movies like you have done for the past 30+ years since The Outsiders. Love your work Tom. And Jimmy, thank you for being a great host, especially the lip sync.
6166	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	1986 - Tom Cruise is awesome we like him! 2005 - Tom Cruise is bat shit crazy, don't wanna see him in anything ever! 2018 - Tom Cruise is awesome we like him again!
6167	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	"Tom Cruise, would you please play the roll of ""Robert Muller"" in the movie... There has to be a movie, please!"
6168	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	That was the best movie I have seen in a long time! Never seen any and I went just for Henry and it reminded me of what a great actor Tom Cruise is. I have since watched all the movies and love them all! Please do another MI :)
6169	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	So handsome and charming. If he can't sell Scientology, no one can.
6170	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Hey who freaking cares about Tom's personal life, from what I've seen on camera, he is a great person who works hard for the money he earns and nobody should be throwing hate on him for rumors of things he has done
6171	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	i love you Tom. you're the best💓
6172	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Tom Cruise !!!! 😍😍😍😍
6173	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	I want to see tom cruise and jackie chan in one movie...

6175	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Despite what everyone says about him and his beliefs and religion etc, he is a top Class guy and a really nice person, I have respect for this man.
6176	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Does America give him the respect he deserves??? He is jus awesome
6177	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Bourne > Mission Impossible
6178	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Mission Impossible: Try looking incredibly young just like Tom Cruise.
6179	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	I know a couple of people who met Tom Cruise in “everyday” situations. He engaged in a 30 min conversation with one of them. A true gentleman. I will watch his movies wholeheartedly.
6180	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	jesus Jimmy Fallon is terrible at interviewing
6181	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Looking healthy compared to a few years ago! The divorce must've really effected him.
6182	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	i wish i could meet Tom, just to shake his hand and say 'thank you' to him for almost killing himself for the sake of our entertainment!
6183	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	You know life sucks when Tom Cruise is better looking even at 56 than you are at 17 😕
6184	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	My favourite Tom Cruise movie is still Far and Away ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
6185	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Too bad it's become fashionable to hate on this man nowadays. He is the last true action hero from the last century.
6186	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Tom looks so much better now that he's cut down on the botox.
6187	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	He's still killing it like no one else!
6188	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Tom Cruise is the Michael Jackson of cinema. Simply the best. He was a huge star when he did Top Gun back in 86 and now 32 years laters still making excellent blockbusters. Salute to the man.
6189	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	If you support Tom Cruise, you support the cult of Scientology.
6190	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	I give a challenge to find any interview or public appearance from last 15 years where he is not smiling, he smiles constantly without break
6191	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Best , he really deserves big paycheck ;-)
6192	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	People may not like his religious beliefs but man is he an amazing and dedicated actor!
6193	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Now tell me where that Fountain of Youth is Tom!!!!
6194	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Diesel ,The Rock..who?? tom is a real action hero!!
6195	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	I hope this one(MI6) turns out to be the best in the series. The first MI was great, 2nd was Meh, 3rd was okay but then 4th and 5th were fantastic! Respect for the Legend. 🙇🙏
6196	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	he looks so young for his age
6197	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Jimmy: Henry is a big dude Tom: He's a big boy, great actor Henry: Thanks guys I know I'm a cute big mustache boy
6198	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Man, he's 56y.o and still look so damn hot ♡♡♡
6199	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Tom Cruise and Jackie Chan movies are the closest thing to superheroes, they do most of the stunts without those green screens marvel and dc movies use, you can sense how real the scenes
6200	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	Got my ticket for Friday on IMAX!
6201	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	He doesn't age, weird.
6202	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	He is such an underrated actor!!! So much hate for him it makes me sick! The guy is incredible one of the greatest actors and one of the most hard working actors... and people hate because of his personal life choices... or because they think he’s weird because he’s passionate about stuff... just watch the movies he makes..enjoy them!! Thats what they are there for!! People need to stop being so judgmental of every little thing!!
6203	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si4-VzckyWg	I'm going to watch it for my birthday tomorrow and I'm sooooo excited I LOVE Tom cruise 😍😍😍

6377	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsgj0UdxMSQ	I love how Brad doesn't do interviews anymore but these skits instead! I still remember his yodeling bit!
6378	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsgj0UdxMSQ	I have always loved Brad Pitt since Fight Club, until I saw him in that film I was so annoyed with how overrated he was.
6379	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsgj0UdxMSQ	I read the title and knew what the sketch would be but it didn't make it any less hilarious for me.
6380	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsgj0UdxMSQ	Who all thought, Imma try do what Brad Pitt did after watching this? #SoMuchFreeFood Also, Jimmy's expressions 😂

6382	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsgj0UdxMSQ	Haha first
6383	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Why didn't he just eat them on the way back?
6384	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Fun fact: this is voiced by Arin from game grumps and this joke comes from his play through of dead or alive
6385	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Where was the joke? Sadly didnt feel this one
6386	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Fun fact: Most of us eat bananas before they are ripe. The fruit itself is brown when it is ripe. Makes great banana bread, but ripe bananas are not pleasurable to eat raw.
6387	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	This is actually relatable. Usually I get bananas that are just about to ripen and try to finish them off within a week.🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
6388	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	I like how he just pass by COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE man . I though that coffe emergency is more important than banana emergency . It looks that all my life was a lie .
6389	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Fun fact: mushy bananas make a far better banana bread than ripe bananas.
6390	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	I love how the bananas change each time they're not in frame
6391	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	those bananas must've somehow been traveling close to the speed of light, while appearing to be stationary to everyone else. that's the only explanation.
6392	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	My dad usually makes Turon (Banana Lumpia) out of overripe bananas. Always says never waste food. And damn he knows how to make a delicious Turon 😋
6393	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	I understand this man’s stress. Me: *Buys bananas on Saturday.* Me on Tuesday: WTF bananas?! If he hasn’t smashed with his face, he could’ve made banana bread!
6394	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	The fruit flies 😂😂😂😂 “I be like oh shit the bananas!” 🤣🤣🤣
6395	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	I hope what ever is getting ready to come out to happiness and Cyanide has some great dark humor like back in the day
6396	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Father has failed I AM FATHER NOW. Single handedly my favourite cyanide and happiness quote
6397	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	"So...anyone here who bakes a little bit and thought, ""Those can still be used to make banana bread?"""
6398	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Dunno what they're freaking out about, I'd straight up make banana bread with overripe bananas xD
6399	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	You know, I can understand crying over spilled milk, but this is bananas...
6400	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	My father told me that my great-grandfather would store bananas in the freezer and wait till they were pitch black before eating them. Claimed that was when they were the sweetest and just eat them with a spoon when they got to his liking.
6401	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	From the title I thought this was gonna be a “I swear to God doc, I was just minding my own business making a smoothie while naked when I tripped and it just went right up there when I landed on it” situation.
6402	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Here's a tip. Do NOT put them in the refrigerator. They will darken sooner. Also a brown banana does not mean it is bad. It could be but if you don't have any experience you should taste it first.
6403	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	"I didn't realize this was Arin until he let out that ""Fuuuuccckk"", and then I immediately knew who was voicing him lol"
6404	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Only in America can Banana's go bad on the way home
6405	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	The Family Had No Bananas to Eat. That Looks Really Sad.
6406	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	"Ok, but are we not gonna talk about the lack of "" - Cyanide & Happiness Shorts"" in the title? (Same case with the previous short, but no one seemed to have talk about it)"
6407	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Bananas don't ripen that fast
6408	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Last episode was rlly dark and serious, this is the opposite and it’s beautiful
6409	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	*This just in: Man goes bananas after buying bananas with a shelf life of 5 minutes. Eyewitnesses claim the following:* Some man in an orange shirt crossing the street: I was just going to work, crossing this street like I always do, then suddenly I hear a car honk. I was startled and confused. Before I knew what was going on, that guy nearly ran me over. I could just dive out of the way. Coffee man: I was on my way to get my morning coffee, then I suddenly saw a maniac drive by me. By the way, you wouldn't happen to have some coffee, do you? No? Oh well. COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE. Old lady: What's that, deary? What I saw about some guy with bananas? What are you people talking about? I was just heading back to my home, visiting my grandchildren. Suddenly I felt my car moving slightly faster than usual, so I hit the brakes... Oh s*!t, is that the MEDS? I gotta move!
6410	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Wait, you WANT green, absolutely tasteless bananas? They are best when they are yellow with some brown spots on them.
6411	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	He actually likes bananas too ripe and pretends to try very hard to save the bananas. In the end he buries his face into the delicious pile of rotten bananas and cries in delight Edit: He's got more than what he expected. He also found a successor to his role and can now dig in his bananas carefree
6412	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	I love how the man walking across the street was just taking his sweet time.
6413	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	This is actually relatable. Usually I get bananas that are just about to ripen and try to finish them off within a week.
6414	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
6415	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	I expected a creepy incestrous post credit scene. Well, the internet has ruined me.....
6416	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Fun fact: you can see the coffee man on his way to get a frappuccino
6417	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	But can the “new father” get the bananas home safely
6418	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Yeah more Cyanide and happiness short
6419	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	He should have bought the Peaches too🍑🍑🍑
6420	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	This tale is a sad novel about a man and his apples
6421	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Tip: don’t put them next to other fruit in the fruit bowl
6422	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	The biggest tragedy known to man.
6423	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	These videos always makes our days better
6424	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	The fact that I can relate to this in some way…
6425	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	I think he should go to a different store next time. Those bananas have an awfully small shelf life
6426	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	"Okay...who besides me expected the bananas to start attacking him and his family? Get it? Go ""bad""...🤔"
6427	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	The amount of sadness and emotion I felt tho
6428	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	I was eating a banana when this came out, I feel called out. Just wrap them up man.
6429	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Why did they spoil so fast?!
6430	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Wife: Where are you? Man: 🍌🍌🍌 FUCK Im surprised she didn’t mistake his intentions 🤭

6432	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	They can still make banana bread
6433	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAvXVLQGvJU	Why tha like button different

6525	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	this might sound weird but who else thought about twisting their own nipples to see what would happen after watching this video LOL
6526	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Ik this is a joke and all, but I'mma just explain why men have nipples just in case someone does happen to be curious. As you are growing in the womb, it's not certain until mid-late pregnancy that it's decided what gender you're gonna be, and nipples and the capabilities to lactate just so happen to grow before it's decided, so even tho it's completely impossible for men to produce milk(from their chest) its already been done.
6527	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	that’s (insert made up problem here)phobic!
6528	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	who twists his nipples after watching this
6529	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	So, the gays play guitar? That sounds like some undercover code.
6530	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	God...
6531	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Men are able to produce milk The milk comes out of special glands like are spit glands (Glands are kinda like generators) Men just have much smaller ones correct me if I’m wrong with anything
6532	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Don't use the mic jack for your own sanitation
6533	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	They have pants?
6534	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Men actually only have nips because everyone starts of as xx female but when they lose apart of that and become xy some things still remain, hence for some they are trans gender because they either feel like the xx should've been xy or that they feel that they lost their xx even though they didn't feel like it was them So at the start of life everyone's a girl Until the body changes
6535	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Reject humanity return to guitar
6536	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	This is a lie
6537	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	"""Yeeeh?"""
6538	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Nipples(and lactation glands)are vestiges from when we were females in the womb. There's no real evolutionary pressure to have men not produce these structures, and any mutation in a male might affect females being born in the next generation, which puts those particular traits at an evolutionary disadvantage. Also, they feel nice when I rub them.
6539	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	I wanna see him either go to an open mic using his friend as an instrument or starting a band.
6540	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	There is an actual purpose of men's nip: To distinguish if one is forward or backward facing
6541	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	This had a better plot than every yaoi we wrote in HS
6542	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	"""Like nobody is attracted to male nipples"" Guess I'm nobody."
6543	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	It's quite simple really. The right nipple is used to regulate body temperature whilst the left nipple is used to pick up shortwave radio transmissions. :-)
6544	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	"It's because when a person is first developing, they exist in a kind of ""genderless"" state before the body commits to becoming female or male. (Some people view this time as a period where everyone is ""female"" and can either shift to male or fully commit to being female, but that's not the point.) It is during that time that the nipples form. So, even though males don't really have a use for them, it's too late to do anything about it. They're already there."
6545	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	As a man, I can confirm, this is how we work.
6546	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Nipples are what makes you a true mammal. Be PROUD of the mammary!
6547	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	"Smiled at my husband and he immediately responded, ""It does not work like that. Do NOT even try."""
6548	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	We all have beta features but still experimental, luckily we going to have the new update soon, thnx for the video.
6549	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	I actually know the answer to this: it’s because when you’re developing in the womb the default gender you get made as is female, so when you actually become male, the nipples are leftover from before the gender was finalized. It’s maybe a bit different but that’s the gist of it.
6550	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Wish I could do more than to just like this masterpiece
6551	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	And I’ve been using them for breastfeeding this whole times

6554	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	So when your brother comes home with a deeper voice, you know why
6555	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	In case you are wondering, men have nipples because the fetus starts as females and undergo the male transformation later. So the nipples don't evolve further but they don't disappear either.
6556	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	I died at the whammy bar part. Was not expecting that to happen.
6557	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	This is accurate can confirm. Although mine can even shoot lasers from them sometimes, but I gotta get really high for that to happen
6558	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	The scientific reason behind it is body creates nipples before gender is chosen no matter if he's a girl or boy that's why.
6559	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Can’t imagine what they twisted on Prince to make him sing like that.
6560	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Ok, seriously, I'm at work right now and I just laughed my ass off, people are wondering what I'm doing 😂🤣

6564	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	So he just had “it” out the whole time?

6570	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Now the question has to be asked: was he turning a lever, pulling a knob or twisting a valve?
6571	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	It's because in the womb everyone is born in the image of the mother than hormones and other chemicals define gender
6572	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	Oh there’s my volume settings! No, but really the reason is a lot simpler: they develop on the fetus before sex is actually determined!
6573	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM9LyJBmBEg	I'm pretty sure most men would make that noise if some other man used our whammy bar

6619	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Well, see you all in 7 years!
6620	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Girls look good with messy hair, I wonder why I don’t see that more often.
6621	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Fun facts: never tell your second date if you have first date.
6622	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Did he have teeth? LoOk closely at his mouth when he talks
6623	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Why is every guy bald? Lmao
6624	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	I’m trying to figure out which person I am, and I don’t like it.
6625	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Not gonna lie, I kinda felt bad for the first woman. 😔
6626	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	F for me... Had never kissed in my 20 yers, i'm not loser, just introvert.
6627	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	And then he only bangs on the third date She should be coming soon...
6628	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	*Hello there.* _Ever wanted your daily dose of hello there?_ Well over 6.27k people apparently did…maybe it’s because they couldn’t get enough of Obi-Wan Kenobi?
6629	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	I am disturbed by the possibility that that kiss was rotoscoped.
6630	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Wait till she gets her second date
6631	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	After second date kiss should come third date for sexy time.
6632	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	In a real situation, that guy would get his ass kicked.
6633	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Him: I don't kiss until the second date! Me: I don't kiss until the first! Get it, cause I'm a loser...

6638	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Imagine being such a chad that your second date doesn't care you're dating someone else
6639	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ImqjRkD_w	Oh that's just messed up- But that's Cyanide & Happiness for ya.

6698	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	Verse 1] I'm so sick and tired of being alone Binge watching movies in my home And... I don't know what to do... [Verse 2] All the games I play All feel the same CS and Clash, Animal Crossing, man... Can we get something new? [Verse 3] No, I hate to paint Origami's lame Puzzles frustrate! Read a book? No Way! Cus... I am not home schooled! [Verse 4] Don't feel like... Working out or cleaning up The productive stuff is just not fun and... Ugh, there's just nothing to do! [Verse 5] Sitting and chilling Staring up into the ceiling Knitting mittens in the kitchen Watching silly little kittens Practice kissing with a fist and... Distance pissing without missing Really missing the feeling of grilling Even if I never did... I know! I could finally clean my shoes Then again, on Instagram My friends are taking shots of booze Why not? There's nothing else that anyone of us can do Can't learn a skill... Perfect a meal... Or look up anything we choose! Cus ugh... There's just nothing here to do!Verse 6] I could fix that clock that's an hour off Tik Tok... Different shirt! Woah! Different Spot But.. That's just too hard to do Build a blanket fort... Or a house of cards... Construction paper shadow art I'd, draw my own tattoo Flip flop trick shots... Ping pong, flip cup... Swing a dog, hip thrust... Sing a song, Rick Ross... (Ugh!) There's still nothing to do! [Verse 7] Yeah there's... People dying and loved ones cry... Loss jobs, stock market crash in sight... But hey! I'm important too! (Mhmm) (Duh!) Can't believe this is happening to me! Like why me? I'm so sick of home food! I mean it's not that bad but I hate leftovers... Please RT so the government can see! Quarantining is rude! Like do they even care about our happiness? This is so not a mood! I mean like a bad one if anything... Cus there's just nothing to do! Ugh, and I'm getting kinda fat...
6699	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	Ryan is so underrated, he needs to be noticed more, he's so amazing in so many ways and the effort he puts in his videos are fire...
6700	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	Asians taught us to fight hard and the wisdoms of marshal arts and now americans beat asian americans who never even been to Woohan or China and never ate a bat.

6724	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	Still mad that Pewdiepie's unoriginal, no effort and hardly funny of a channel has more subs that Nigahiga. It just makes no sense whatsoever. Nigahiga is the embodiment of Quality over Quantity, you'd think Youtube would reward his insane amounts of effort he puts into his videos.
6725	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	just post videos its been 5 fucking months
6726	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	Dear Ryan, Going so long without a video of yours is making me so sad. Love your videos and cant wait for more! I hope you're well! Your fan =)
6727	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	“Stay home, cook rice” has never felt so relevant
6728	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	Sadly I feel RHPC is over for Ryan he was a legend and inspired me to want to make youtube videos and you know if he one day post again that will be amazing and I'll be there of it comes but for now I just want to thank you Ryan for all the laughs and Teehees and videos here on this platform that you gave us truly amazing
6729	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	Him: 1 month in quarantine Me: *Laughing in insanity* there’s 7 actually
6730	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	There's nothing to do cuz Ryan isn't entertaining us!
6731	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	I mean you could make another song witjout reusing old music

6736	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	he literally learned to knit, balanced a card deck house, did trick shots that take enough takes to make you go crazy, made a stop motion with probably every coloured shirt he has , possibly used a sharpie on his chest, composed a rap, scenario and dressed up as his long lost alts and even used the best og joke at the end just to make sure we get supreme quality content during this time of boredom and make us smile.
6737	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	If u didn’t know Ryan is gaming on Higa tv and twitch

6825	174	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	2:24 I feel it should be highlighted how incredibly well Ryan contrasts these tragedies with the rest of the song. The images and lyrics really remind us of just how severe the situation really is, while pointing out how much we can help simply by quarantining ourselves.

He really should be more talked about honestly Edit: When I say over-looked; I understand he has many subscribers and was the most popular person on the platform at one point, however when thinking of youtube in the last decade and legendary you tubers, Ryan is often overlooked and not talked about enough in today’s space

6900	249	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSD2d8uU6Mo	A lot of people (including myself) just took the lockdown as staying at home bored, wasting precious time. This should have been the best opportunity to take the free time to finally do some of the things we wanted or needed to do like learning new skills, cleaning our rooms/house, and so when this is all over with... we can come out as an improved version of ourselves.

My female relatives reguIarly throw parties but only white men are invited, it's like a scene from a whorehouse near a US military base in Asia. I overheard a female cousin saying that Asian men can only score with morbidly obese Black women who has children from different men. My sister told me that she finds all Asian men to be ugly and repulsive. She felt like vomiting whenever an Asian man flirted with her. My sister is married to a white man and have 2 sons, one look kinda white while the other look Asian. Guess who is my sister's fave son. Hint: the Asian looking son tried to commit suicide. US Asian women prefer white men like Robert Aaron Long over Asian men. US Asian women are perpetuating the supremacy of White men. Enough of this mess. I will be retiring in Asia soon. Maybe I should ask my Asian looking nephew if he wants to join me, maybe he will be happier in Asia.

6927	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	You need to hear of the Gospel of hope that *only Lord Jesus Christ can give you* . Many of you are sad and hopeless, I want you to know that there’s more to life. There’s also eternity in Heaven and Hell, this life is temporary, choose life, Lord Jesus Christ didn’t come to condemn anyone, He came to save us all from eternity in Hell. The devil tells you to live for temporary pleasure and forfeit eternal joy, peace and love forever. Seriously, just for 5 minutes of pleasure? It’s not only foolish it’s completely not worth it and unfulfilling. *Please choose life dear souls.* God loves you so much. Anyone who thinks the Name of Lord Jesus Christ is a joke and who boldly mocks and scorns Him and takes pleasure in people like this is in for a big unpleasant surprise on judgement day. Hell is very hot people repent! In the mighty name of Lord Jesus Christ! Lord Jesus Christ is coming back everyone don’t worship celebrities and music, focus on Him alone, I promise there’s more to life than money, partying, sex, homosexuality, swearing, immodesty and music. Hell is real, repent from sinning confess your sins and ask God to forgive you, I know He will if you’re sincere. Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Santa Clausism, Confucianism, halloweenism and other religions that are outside Christianity lead to hell, don’t believe them, believe the Almighty God and Father of Lord Jesus Christ who begot Him, our God is mighty He doesn’t need a woman to beget a son, He is God. I choose to put my faith in a God who can do anything and everything, a God who has unlimited power to beget!

7009	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	Ryan is right about the double standard that exists in the hateful world of racism. Eventhough the degree of harshness and level of hatred towards blackpeople is severe, It is still not fair that we get to make jokes about Asians and even Caucasians ever so freely.

7033	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	For some reason, I feel like people are less offended when black people are racist because of the amount of racism towards black people in the past

I am a white chick whose high school boyfriend was a super hot Asian guy - and this was back in the 80s when you rarely saw a white chick with an Asian guy. IN fact, people stared at us all the time. I went on to marry a different Asian guy - who turned out to be a jerk - but had 4 very attractive hapa kids with him. Divorced his ass after 20 years of marriage. I've dated Asian, white and black men and only ever cared if they were good and decent men. Btw Ryan - my 19 year old son loves your humor! And I love your hair! Cheers!"

7086	178	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	"BTS, or SHINEE, anybody? I'm not super into Kpop, but MAN. Those guys are hella hot. I think there's this stigma between making black jokes versus any other race because here in America, black American's are still working towards equal rights. The major immoral laws (*cough* Jim Crow *cough) may have been removed, but so many extremely traditional people from around that time own businesses and are incredibly biased and racist, still making climbing the bullshit social ranks more than difficult for any black American. Due to the constant emphasis of this continuing movement, there is a definite negative staple upon making fun of African Americans, resulting in downplaying the teasing of any other race. I hate the incessant hypocrisy surrounding making jokes on blacks vs whites vs Asians vs anyotherrace. Two will go unnoticed, yet the other two garner hate and sometimes even death threats. If jokes at one race can be tolerated, than jokes on any other ought to be tolerated as well. Besides, race shouldn't matter anyways. Sure, different races might be the faces of each of their unique cultures and countries, but it's not one's appearance that counts. It's their heart, actions, and the beautiful culture behind that personality. ""A cover is not the book"", if you will. Somebody please notice my reference."

I was super pissed, not at the fact that she was making fun of our eyes but the fact that she said it was completely ok for her to do it cause she was asian. (I'm not saying all Indians are like this nor am I saying all Indians are people who make fun of other races, in fact 2 of my best friends are Both Indian and are great people) I was SUPER mad at the fact that she said it's ok to make fun of asian eyes cause she was asian, when her eyes weren't even ""tiny"" or she has not been bullied about it once in her life. I found it so hypocritical, unfair and dumb and it really made me mad... if you read this far, kudos to you. Thank you for letting me rant about my life issues"

7201	293	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	"Media plays the biggest role here. Attractiveness of Asian men can be changed quickly actually...but but but lets think about it... LOL. First of all, East Asian men are the smartest out there and you think Hollywood would cast attractive Asian actors and have them play the main role? Noway jose. You think Hollywood(Jews) would let East Asian men, who are the most intelligent(along with Jews), also have attractiveness go with them as well? LOL Good luck with that! It's kinda like ""you guys can be smart, but you can't be both smart AND attractive..that's probably not fair."" If that happens, USA will be dominated by Jews AND East Asians. Which Whites and Jews dont want. Think twice."
7202	294	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	I'm Vietnamese and people thought I was Chinese..... They still do...

7205	297	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	That weird moment when NOW you get comments on the comment you left like months AGO. The ocean of comments flows weirdly O.o

7214	306	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	I get so annoyed when black people say 'oh ur so white' or 'white music' or 'white people b like' and their excuse is 'who were the slaves of the 19th century' which is racist in itself because they're saying all white people had slaves and where cruel and black people were all innocent
7215	307	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	Almost all girls have an Asian fetish, it helps me out because people often mistake me for an Asian.

7220	312	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	_asian men aren't sexy_ *uhh hello BTS exists*
7221	313	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	WARNING ⚠️ RANT AHEAD: Ok. Kpop. It’s a lovely thing. Talented, talented young people. Singing, rapping, dancing, visuals. But this is racism against a whole race. The term “Asian” doesn’t simply extend to Koreans, Chinese people and Japanese people. Vietnam, The Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, just to name a few. And, sorry to break it to you, but South Asia consists of ASIANS. Mind blown right? We’re talking about India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and a few more. Asia is the biggest continent, and I hardly doubt that 51 M people live in that huge area. Just because Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis don’t look the same as your idea of a stereotypical Asian doesn’t mean we aren’t. And what about Vietnam and Thailand (to take but a couple) that most of the time don’t fall into a kpop, jpop, or anime fans view of an “Asian” country. To continue my long winded rant, I think talking about kpop and anime in this sort of situation is a little thoughtless. I mean, it’s all good and jolly if you aren’t Asian, but for the people who are (including me, as an Indian [and yes I am as Asian as you are, if you are Asian and are questioning me]) but for the people who are, this can be taken offensively. It’s like you’re packing Koreans and Japanese people into a huge, and I mean HUGE, box and naming it “Asians” and completely disregarding people from other countries. (Also, it sounds like you haven’t got a clue about this situation on the whole tbh, but that’s my opinion) Last point, I promise. This is just a personal comment, but, why would you compare anime characters to real life Asian? They are animated, made to look that way. The design of the characters is set out before hand. Unlike humans. Idrk lol, I was just wondering :”) P.S. I’m so sorry for this rant, it must have been really boring ^.^ P.P.S. Kpop fans- chill. I’m just a fan as you are. ~■-■
7222	314	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	But lets be honest here, Everyone else is hotter than asians... because no one is cooler than them yeah?
7223	315	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	What is n word
7224	316	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	Do you think blacks are attractive no. That’s horrible logic
7225	317	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	My fantasy love story since i was a child is to visit all East Asian countries n find my dream prince there....(btw i am South Asian...just clarifying since fr some damn reason only East Asians are considered Asians)...come on...just look at... Lee Min Ho Ji Soo Eugene BTS Kim Bum Kim Hyun Joong Sean Fujiyoshi RYAN HIGA!!!! There is nothing more i can say...

7229	321	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	Oh yes, yes we like asian men ♥️ Like you cutiepie
7230	322	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	why has society made it a horrible act to make fun of African Americans, but okay to make fun of asians. in my school if you make fun of an African American, latino, or white person for their race thats an automatic detention or suspension. But if an asian was made fun of in class the teacher would laugh and other students would call the asian sensitive for speaking up. A common argument for African Americans being treated better is that they’ve gone through more than asians. but does “struggle” have to earn respect? because the African Americans of our generation are left with a blessed life that their ancestors left for them. so no race in our era should use “struggle” as an argument. And asians deserve more respect, because society fucked up the story.
7231	323	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	Asian men are hot. Especially Koreans.

7268	360	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	Asians are proven to be the smartest race. That's why you have become a free target to other races. You are too intelligent to give into stupidity of racism. It's admirable that as a majority, you are above the comments pushed on to your race. The World would be a better place if everyone had that mentality.
7269	361	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPoOhgl1RQ	Every girl is attracted to KPop Guys nowadays

Yes, that does prove a point, I respect your thoughts and opinions, but don't forget the other Asian countries, like Vietnam, Mongolia, Laos, Pakistan, *etc* that have stunning people. Edit: Though it's been a while, I thought about responding to this. Just because I have an interest in Japanese related topics doesn't mean that I'm being 'salty' to (its apparently) the opposing country *cough cough* South Korea *cough*. That's an assumption.

7473	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4JsEhT_GA	Ryan is probably the most funniest you tuber without inappropriate stuff
7474	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4JsEhT_GA	For the people who are wondering why the quality is bad. Greg (his cameraman/ his friend) edited and sent him a test video (which is this video). Greg usually sends the test video with bad quality just to see if the editing is okay and the content is fine. Once Ryan is okay with the video, Greg ( I think) posts a better quality video. But Ryan accidentally posted the bad quality one.... Hopefully this makes sense
7475	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4JsEhT_GA	What's with the quality but the video is nice, I liked it. 👍

I wrote a rap song about a white guy trying to buy Christmas candy in a shawarma bar (inside joke; we both love candy and shawarma) Now I'm wondering, what if I made a similar poem to my dad as I did to my mom? Would that be considered sweet, or just awkward?"

7667	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjtP0BYOA6s	Is it JUST me or if I tell my dad I love him he just replies back he loves me too?
7668	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjtP0BYOA6s	It actually made me kinda sad hearing a lot of dads not just saying I love you back. Idk I feel like it's the result of our society telling men throughout their whole adolescence that you can't be sensitive. I'm not mad at the dads or anything Im just upset at how we let our young boys down.
7669	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjtP0BYOA6s	"I lost my dad recently and maybe this video is supposed to be funny but I can't stop crying. Please tell them ""I love you"" even if it's awkward. I never got to see him for the last time and tell him how much I love him."

7671	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjtP0BYOA6s	well apparently it's not just an asian dad thing! I can only remember one time my dad told me he loved me although I never doubted that he did. So I'm doing it differently. I tell my kids I love them often and give them lots of hugs and kisses. this video should move dads to get over it and just say I love you to their kids more often

7673	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjtP0BYOA6s	I love my dad. No matter what happens. Even if he is sick. Like what happened. He had colon cancer. He sadly died from it. When I found out ( my mom told me) I would cry nonstop. I cried for almost a week. But then I handled it a bit better. I looked back on stuff he gave to me and wrote to me. All of them were very special. And to this day and always. I love my dad!

Like, sometimes I have this scary feeling that one of my family the next morning, and you always read stories about kids who fought with someone they love, and that person dies the next day. I don't really think my family is going to die, but this is just to make sure you know .

I remember months ago when I joined your channel and watched a video where you spoke about your confidant about Harvey Barrett FX, who has been a fundamental part of your journey, I am happy I reached out to him like you suggested because his one on one crypto sessions has made me better. copying his daily cause of action, has helped me avoid mistakes and get better returns, thank you so much I also feel you should make more vids like that, it will help people know the right person to use to get a better one on one experience when the youtube videos are not enough to avoid getting scammed, make wrong moves and make better yields.

9559	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKEs1KjvBPM	I've had opera gx, a youtuber named Tech source recommended it so I love it since then
9560	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKEs1KjvBPM	The most terrifying park in the world was shut down. It's action park. They had skin scraping attraction. A wave pool that acted as a drowning pool that drowned several and demanded constant rescue and a lot of other things. It wasn't made to be dangerous. It was just very badly made and they decided to accept it and cover it up rather then fix anything
9561	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKEs1KjvBPM	I am from Germany and I was in this water parks too. They are AMAZING

9641	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Hey Guys, I think we've beaten this concept well past its death. It's more necrophilia now. Do you remember back when CollegeHumour put out videos that weren't just watchable, but hilarious? I'll have to remember those days to tell my grandchildren about.
9642	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Are the cast members seeing different things on the teleprompter that we’re not seeing on the news ticker? How did Trap and Ralph know to speak simultaneously and how the the fairgoers know they needed to improvise TEN food items?
9643	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	I would love to see Katie and Amy in an episode where it's their averaged scores against everyone else's 🤣🤣🤣
9644	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Katie is simply unbreakable. We need a “Katie Cannot Win” episode
9645	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	I have been here for 12 years and I have to say that this was the best one I ever seen ☺️☺️😳
9646	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	"I want to see the staff from College Humor do something like Rooster Teeth did with their ""Last Laugh"" show. Everyone in a room together, 3 lives each, you laugh you lose a life. Last person left wins."
9647	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	I love how Raph and Trapp deliver their lines. Colorful and enthusiastic. By contrast, while I know she's doing it for the game, Katie's mute unemotive deliveries aren't particularly interesting for me to watch, unless everyone else is freaking out.
9648	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Everyone: wow! Katie doesn't laugh! Me: wow! Anyone laughed at this.
9649	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Are these still being produced and released? Or is this just the back log from Dropout making it's way to youtube? I know that CH lost a lot of employees and Sam now owns the whole thing, I just don't know what content is actually new? I know they've been doing some animation stuff too
9650	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Lauren lapkus is a national treasure
9651	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	"""No Laugh"" Newsroom has a different connotation this time around, and I think it has something to do with how much of it was (IMPROVISE)."
9652	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Katie will never lose this game
9653	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	I live in the matrix and this is the proof. I watched your movie just yesterday on Netflix, Lauren! You were amazing! I’ve loved you ever since I saw you on Key and Peele, and have watched lots of your stuff on YouTube. Keep on being hilarious!
9654	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Pro tip: Never, NEVER play poker if Katie is sat at your table.
9655	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	"""It wasn't a ride and we were being taken."" That got a laugh out of me, at least."
9656	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Katie has no soul, so she will never be beaten at this game.
9657	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	I would love to see Katie laugh. Come on guys, do an episode where each of you toss out your favorite jokes. Get the woman laughing again!
9658	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Knew Katie was going to win. It's more fun to see how big the margin is. But this is what I live for. Some major heavy hitters! Really tight scores. Nobody hit double digits. Did not expect Raph in last place.
9659	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	"The ""me too"" smile earning a point for Raph doesn't seem fair. It's a reaction in-character to the remark, not grounds for a deduction"
9660	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Is there anything in this world that’ll make Katie smile. Like… ANYTHING
9661	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Katie may be good and all but it really does get boring after a while. I also think that if she acted and lived the character naturally more the bit would be funnier and more interesting, just like what everyone else is doing. She is just standing there as a robot from start to finish and with little to no expressions reading in a monotone voice, it sure does not sound interesting to me.
9662	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Waffle house, the home for people banned from Denny's. Waffle house, we're cheaper than a DUI!
9663	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Why do they keep bringing Katie? She's too competitive at this.
9664	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Katie has no soul. She never laughs.
9665	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Lauren Lapkus was a wonderful surprise guest! Love her work🖤
9666	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Boy, College Humor used to do nearly daily videos and now, it's just the breaking news segment once a month. Where did the time go? 😢
9667	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Katie is too damn good at this
9668	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Katie is a fucking pro.

9672	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Has Katie ever lost one of these
9673	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hEECLG_ZWA	Dunno how this got promoted in my feed. This is really really really unfunny.

9735	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	I feel personally attacked by this video. I have this cafe I used to go to alot, but stopped due to the coffee not sitting well with me. Not food poisoning or anything, just nausea and the occasionally need to throw up. Ive still gone a few times there to see if it stops, but so far nothing. It really sucks cause I love it there. So yeah. Im Theo

9739	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	How can ginger ale make you sick? This got way off track...
9740	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	Yeah but my favorite food makes everyone sick... Taco Bell!!!
9741	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	Maybe Tau is pregnant. Or is Katy pregnant? Every shot seems to be hiding her stomach behind a laptop, unusually high desk and bulky clothes.
9742	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	This reminds me of when I was a university student, living on a budget, and bought some cheese, my first cheese in awhile actually. It was delicious! But then I got pretty sick. Wow, must be some stomach flu going around, right? So I had a bunch more, in a delicious recipe I made up on the spot! Somehow I got sick, the same flu it seems! Weird. So, having an upset stomach, I don't really eat any more cheese for another week, at which point I remember that 'oh! I have that tasty cheese!' and go get some to eat. Well... This time I threw the cheese out while still sick. Because I would have ****ing eaten it again if I didn't, because I was a cheap moron that refused to believe that anything so delicious could be evil.
9743	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	That’s me eating McDonald’s chicken sandwiches for lunch 🥪 it makes me puke when I over eat 🤢 but I love eating fried chicken it’s delicious 😑

9746	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	It's so weird to see Katie be the sane one.
9747	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	At this point, if I only see Tao and Katie, it is definitely a boring sketch.
9748	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	"When reflected in a mirror, the ""Val"" part of Nasty Val's does spell out Lav so that might explain why Tao is perpetually suffering in the lavatory after consuming some of their food instead of Katie's theory that said food is actually poisoned."

9753	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzM_ab4bypY	Nasty Val's?There nasty in name. That bascially telling you that you will get food posioning. I surprise how that business didn't went out of business yet

9760	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	It’s funny how Katie never thought of “buy a car”
9761	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	there are 2 episodes Katie laughs. one you can on YouTube. the other is on dropout. it's pretty hilarious the whole bit.
9762	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	I love that CH is still making content buuuuut...can we bring back any other segments besides this one? How about the webcam segment from 2020? That was still wayyy better than what I've seen recently Or even the one where Brenden pretends to be a CEO. That still had some laughs last I knew. This one just feels like I'm watching a bunch of people play a party game...
9763	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Interesting seeing College Humor go the fine bros. route.
9764	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Thank you college humor. Today was really rough. This video really helped me take a breather and not take my own life.. from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for saving my life.
9765	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Katie is too OP, please nerf.
9766	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Mildly disappointed that after “buy a house” and “buy furniture for that house”, Katie didn’t continue listing off the things mentioned in “If I Had A Million Dollars”
9767	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	"Sad to see the only content they have made in the past 6 months is ""no laugh newsroom"""
9768	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	"The ""improv dildo defects"" is crying out for comment participation. - Ketchup dispenser prone to misinterpretation, jamming. - Overclocked vibrator sounds like crying. - Racism. - Actually a novelty crayon, causing problems in homes with small children. - Many, many lawsuits from Fred Rogers's estate. - ""Biodegradable"" - ""Make your own dildo"" kit not as much fun when it's Lego. - Insufficient lubrication causes clown honk. - Inflating to the sound of a lightsaber kinda cute; bursting and shrapnel less so. - ""Veterinary use only."" - Mislabelled bowling pin. - ""Requires 8 D batteries"" - Grant forgot to wash it."
9769	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Honestly, I want an episode where we have Katie and Amy in the same episode. That would be like an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object.
9770	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Cant wait till they make more skits rather than just breaking news all the time.
9771	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	can we get not the same content over and over again? dead channel.
9772	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Um, what? Are American hot dogs made from beef?
9773	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Is there a reason why Katie keeps being in these? She's a great in the cast and all but horrible for BNN. I dunno man, y'all keep doing you, ping me when the new Game Changer is out
9774	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	I feel like Grant wrote this script. Like I can hear him saying all of these lines.
9775	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	I feel like this is the first ep where the crew's laughter is just as audible as the casts when they break.
9776	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	The fact that Katie improved all of that without breaking Is insane
9777	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	God, this is just sad and unfunny
9778	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	"""That's MY line, you soulless worm."" That one killed me"
9779	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	I like this Kellen guy. Calls Katie a soulless worm when she yoinks his line and just breaks down when it gets stolen again.
9780	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Glad to see the AI robot that replaced Katie at birth is doing well and hasn't broken down yet.
9781	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Can we please get an episode where the writer explicitly tries to make Katie laugh?
9782	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Is it me or has Katie gotten alot better at these? I could have sworn when she started she was laughing all the time
9783	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Seeing Katie smile in the first few sec felt like it's a clickbait.
9784	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	I don't think the writers are trying hard enough to make Katie laugh.
9785	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Caught a new one
9786	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	One of WORST drinking games: Take a shot when Katie “laughs” in all of the episodes (hint, it’s only one… I think)
9787	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Is it time to call this a dead channel? They keep uploading this low effort, albeit funny, content. Last time they uploaded anything with effort was 6 months ago. Like cool, I'm glad you have drop out. But not everyone can support you on there.
9788	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Can't believe Katy wouldn't use her wall street fortune to find out who killed pat castles.
9789	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	"Please make a ""_____ Breaking"" compilation for each comedian, i want to watch 0 seconds of Katie."
9790	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Has Katie ever gotten a point?
9791	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	I can’t watch these. I’ve been waiting for this college humor phase to be over but…here we are….I might even unsubscribe and come back later
9792	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0xELMdGYeU	Haven’t watched college humor in a long time but glad to see you guys are still funny asl

9798	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Why is this showing up in my feed in 2021. Not upset tho, still makes me smile. Keep up the great work FD team
9799	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	In current times it has to be Ronaldo. The Greatest Of All Time. Surpassed the legendary Pele in goal tally. Is still fit at 35. Highest paid footballer for 2 years. Most popular sportsperson in the world. Moat charitable athlete in the world. Has been named player of the century till 2020. In football he can score with head and his both feet. He has bravery and the nature of not giving up till last minute. Messi on the other hand retired from international football on losing Copa America finals. Ronaldo is even the greatest player of his country while Maradona still is considered the best footballer from Argentina. CR7 has dominated in Spain. He has average of 1.07 goals for Real Madrid. While Messi has played for Barcelona since his debut and has 0.92. Not bad but lower than Ronaldo. Even Pele agrees that Ronaldo is the best in current time. The problem Messi has is no international trophy. Ronaldo has Euro 2016 and UEFA Nations league 2018. Messi has played finals 4 times and hasn't won any trophy. Goals scoring at international level is again ruled by Ronaldo. He has 0.62 goals per game while Messi has 0.56. Not far but still lagging behind. I agree Messi can dribble a lot better than CR7 but when it comes to goal scoring, athleticism and sportsmanship it is Ronaldo who rules. In short Messi is better but CR7 is the Best.
9800	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	This was released in 2011, but on the thumbnail it has the 2013 kits 🤔
9801	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	the fact this was 8 years ago and the debate is still going on just shows how lucky we have been too experience these players in the same era
9802	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Why did YouTube recommend this 😂
9803	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Here in 2019 and I'm still a cr7 fan boy

9806	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	In my opinion,both of these players are arguably the best in the world.Like if u agree!

9809	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	When this video was made it wasn't even close but Ronaldo has clawed his way back to parity. Legend
9810	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Messi is better by talent but ronaldo still better

9814	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Messi is a criminal who doesn't pay his taxes so Cristiano Ronaldo is the BEST!!

Before you shout ""selfish"" I want you to look at who leads the assists in La Liga. Before you say ""can't pass"" I want you to consider the fact that Ronaldo has more keypasses pr. game than Messi. Before you cry ""diver"" I want you to take a look at your own squad and the likes of Alves, Pedro, Neymar, Busquets etc. p.s- im a chelsea fan and i think they're both equal but ronaldo deserves more credit than he gets"

9903	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Ok, the debate between Ronaldo and Messi will never end, I will tell you at the end of this comment who I believe has done better, and who is the current best and who will become the best. The reason this will never end, is because there is always a counter argument, and new arguments start more counters. Ok, so here are the arguments and how fight back against them. All the counter arguments are true, I have spent hours on researching these two players. Fact 1: Messi has a higher goals per game ratio. Ronaldo counter: - Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more goals than Messi in his career - Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more goals than Messi in La Liga - Cristiano Ronaldo has scored some goals in the EPL, the hardest League to score in -(Supposed fact) Messi scores more goals per game because he has the best midfielders in the world assisting him: Xavi and Iniesta, this is why he doesn't score as many when playing for Argentina Messi's counter to Ronaldo's: -If Messi had played as many games, he would have scored more goals -Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more in La Liga only because he played there when he was his best, he wasn't scoring as much when he STARTED in Sporting CP and Manchester United - If Messi was in the EPL, he'd beat the defenders as well, as you can see in the Champions League. - Messi has Di Maria on his team, who is also a world-class assister Fact 2: Ronaldo is a winger, why is he scoring almost as much as messi? Messi counter: - His position says he is a winger, but he always shifts into the middle and always swaps wings - Why is Messi, a player who plays more of a striker in the centre-forward position giving more assists than Ronaldo? Fact 3: Ronaldo is the more complete player, as he can use his head more effectively, has a better weakfoot and uses skillmoves Messi's counter: - Messi is better at some things, Ronaldo may be the faster player, but on the ball, Messi is definitely faster. Messi is also a better dribbler and has better vision which he uses for key passes - Messi does not need skill moves, as he can use his dribbling and speed to get past Ronaldo - If Messi, someone who does not use his head much, has a weaker weakfoot, and does not use skill moves scores more goals per game than Ronaldo, then he clearly is better Fact 4: Fifa keeps sucking Messi's dick. There are no counter arguments for this one because it is true. At the world cup, Messi was clearly not the best player, yet they still decide to give him the best player award. Messi is on the cover of the past couple fifa editions. Fifa 15 supposedly rates players by their performances from the past 365 days. Last year, Ronaldo was clearly better, why is Messi still higher, but has been downgraded by 1 to become 93 and Ronaldo has not been been given an upgrade? That's because Fifa keeps sucking Messi's dick, supposedly, that is why Messi has won the Ballon d Or more. Fact 5: Messi is younger, he will become better than he is now and will clearly become better than Ronaldo. Ronaldo's counter: - By the looks of it, it does not seem Messi is getting better, but Ronaldo is. My Opinion: I believe Ronaldo and Messi are god-like players, there is no counter arguing against that, however, one of them has done better than the other, and for the future, I believe one of them will become better than the other. Who I believe has done better in their career: There is no doubt Messi has clearly done better, he has scored more goals per game, assisted more and would most likely pass Ronaldo's goal tally if he played as many games. He has won the Ballon d Or 4 times, and is more often perceived to be the better player. Who I believe is better now: This is more obvious than who has done better in their career. Ronaldo is currently killing it with back-to-back hatricks and doing more than Messi. Ronaldo has currently scored 17 goals in 11 league games, whist Messi has scored only 7 in 9 League games. Who I believe will be better in the future: This is clearly a prediction, I believe if Ronaldo keeps going by the looks of it, he will expand their gap between their goal tally, and win more Ballon d Or's and eventually become better than Messi. But we just have to wait and see. Thank you for reading this, as I spend so much time and effort in researching and trying to get this argument finished once and for all. There is no doubt that Messi and Ronaldo are phenomenal players, they are often compared, and I hope this comment will end the debate once and for all. -Yani

9927	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Messi, easily. Also, update the video.
9928	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Ronaldo can use the whole pitch. Messi stays in one area, Ronaldo can create more chances and chance the whole team. He can also get past people with out the assistance of other players. Messi on the other hand, can dribble the ball better than anyone else in the world, along with create great opportunities for his team to score goals.
9929	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	soccer not football
9930	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	I LIKE MESSI !!!
9931	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Messi is way better than Ronaldo. People will choose Ronaldo just because he's more famous.
9932	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Messi for Life. Whoever votes for Ronaldo is a noob
9933	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	One does not compare Messi to a human.
9934	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Messi would score 30+ goals in any League he is put in.
9935	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Those who know and understand football see this as comparing an apple to a pear. We have two different players here. Messi cannot be classed as a 'great footballer' as he is not a complete footballer where as Ronaldo IS a complete footballer. Therefore if one was to choose the World's current No1 footballer it will automatically and unarguably be Ronaldo, not Messi.
9936	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	thats because ronaldo played in EPL WHERELSE MESSI ONLY PLAYED IN LA LIGA
9937	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Messi is a far better player than C.Ronaldo.Just wondering,is Lionel Messi somehow related to Lionel Richie?3>0.Amen.

Asistencias incomparable si seguimos en ese sentido, efectividad 85 % contra 46% de Cristiano, digo no comparemos cualquier cosa
9943	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	As for 2013 Ronaldo for sure. Greatest player of all time (Only between Messi and Ronaldo) no doubt thats Messi because of his stats, records and trophies.
9944	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOToL-SSkKI	Messi is known above all for his dribbling skills,not even in dribbling he is better than CR7,Messi dribbles more often and is capable of dribbling more guys in a row but CR7's dribbles are much more classy,everything Cristiano does is more classy than what Messi does.

Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.[310][311] After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira.[312] In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre in his native island Madeira.[313] In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between the Primeira Liga club FC Porto and players from Madeiran based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.[314] In November 2011, Ronaldo donated a pair of his football boots to be auctioned by Real Madrid's 'Clasico' network. They were sold for £2050 with the proceeds going to fund schools in Gaza, Palestine.[315] In May 2012, Ronaldo and his agent, Jorge Mendes, decided to fund a pioneering treatment for a nine-year-old boy when it seemed that there was no hope left for the child, who has been battling cancer since before his second birthday.[316] In November 2012, Ronaldo sold the golden boot he had won in 2011 for €1.5 million and gave the money to fund schools for children in Gaza.[317] In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity.[318] In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia. The forum aims to raise awareness to the Indonesian and international community of the importance of conserving biodiversity and ecosystem of mangroves in the South Bay of Benoa, Bali.[

So Man United's win in the ECL Final should be in there.f

Often exposing insecurities and making elements of one's life vulnerable? I feel like I learned nothing in this video that I couldn't learn in a wikipedia article, and just proved to show how shallow this ass-hat really is.

10138	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	"""He is fat, he is round, he got payed ten million pound"" Winston Bogarde should be number one and he is not even on this list? I know he was free but at the time they signed one of the worlds best defenders at 50k a week (Megamoney back then) and he just packed it in on day one and after 4 appearances in 4 years costing 2.5 million each he said ""Chelsea offered me the contract, i signed it, I dont see the problem."" I dont see the problem lmao, he was carrying about 15 kilo's overweight"
10139	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	how come kaka and torres be the worst transfer
10140	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	No dought that Torres wasn't the player he was for Liverpool at Chelsea. But the goal against Barcelona in the Champions League alone was worth the money spent on him...
10141	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Liverpool is the dumbest football club in the world when it comes to player buying.
10142	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Hmmm, its funny I don't see Arsenal on here, ohh wait! we don't pay big money for flops.
10143	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	where is di maria and falcao??
10144	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Torres wins the champions league for Chelsea, gets claimed as a flop lmao. Good thing hes back at home in Atletico with no hate.
10145	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Kaka is good you know!!
10146	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Schweinsteiger to Manchester United! Hes might have gotten a legend if he just had stayed in Bayern!
10147	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Gareth Bale, as expenseve as he wa unknown when they bought him. The most overrated player for his value and still far from lived up to the price. But what can you do when you have a teammate who happens to be a completely dominant Ronaldo... Bale isn't even important for them.
10148	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	HOW THE HECK IS KAKA ONE OF THE WORST TRANSFERS?
10149	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	what about the guy from Newcastle (cant remember his name) that went to Real Madrid and got declared by a sports magazine as the worst transfer in history?
10150	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	6 of them aren't flops!
10151	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	That twat Ancelotti, who bought Torres for 50 million, really needs a brain transplant.
10152	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	3. Fernando Torres 2. Andy Carroll 1. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Inter to Barcelona.
10153	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	The fact that 4 of these are players that were transferred to Liverpool just conveys that Liverpool needs to change their transfer policy and committee. Fucking annoys me how much we waste!﻿
10154	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	What About Van persie?
10155	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	what about Gareth Bale from spurs to Real Madrid for 81 Mil
10156	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Torres was ruined in Chelsea
10157	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Liverpool is a flop himself
10158	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	what about ibrahimovic to barcelona?
10159	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Torres welcome A.C Milan
10160	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	I know this was made in 2013 but, if it were made right now number one would be chicharito to madrid
10161	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	James Rodriguez will be on the next video. :p
10162	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	if this was made this year Lamela, Soldado, Fellaini, and Neymar would be in it
10163	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	WHY IS KAKA HERE ??? O.o
10164	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	"Nando's best years were in Liverpool. I don't know why he flopped at Chelsea - is it cause he's unhappy, is it because of a loss of confidence, lack of good partnership or what but he's just not the same. He has lost what made him special. So maybe consider going back or moving on, otherwise the last 3+ years will turn into 10 years of mediocre ""achievements""."
10165	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	IMO Torres is the worst.
10166	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	c.ronaldo? Garet bale?
10167	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	How can you put Kaka I just can't get this
10168	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	where is Bale to Madrid?
10169	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	HOW IS TORRES A BAD TRANSFER THATS BS
10170	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Torres was a far worse signing than Carroll Carroll cost 35 Million and was sold for 17 million so 18 million loss Torres cost 50 million and wont be sold for more than 10. (plus he's on insane wages) The thing which really makes Torres the worst signing was that he was one of if not the best striker in the world at Liverpool but at Chelsea he has become awful, i mean seriously as a liverpool fan I loved torres and when he went to Chelsea I worried he was going to score goals galore but I have never seen a player regress so badly. At least carroll was always crap haha. Also Aquilani ? seriously he is not in the top 10 worst transfers of all time even for the premier league. He was injured mostly but was a good player just couldnt adapt to the premier league. Sold for 10 million pounds loss not that bad. Downing on the other hand is the definition of a flop, truly awful player.
10171	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Veron was a great player. why did it not work out for him at Man U??
10172	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Actually Kaka to Real Madrid was a good idea but until Mourinho came
10173	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	looks like liverpool is quite good in flops
10174	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	He he Liverpool buys all the garbage :)
10175	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Torres one of the worst? Maybe for Liverpool, lol....but all he did at Chelsea was dethrone Barca and then scored an amazing goal in the CL finals to help Chelsea win. No big deal, right?
10176	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Why is Shevchenko on there?
10177	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Poor Liverpool.
10178	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Fernando Torres was the best transfer of all time <3
10179	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	At least Torres is performing well now... But EA screwed him on FIFA by making him slow... He still has his pace!
10180	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	I honestly believe that Torres hasn't actually been bad at Chelsea
10181	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Fuck u. Torres goal against barca worth 100m
10182	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Liverpool dont know buy
10183	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Kaka was bad because he hardly got to play!
10184	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Robbie keane and kaka weren't that bad
10185	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	The worst transfer flop was Ibrahomovic from Milan to Barca in world record fee 59£ following Ronaldo and Bale
10186	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Torres??? You are stupid
10187	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	How is Torres bad thats crazy he was bad last 2 years with us but not know
10188	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Where is Berbatov to Man Utd??
10189	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	basically Liverpool transfer+few more
10190	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	torres wasnt a waste
10191	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	Why is Veron here he was one of the best midfielders in man utd?
10192	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwxXjbYoUI	torres is amazing, just cause he doesn't score as many as he did at liverpool doesn't mean he's shit. look at his stats in the last few seasons, how many assist and goals he's scores even in international games he's scored so many, that and the amount of tittles he's won, he was worth 50m when he was at liverpool, just cause he doesn't score as many doesn't mean he's worthless

But we will only learn about it in gossip news and what not, because the sport is always the most important than some lame celebrities

The stands are starting to fill in.... A drop dead gorgeous, 20ish Asian woman, wearing a pink dress, with the hem line at mid-thigh, wearing a pushup bra and putting on quite a show, walks down the stairs, out of the shadows into the light... When she starts to side shuffle to reach her seat directly behind Jack, the entire place sees her and starts applauding, whistling, cheering, etc..... Just when every guy's tongue was scraping the floor..... Jack stands up and jokingly takes a bow, as if the cheering was for him. The whole place erupted in laughter !! The young woman blushed and quietly sat down ! Classic Jack!

10708	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	So basically LeBron just contradicted himself, he was on twitter yesterday bashing other athletes for practicing moves they never even use in-game..
10709	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Jesus Loves Yall and is the way to Everlasting Life 🤍
10710	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	When LeBron thought KD was his friend
10711	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	If only team USA used that move today :(
10712	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Been 8 years, still waiting for him to use this move …
10713	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Lmfaooo too bad it didn't win him 8 championships
10714	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	But what about the move that made lebron cry?
10715	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	He has to use this in game before he retires, if he does that would be legendary
10716	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	lebron = class clown mj = class bully
10717	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	anyone here in 2021 Its been 8 years And he still hasn't used the move once
10718	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	But but how Did he score That seriously...😂😂😂
10719	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	still UNSTOPPABLE!!1!!😤👑💪🏾#KINGJAMES

10722	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	This is an illegal move. Idk why ppl think they were being serious. Yall clearly dont know the rules 🤦‍♂️
10723	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	You mean LeBron's travelling... Fundamentals mean nothing in today's game. He is an all-time great but comparing his skill level to MJ, Kobe, Bird and co. is absurd.
10724	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Can any baskerball players explain why it is unstoppable?
10725	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	he predicted everyone doing up and unders in 2020, the real goat

10737	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Hasn't Been patched yet
10738	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Hakeem could pull that off
10739	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	He traveled 😂
10740	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	You have a legend in the number 6 jersey. Then you have a little bitch and traitor in number 5.
10741	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Why everyone so damn salty? all they doing is having some fun damn
10742	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Finally, we have the solution on how to beat the warriors
10743	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Can tell he didn't go to college😅
10744	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	he should have used that against biyombo.
10745	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	I'm right hand and I use my left to fake and right to lay it in and it's difficult than my exams

10749	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	I thought his unstoppable move is traveling
10750	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	KD did it better only if he made it
10751	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	LeBron throws the ball in his offhand like it was nothing.
10752	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	0:02 that laugh tho
10753	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Still waiting on him to use this move in the game lol.
10754	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	lmao he traveled
10755	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Signature moves Jordan-spin move Kobe-buzzer beater LeBron-all of his moves are signature!
10756	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Of course Lebron travels..
10757	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	it's so hard to tell if that's a travel or not
10758	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Is that James Harden laughing in the beginning? Lol
10759	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	i see kevin durant coming to cleveland in a year or two
10760	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Look at how easily he holds the ball in his hands. lol Guys hands are probably massive.
10761	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	I don't understand why lebron has so much hate
10762	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	So Lebron jokes around during practice and all hell brakes loose. Haha...
10763	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	If you look closely LeBron flopped
10764	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	An ad longer than the actual video, u fuckin serious!?
10765	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	I love finding out how many people that love watching Lebron's clips have probably never touched a basketball. 0 out of 3 were travels. He keeps his pivot foot the same and on the ground the entire time. KD is the one that switched the pivot. Try going outside for once and maybe you will learn to appreciate sports.
10766	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	NBA players signature moves: Jordan- Turnaround Fadeaway Iverson- Killer Crossover KAJ - Sky Hook Lebron- The Travel
10767	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	he travelled...but haha ye would be funny to see lebron pull this one of in a real game! maybe the all star game!
10768	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Hahaha! Durant couldn't figure it out.
10769	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	God damn. He shoots hook shots with his off hand like it's nothing.
10770	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	"The funniest part is that James's doesn't really have any signature/go-to moves...that's why he can't win close games....he passes the ball instead and call it the ""right play."""
10771	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	1, 2 and pivot how simple is that, it took me 10 secs to realize it wasn't a travel
10772	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Why he got hyperdunks on??
10773	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	The first one is a travel, he pulls the ball up before he plants his pivot foot. Other ones would never be called in the NBA. Only thing he does wrong is slide his pivot foot a little.
10774	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Say all I got to say is that ain't nobody a real LeBron fan I have all his jerseys and his shoes
10775	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	That's an unstoppable move for H.O.R.S.E
10776	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	IT'S NOT A TRAVEL. When HE LIFTS HIS PIVOT FOOT THE BALL IS ALREADY OUT.
10777	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	this wasn't a travel you idiots. do any of you guys even play basketball? its called a pivot foot. don't comment if you haven't picked up a ball and played lol you're just making yourself look dumb
10778	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Pause it by 0:02, there is 1, 2 , 3, 4 steps that is a travel, is the referee blind or what? unbelievable that finals versus OKC was rigged
10779	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	If you said he traveled you don't know basketball
10780	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Who cares if its travel? Its hard to notice it and refs NEVER call it
10781	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	Its not a travel you dumbasses. He could do it in a game because he gathered and then kept his pivot
10782	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	"I agree with you Dylan. I wonder how many of those individuals who say he traveled are NBA Refs. Enjoy the shot for what it is"" UNSTOPPABLE""if one has ever played pickup without a REF."
10783	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	"why is everybody talking about ""it's a travel"" or ""it's inaccurate"".. he was joking.. some people just take this video too serious"
10784	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	I'm still waiting for him to do this in game.
10785	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	his hairline is the most unstoppable move
10786	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	"Yeah that really is Lebron's best move, its called a ""travel"""
10787	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	That is actually unstoppable you would have to laugh mid way through losing all concentration
10788	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoDKtzjLS9k	lmao

10815	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psyCXr9uqaQ	Harmony Korine directing this should also be in the title tbh. That makes this collab 20 times cooler if you’re not familiar with KIDS or Gummo you should be. Dude got banned from David Letterman for being too eccentric he’s a legend

10861	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	That's a stupid name for a dog.
10862	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	Seriously though, why represent depression as an animal? Animals are sentient beings, not mental illnesses.
10863	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	My therapist showed me this. Helped a ton!
10864	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	I now have no one I'm close to. I lost both of my parents and my friends are sick of my sadness. What can I do now? Can anyone tell me how to act happy cuz they constantly ask me to change my attitude but it seemed impossible to me and they never understand!!
10865	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	Seriously? A dog? If for anything you want to name or blame your illness..it is everything but a dog..
10866	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	What a great and beautiful video!!! God, it's all so true, reminds me of just how tired I am now of all this suffering, it really takes it out of you!!! Thank you so much for this!! X
10867	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	WTF ... Whats with the 'Black Dog' Why couldn't the dog be 'White' this is more stereo typical racism anything that is wrong in the world has to be 'Black' when we all know that 'White' is where most of the worlds problems originate from like the USA government the UK government the Russian government White, White, White, ... When the world and countries are oppressed it is always oppressed by 'White' not Black ... BTW I didn't realise that the new 'Black' is Grey! ... Tbh it's actually quite accurate that all ills proceed from the 'Grey Man' aka 'White Man' ... And before you KKK lovers come at me I think I'll let you into a secret ... I AM WHITE!!!
10868	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	Thanks for the video. I would like to note that using BLACK as equal to BAD has negative race connotations. With all due support to the creator of this video, it is disappointing to see it adopted by WHO, a global organization bound by the United Nations principles. I hope that the organization we hold high, respect and count on revises its messaging and filters third-party messages carefully before adopting them. Thank you.
10869	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	I have a black dog and I told my friends about it thinking this would be helpful but I kidda regret it rn because everytime I'm w them now I feel like they are judging me. The inner know that they are not but I'm still scared. I'm scared they bring the subject, asking if I'm getting better bc I'm not. I know nobody cares but I'm just leaving this comment here. Fighting!
10870	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	R.I.P Kim Joghyun, I am here trying to understand his suffer... I hope he’s at a better place now🌹🖤Love you, KJ thank U dfor everything!!!miss u so much
10871	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	The black dog (depression) has a sibling. He tends to hang around me. He is named anxiety. And sometimes, he attacks me out of nowhere. It brings me to the ground and worries people. They ask what's wrong, but I never have a straight answer. I asked for help. But never got it. Anxiety hasn't been beaten yet, but maybe he will someday. But all in all, that's wishful drinking. And in my case, all you need is a friend to try and help hide the feelings. But things won't always go your way. When a friend can't help, I just have to remember that alcohol was always there for me. It drowns the dog. Leaving me with an even more depressed black dog. I try to drown him too but it doesn't really work. It only makes it worse. Depression tries to get revenge sometimes, and attacks me. But his brother somehow always comes back. So I try again. But that's what I'm worried about. And I'm not paying mind to the other problems forming. Eventually the problems get so bad, I give up. The only answer seems to be a knot hanging from the ceiling. Or a gun in my hand. Or pills in my gut. But their will always be a friend. To help you along. They might not realise it, but they could call themselves heros. They saved your life, and you don't know how to repay then besides do something you haven't done in a long while and.... Smile.
10872	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	dont understand the analogy with the dog!! i dont like it ...
10873	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	when you can't exercise and medication and therapy doesn't work. what do you do then????
10874	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	the only thing that can make me forget about depression is weight training. if I wouldnt be physically active I would not even get out from bed
10875	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	All very good !! But IM NOT AFRAID TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT MY BLACK DOG!!!! I WOULD ASK FOR HELP BUT ALL I GET IS PLAMED OFF. I have no help whatsoever from my GP, they eventually gave me 3 sessions of 'counselling' which was as uselfull as a chocolate hot water bottle. Eventually they send me on a course to treatment over 16 weeks. I get to the first session to be told the local council have cut the funding!! I have tried the Samaritans, useless, patronising, 4 councilors of which I have had to pay a considerable amount of money and all I do is regurtitate my life story. The found another charitable trust who get no funding from the government, they are highly recxomended but again after spending nearly £250 on a handful of sessions, again, I come out and walk away feeling totally let down. The only thing I have been given is pregablin for anxiety if have been on this for over 8 sodding years with no real discussion with the GPS in terms of how to revue it. I'm on Certalone ....useless!!

It gets very sad, and truly difficult to overcome negative habits in such unffair world. Considering that everyone that post a comment had or have a black dog in his life, i think it would be a great idea to make a group or facebook or something like that (everyone-free-to-join) to talk about what makes us feel so unhappy, at least the only ones who understand this state of mind are the ones experimenting same feelings."
10879	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYc	"The World Health Organization, a well-respected and revered group of professionals, has decided to pair depression to... a black dog. Is this a joke??? The expression ""offended"" doesn't even touch how I feel after watching this attrocity comparing depression to a black dog. I have a black dog. I also have had family members and friends lose their lives to depression. Comparing the two is...ridiculous. Whoever spent the time to ""inspire"" those suffering from depression has NO idea."

Because vaccines disrupt the immune system, disabling it's natural detoxification processes, thus making the vaccinated age faster. Vaccines are a fantastic way to reduce pension plan burden. Another interesting facet of their disgusting and infuriating HYPOCRISY: Pfizer is NOT mandating THEIR employees to get the jab!! What does that tell ya?? (If you can still THINK FOR YOURSELF!!!) The simple answer is that we live under corporate fascism now. It will be Marxism within a year, and Communism within two. Better rise up now. ""COVID"" is communism hiding behind a fake medical issue. All this for a virus with a 99.5% or greater survival rate. A virus so bad that most people have to be tested to find out if they have it! You’re right it’s about control, and also a big distraction over all of the other BS going on."

Earthquake activity has also increased and continues to increase. The Bible tells a totally different story to what the scientists are saying that climate change is caused by human activity. In Matt 24 Jesus prophesied certain end-time events. and also in Rev 6 ""The four horsemen of the apocalypse"". Matt 24, and Rev 6 are exactly the same events. Google, and read. Rev6:5 which concerns the pale horseman...Then you decide for yourself whether or not COVID19 is an act of God... as was the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah...I decided that Covid 19 is an act of God... But also, It's not just the pale horse that is in motion, so is the White Horse, the Red Horse, and the Black Horse."

But, I STILL MANNED UP AND GOT MY SHOTS. YOU SHOULD TOO. I don't care HOW LOAN WOLF or REBEL WITHOUT A CLUE YOU ARE. EVERY SIX MONTHS THEY STICK ME AND TAKE MY BLOOD FOR MY PREP MEDICATION.

10927	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0ZabxXmH4Y	Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses and governments faced the need to solve multiple, competing priorities simultaneously. One of the toughest: how to keep an economy going while at the same time shutting it down to protect citizens from infection. As some regions emerge from the worst of the health crisis, it’s tempting to think that there could be a return to focusing on just one main concern. But this week, McKinsey experts examined sectors, particularly defense and national infrastructure, where solving for dual imperatives is more important than ever...

I can barely remember the last time I was sick, and that's only partially due to Covid time distortion.

If they took it from a bat, re-engineer it, with the technology today, they could have made it look like it came from the animal. Like really! If I was an evil person or just an evil scientist, I'm sure that I could find a way to make it look like it came from the animal, so I wouldn't get caught. Is it funny how many outbreak China had, “1957-1958 – H2N2 originated in China. 1968-1969 – H3N2 originated in China. 1997-2004 – H5N1 originated in China. 2003 – SARS originated in China. 2006 – Bird Flu originated in China. 2009 – Swine Flu originated in China. 2013 – Porcine Pestivirus originated in China. 2019 – Covid-19 originated in China.” May I also point out that the world paid the price for China negligent. How do we know that all these outbreaks wasn't intentional. China, keep proving that they are irresponsible country, and every time China gets really bad, the world has to pay for it. I believe that China is willing to sacrifice a small amount of it's population in order to make bigger damage to other countries. In addition, isn't another coincident that virus that came from China, while Canada has their CEO of Huawei 5G is in custody at the United State request for crimes 2 yrs now. China eats’ and destroys everything they touch. I don't know about you, but these are a lot of red flags. Therefore, here is the real question, ""How many people in the world need to die before we hold a country responsibility?"" Apparently, 3.86 million people’s death is not enough to hold a country liable for their death."

You recognize them by the dress, they are the ones with the mask, the gloves and the shirt My thanks go to them and I think of them at all times You are small hidden and evil Even if you were created you will not be forgotten We want to live we will continue to smile. …………………………………………… by Marco Baruffaldi down boy who sings against bullying SUBSCRIBE TO MARCO BARUFFALDI'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL

All you can do is wake up others. 🤔🤔 It's about promoting the sheep follower to their puppet leader⚠️☠️⚠️ DON'T LET THEM FOOL YOU‼ ️ Wake up!!! ‼️ Seek spiritual discernment‼️ What they are doing is very evil ‼️ 💉💉💉🐑⬅️2m➡️🐑⬅️ ‼️Dr. Fauci and some other ‼️corrupted‼️ government and leaders ‼️like George Soros are part and owners ‼️of the‼️ pharmaceutical ‼️‼️industry!!!‼️ ( Like Pfizer....

Symptoms appear from the third day after infection (viral symptoms) It is important to count the number of days that symptoms occur. Phase I (1st, 2nd, 3rd day) Body aches Eye pain Headache Vomiting Diarrhoea Nose or nasal congestion Decomposition Burning of the eyes Burning when urinating Feeling feverish Sore throat Be careful, it is very important to drink fluids, especially pure water. Phase 2; (4th to 8th) Loss of taste and/or odour Fatigue with minimal effort Chest pain Tightening of the ribs The difference between fatigue and shortness of breath - Shortness of breath is when a person sits without any effort while sitting; Fatigue is when a person gets tired of trying to do something simple. Covid-19 binds oxygen, so the quality of the blood is poor and oxygen is depleted. Stage 3 - Healing On the 9th day, the healing phase begins and can last until the 14th day (healing). Do not delay treatment, the sooner the better. It is better to keep these recommendations, Sit in the sun for 15-20 minutes Rest for at least 7-8 hours. Drink one and a half litres of water a day All food should be hot (not cold). • Keep in mind that the pH of the coronavirus ranges from 5.5 to 8.5. So all we have to do to get rid of the virus is to eat more alkaline foods than the acid level of the virus. Banana, Lime → 9.9 pH • Yellow Lemon → 8.2 pH Avocado - pH 15.6 Garlic - pH 13.2 • Mango - pH 8.7 Mandarin - pH 8.5 Pineapple - 12.7 pH Orange - 9.2 pH How do you know if you have Covid-19? Itchy throat Dry throat Dry cough High temperature Difficulty breathing Loss of smell and taste Do not keep this information just for you, give it to your family and friends.

Scientifically, viruses were discovered as such as around the last quarter of a century of the 19th century ... out of nothing in 1818 ... perception by knowledge changes the interaction of phenomena experienced in a visible way over time, we cannot remain a single spectator of the experiment

11007	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0ZabxXmH4Y	This is all accurate information
11008	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0ZabxXmH4Y	Naproxen Sodium is Antiviral !!!! ( Just Google : Is Naproxen Sodium Antiviral ? ) Naproxen Sodium ( Aleve ) has been scientifically proven in 2012 to be Antiviral against Influenza A- H1N1 ( the Spanish Flu ; which killed 675,000 out of the 108 million American population, in four waves in 1918 & 1919 ) and also Influenza B. Naproxen Sodium has been scientifically proven to blocked the only 2 viruses it was tested against from bonding with RNA and replicating. As of April 2020, scientist are testing and trying to repurpose Naproxen Sodium, so it can be proven to be useful and used in fighting the Coronavirus. But by the time it's scientifically proven to be also Antiviral against the Coronavirus it will be to late, ; because if the Coronavirus is EVEN as contagious and deadly as Influenza A - H1N1 The Spanish Flu , 1.5 million Americans will probably die ,the US Economy will be in ruin worse than The Great Depression ; not to mention all the fear, anxiety and loss of quality of life due to the USA's reaction to the Coronavirus. Why isn't anyone in the Media , Government , or Medical Community talking about using Naproxen Sodium as at least a possible reactionary weapon against respiratory viruses like the common cold,Season Flu and even the Coronavirus ?

Live-animal markets (wet markets) sell live and dead animals and exist all around the globe, with more than 80 in New York City alone. At these markets, the cages are stacked one over another. Animals at the bottom are often soaked with all kinds of liquid. Animal excrement, pus, blood. Such conditions allow viruses to spread from one animal to another as well as to humans who come into contact with them. All such markets are potential breeding grounds for zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19, SARS, and MERS.

11033	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tv2BVN_WTk	So you pull up to a store put on a mask ( the same one you were wearing for the last week) walk into the store. contaminate your hands, adjust your mask 15-20 times. that's a natural thing to do. walk out of the store pull your mask off. Your contaminated Walk around Walmart. people wearing mask below the nose. pulled down. punching credit cards one right after the other. Why are these people not ending up in the hospital. and how do they keep employees? They should all be getting contaminated.
11034	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tv2BVN_WTk	ok i you still think that mask actually slow down the transmission of Covid19..... Try this. Go outside when its 30f outside. Put on your mask and breath normally. And you will see for yourself that tons of visible moisture goes through and around your mask, even if worn correctly.
11035	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tv2BVN_WTk	no evidence that any of this works

11044	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tv2BVN_WTk	You have to promote mask wearing. It's not life long. You must wear it until pandemic recedes. Individual liberty doesn't allow you to harm society and spread rumours. Don't be rumour monger. Be a responsible citizen.

11068	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tv2BVN_WTk	"Here is an "" *IMO PSA* "" ... You're better off using *cold* water than hot. The level of heat required to sanitize will not be coming out of your faucet. Even if it did, you would not be able to hold your hands under such heat for long enough. Cold water can be obtained through the tap, and will slow the growth of cells. Also, *2 meters* ( _the minimum_ ) for social distancing, not one. It's my opinion that storing the mask in a sealed air-tight bag (like a ""ziploc"") is a _bad_ idea. That provides a stable moist environment for cellular growth. I believe that storing it in a heavy (sturdy, thick, etc) paper bag is a *much* better procedure. After thoroughly cleaning the mask with soap and water, rinsing it, and letting it air dry (or putting it in the dryer with your other laundry), put the mask in the paper bag and close the bag well by rolling or folding up the opening. Store it in a cool dark place (perhaps in a basement cupboard if available). This will allow the bag to absorb moisture from the mask, inhibiting the growth of nasties. If you have any of those desiccant packets (the little packets of sandy stuff that say ""DO NOT EAT"" that come with some products to keep them dry) then I would put them in the bag as well, to further reduce moisture. Remember, the three vital elements for germs to grow: *Moisture* , *Warmth* , *Food* (""food"" being virtually anything organic)."

11098	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"8 years old me to my siblings: ""Can you see that""?"
11099	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	All my questions answered, but one... when you push your eyes in, and close them, after a while, it gets really trippy, and the blue sky sprites appear but don't move, and when you stop and open your eyes, everything is dark, then vision slowly returns. Once I did this all night involuntarily with the way i slept, and when i woke up, i thought i went blind. (I was 6 btw)
11100	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	i have 5 small one in my left eye, and 1 big one in my right eye, but most of the time you won't notice them
11101	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Something about this seems like a lie !!!
11102	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	while watching this vid i was seeing floaters SHEEEESH-
11103	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Naw we are under water 💧 n it’s the water glistening
11104	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I legit thought that I could see atoms. I thought I had somthing sooo special that the government would kidnap me and do tests on me. Thanks.
11105	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Do they go away tho
11106	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I have a question. When I open my eyes in a dark room, I see very tiny dots that are red, blue or green in general. Is something wrong with my eyes?
11107	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought all this days my eyes are seeing Air and I'm having superb eyes 👀
11108	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	me: thinking I had floaters because I had bad vision me after watching this video: I knew it, I don't have bad vision
11109	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	فقط سبحان الله سبحان الخالق العظيم اما الملاحدة الجاحدين لعظمة الخالق فاللعنة عليكم
11110	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	They keep lagging going down and up
11111	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	But that means that the eye is actually capable of looking at things all the way down to cell level right?
11112	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Thank you for this ...I always thought it's just me.. bcoz I couldn't explain to others what I m seeing😅
11113	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Ok so why do I see colors when I rub my eyes too hard or when I stand up too quickly???
11114	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	After 13 years, it is finally answered.
11115	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I realized I had this, I thought it was some form of abnormality that would cause serious eye issues later on. Worse, I didn’t even know how to describe it to anyone; little did I know it’s a common phenomenon. Knowledge is truly power!!
11116	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I saw this video I was so delighted to see it because I have been seeing these floaters all my life everytime I look out the window into the the sky. And these floaty things were so fun because I used kind of play around with them by blinking my eyes and looking up and down. I always thought they super weird and super random though. I never really asked anyone about it because I thought they'll think I am being weird but I knew this probably happened for everyone and there would definitely be a scientific explanation for it and here its is! Sorry for the life story TedEd, I just go so excited about this.
11117	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	This is so damn relieving, I've been seeing trails of light for so long and have been so worried it would've been a terrible thing, but it's actually somewhat interesting to see what this actually is!
11118	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was a kid I used to tell everyone that if I placed one of those into some people, they would die in a few hours. My super power hahaha ultimately I started thinking that they was caused by the sun and according to this, I wasn’t all that wrong
11119	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"I always called them ""angel hair"" when I was a child because I mostly saw them when I looked up in the sky"
11120	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	thought it was spirits, i be seeing hella floaters when im at the beach
11121	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I always thought that it is some sort of special power that god has gifted me
11122	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When i was small, i used to look at the sky and these floaters popped up out of nowhere. So anyway i just thought of them as a dinosaur or an airplane and used to drift them across the sky
11123	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I have the second condition . So back in the sixtes when I went to elementary school when they had eye exams I told them about what I was seeing, yeah they had me in for a few more test not vision related either.
11124	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I have seen them multiple times, but always thought the were my imagination
11125	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	This is a blessing from the algorithm for me
11126	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I used to imagine my brain would get a box of toys and were throwing it into my field of vision😂
11127	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought my eyes were so good I could see dust floating
11128	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I saw them when I was a kid and wanted to focus on them. They always moved, so I tried to look away and turn my eyes quickly towards them to get them in my line of sight.
11129	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	And I thought I was the one with this superpower to see the molecules🤣😛
11130	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was 7, I could literally see snakes and lizards just beside me in my bed although I knew they never existed.
11131	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"""ooo i used to have them, now i dont think i have anymore"" observes for less than 2 seconds ""nevermind, there they are"""
11132	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	when i close my eyes and concetrate, i start to see blue rings closing in and then another one closes in forever and ever
11133	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	i’m tired of seeing my blood cells whenever i look at the sky
11134	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	“Oh squiggly line in my eye fluid, I see you there lurking on the periphery of my vision.” -Stewie Griffin
11135	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"I typically only see them when I look at a somewhat ""dim"" fluorescent light. No wiggles or various shapes - just very tiny clear ""hotdog"" shaped things."
11136	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I was always curious about these things that I saw every time when I used a microscope. Thank you!
11137	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"My Dad And Mom laughed at me whenever I said that ""I saw microorganisms in sky"" when I was 7 years old 😝"
11138	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	“But they’re not alive”…continues to animate them with blinking eyes.
11139	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I use to love unfocusing my eyes as a kid and watching these 'floaters' move about.
11140	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When i was child I asked this question about somethings are floating in my eyes, literally. Nobody could understand and explain me. Thanks TED-Ed :)
11141	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	The liquid in your eyes came from your mothers placental fluid. Those “floaters” are from her❤️
11142	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Just scrolling through the most popular Ted Ed videos… and I found the answer I needed, but wasn’t looking for at the time. Thank you Ted Ed for answering many of my weird questions at the perfect time. Thank you.
11143	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Now I can die peacefully. Thank you!
11144	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	always wanted to know what it was
11145	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	when i was younger, i thought i was the only one seeing them
11146	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I've always been curious about this. Finally I know it, thank you so much Team Ted.
11147	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was younger I had floaters almost every day and I thought that those were big bacteria on my eyes
11148	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was little, And my parents were driving I used to play games with the floater. A sort of flappy bird game.
11149	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	“They may seem alive and change shape but they are not alive” Me: *calms
11150	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Weird, I've seen the blue field entoptic phenomenon but not when looking at a blue sky. Just randomly.
11151	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought I was seeing God in my childhood , I feel weird now
11152	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	This was exactly what I was wondering about just hours ago. Then I see this video recommended by yt. Niceee. Gotta say though, I thought the reason for it is all light, no other factors lol 😂
11153	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I saw the blue sky sprites before and I thought I was going insane XD Thank you TedEd
11154	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Dang, getting to see up close what we’re made of! What a blessing, God’s so cool!
11155	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	It was haunting me.Now it’s clear that I'm not a lunatic. Those floating things are really exist.
11156	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	What about the random shapes and colors when pressure is on a closed eye?
11157	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	So basically you’re looking into things in your own eyes
11158	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	They used to..
11159	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Why no one here talks about the flashes (they usually appear after quite sudden movements)?! It was so magical back then that I stood there frozen till it's gone and attached a special meaning to their appearance... 🖖💙☄️🙄
11160	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	YES I THOUGH NO ONE ELSE NOTICED THIZ
11161	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I love how amazing Biology is ❤️
11162	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	You can actually learn to move them using your eye. I love to watch them whenever they show up(pretty rare). Now I know what they are, thanks
11163	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was a kid, I used to think that these were oxygen atoms🙈
11164	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was a kid I thought my eyes were unique and that I am actually a human microscope! I told my parents about those flying stuff I see and they ignored, when I was 15, I was still able to see them and actually started thinking I’m either sick or haunted, until that one day I made a whole research about this weird phenomenon and found out that what I am seeing is actually WBCs! I told my bio teacher she laughed at me and so the kids in the class! I printed and wrote the research and got her so many resources and she apologized for making fun of me cuz I was right✊😎
11165	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	This is exactly what I have right now. It’s very shooting when your wearing glasses and driving!!
11166	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Me when it happened : The sharingan...I knew I had it all along *Looks at my family*
11167	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Me peacefully looking at the Sky: Floaters: lmao no
11168	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I have these from a long time ago, but suddently, they have grown so much and i cant even focus on my daily tasks when theres a lot of light. I hope my brain gets used to it, because its really annoying and at the same time im a bit worried to how far can these things grow up
11169	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	i used to think that these are the souls of all the insects I had killed
11170	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Am I the only one who's never experienced this? 😅
11171	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Is it safe?
11172	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Before, I thought I was having an eye illness and I'm soon going to end up being sightless; now, I'm enlightened and relieved.
11173	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I was afraid i was going blind 😓
11174	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	My eye doctor told me what they were but it’s still so strange! Lately I’ve been seeing more. It’s annoying.
11175	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"I used to have large floaters all the time, almost every day, when I was living in the USA. I went to the optician and they had no idea what I was explaining. There were usually multiple floaters at one time and some were so large as to temporarily distract my vision. However, since leaving the USA eighteen years ago, I have only had one or two momentary ""encounters"" with floaters. I'm not sure if there was environmental cause in the USA or if it was in my late twenties when I reached some developmental point that brought an end to the daily floaters, but either way, I am thankful to know that I was not crazy and that it was likely nothing serious."
11176	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I went to two different Optometrists because I thought the floaters was a serious issue. They both told me basically the same thing...it is just something that some people have nothing to worry about. I've been vegetarian for years but decided to try to give up dairy. Magically my floaters went away. I don't know if that is why but along with other health issue clearing up - the floaters have not returned after about 18 months now. I watched this video to see if they mentioned dairy and was sorry that no mention of dairy products may be the cause. It didn't mention protein but didn't say specifically animal protein. Anyway, something to keep in mind.
11177	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought these were maps to some unfound treasure being transmitted to my eye😂
11178	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I have floaters since my early childhood. I asked many times my parents and other adults what those transparent things moving in the sky were, and they always replied that it was my imagination. So I kept this to myself for years until I read about this in a magazine, as a teen. I felt so vindicated at the time.
11179	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I experience eye floaters multiple times a day and now I’m terrified I’m gonna lose my vision or something omfg
11180	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I always thought that I was able to see some super microscopic things....also,I used to see colour clouds on walls which would change colour as per I think
11181	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I used to tell people that I can see the heat but now I know what’s happening thank you 😅
11182	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I see some floating light particles in different colors tho when I look at the sky
11183	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"Once I told my mom I had something in my eyes that I can only see when I look at the the sky and she said ""thats because youre always on your damn phone u got worms in your eyes 🙂"
11184	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	“Oh squiggly line in my eye fluid. I see you lurking there on the periphery of my vision. But when I try to look at you, you scurry away. Are you shy, squiggly line? Why only when I ignore you, do you return to the center of my eye? Oh, squiggly line, it’s alright, you are forgiven.” - Stewie Griffin, 2007.
11185	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"wait, am i the one who at least experienced it like once/month ? and always follow by dizziness and nausea ? i even told my doctor about this and she said ""it's NorRmAlL"""
11186	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Guys how can I stop obsessing over these and accept it ?? I actually became depressed over seeing this , still am

11188	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	As a kid i always imagine that these spot were distance birds faling out of the sky... i wanted to save them
11189	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought my eyes are so good that they could see these small things in the air.
11190	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I haven't seen that in years
11191	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When you said worm in the start i was almost dead💀

11206	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I used to think that they were molecules in air like oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen etc....😂😂😂
11207	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I literally thought I was a super human who was able to see micro-organisms

11234	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I can only see them if I close one eye then squint at a bright light, then I can see them on the light, sometimes I just sit in my room and look at them, it’s kind of satisfying
11235	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	My eye floaters went away after I dramatically improved my diet, shifting to a high nutrient dense, plant-based diet.
11236	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I'm going to get a migraine, the floaters increase. It's the exact time to take a pill before the chaos

11243	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I expect you to say that tiredness or hunger would be related to that
11244	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought I was able to see micro organisms 🤣

When i was in high school i was sitting in my tution class and my science class was going on when this phenomenon happened. I was curious and my teacher noticed and asked what are u doing? I SAID I AM ABLE TO SEE MICRO ORGANISMS IN AIR. I can never forget her look.
11251	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	U know I also have these creepy floaters and mixed them with blind spots.... When I told that to physician he just laughed and made fun of me.... But upto this point I was really concerned fr that.... But this video helped me to get rid of fear of becoming blind soon...... Thank u so much ted❤️💕📌

11255	177	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I always wondered what they were🙄, finally....I still remember asking my parents about it a million times
11256	178	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Everyone thought they were unique while I was thinking I was going blind-
11257	179	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought those are defects in eye Len's as it has lot of layers.
11258	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I only see these things when I look at lights or the sun. Say I looked at a triangle shaped window with sun coming through it, I would see a triangle shaped floaty. Usually green, blue, or hot pink for me.
11259	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	*Literally this was my BIGGEST question ever*
11260	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I finally got an answer , now today I would sleep without thinking about them anymore. Thank you so much !! ❤️

11263	185	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Well,whenever I saw the floaters or WBCs moving in the capillaries of my eye......I thought that this probably some phenomena of human eye and not any kind of microbes or bacteria....
11264	186	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought I can see electron and proton .. ....🤦
11265	187	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Ooohhh myyy goodness!!! And i thought i was the only one😱😱😱😱😱😱never thought i'll get a YouTube recommendation on this...

11299	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Good. I thought that there was something wrong with my eyesight to be honest.
11300	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	The fact that they’re inside of the eyes make them scarier.
11301	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"Lamest thing, I asked my teacher about she said they are""white blood cells"" but I've trust issues so I'm here."

11304	226	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought I had some kind of disease related to eyes or brain When I was a child😬

11306	228	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	For my entire childhood I thought something was wrong with my eyes. It appears and then disappears. Now it resolves it. Thanks a lot for the video. It was amazing to know the unknown.
11307	229	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I love this channel I always learn something new.
11308	230	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Now imagine seeing these 24/7, non stop. That's how it feels to have cataracts...
11309	231	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Lol I see both at the same time... since ever. I always thought that would be... the atoms of the air or some sort of bacteria or something like that... hm... Know I am smarter than before.
11310	232	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was 6 I always thought I was a superhero and could see bacteria and viruses without a microscope... there goes most of my childhood beliefs
11311	233	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was a kid i used to think it was some alien language trying to communicate with me or smth
11312	234	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Thanks, now I know what they are. But, why I am always seeing them every times?
11313	235	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I remember being told that floaters were weakened cells, hence why I could see them. And I never knew what those moving light dots were until now. I always thought these phenomena were just really weird. Very interesting.
11314	236	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I actually see colours in dark like red blue green etc floating around anyone else ?
11315	237	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I use to see little blinking lights between my peripheral vision...what was that??
11316	238	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Why, but I can't see it anymore (am I m too old or my eye sight is going dull)
11317	239	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Okay, i can finally say my eyes are okay! I cried and prayed so hard when I experienced it for the first time. Plus your Mom who keep on saying that I ruined my eyes by abusing it; like watching TV first before taking a bath and I'm gonna go blind if I keep doing it. Haha! Can wait to share/send this to my Mom!!!
11318	240	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	THIS MAKES ME FEEL SO MUCH BETTER! I THOUGHT I HAD A PARASITE IN MY EYES OR SOMETHING!
11319	241	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Do these go away cause I'm getting serious anxiety
11320	242	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	нихуя не понял и зачем мне это в рекоменды, оно даже не на русском
11321	243	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Did anyone else as a kid, look at an object (such as a cup) and see two of them when you gazed at it weird? I seriously thought I had X-Ray vision.
11322	244	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was a kid I Houghton that I was the only one who could see these and thought that they were atoms or molecules
11323	245	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	And when i try to focous on them they move and i tried to make them stop😂😂
11324	246	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was a child I used to think that it is molecules And only I can see them :D
11325	247	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Strangely enough, I've never seen these things in my entire life
11326	248	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	After 19 years of existence I finally know.
11327	249	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I was troubled with this from my childhood until now...
11328	250	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Bruh I legitimately thought I was actually seeing air-
11329	251	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I'mma do what most commentators do *Fun fact: you didn't search for this*
11330	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I see these, but I also have other strange phenomena. I have this sort of film of flashing dots over everything i look at. They're very subtle, more visible in the dark. The dots are transparent, so you see this sort of vibration over everything you look at, but in light it looks more like a bunch of flashing goo or something, but at night it looks like individual dots. I also have this thing where I'm looking at something, and then I look away and continue to see the thing for like a millisecond. I also see other kinds of flashing dots and strange colors when I close my eyes. My vision has been so weird ever since I've been a kid. I have plenty of floaters too, but those are the least annoying.
11331	253	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I thought this was something different based on the thumbnail. I have seen floaters in my eye before, but there is something else I have seen also. It kind of looks like a bunch of clear cells running around rapidly, bouncing off of each other. This would happen to me when I was younger and more active - usually after several pick-up games of basketball while I was very hot and thirsty. I thought this video was going to explain that... Dang, I was excited for a second lol. Good video though.
11332	254	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I had this question, and after 12 years I got the answer
11333	255	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	*Looks like my childhood of thinking those were Oxygen particles are ruined...*

11336	258	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I experienced that when I was in grade 6 every time I look outside the window of our classroom. And sometimes red and blue when on the dark.

11343	265	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I've never had a floater that's so very strange to me.
11344	266	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Strangely I started seeing floaters and the blue field entoptic phenomenon after taking amphetamines and I haven't been able to unsee them ever since . They are extremely distracting which makes going outside a anxious experience as my vision is filled with them . For the longest time I thought I had a parasites living in my eyes as several of them are bug like in appearance. Glad to know I'm not alone . Stay safe everyone and I hope you achieve some significant today, tomorrow and every day after that .
11345	267	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Literalmente pensé que era el único que podía ver esos efectos, ahora puedo descansar en paz XD
11346	268	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	What about the green moving patterns I often see in the darkness as I'm fallling asleep? Anyone else get those? They seem to swirl in a sort of repeating loop. Also, very occasionaly I get this brilliant white patch in front of my eyes for a few minutes, as if a splash of ultra-white paint has dropped onto the back of my eye, it starts off small and spreads out into a huge round blob with a clearly defined outline, then gradually blurs and fades away. What on earth is it?
11347	269	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I haven't even started to watch the video but I'm already laughing because of the comments because everyone thought they're unique for seeing such things, so do I. I really thought it was my superpower when I was a kid, turns out that I'm not alone.

11377	299	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	good thing this random video came on my suggestions. For YEARS I thought it was a piece of hair that got stuck in my eye and i kept tryin to rinse it off or rub it off and it never worked. Then I thought it was a cut in my eye I got from a sharp object that hit my eye at one point or something like that lol
11378	300	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I have lot of floaters in my right eye due to retinal detachment and I am not happy with it. 😒

11385	307	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	So what's the cure....????
11386	308	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Why didn't youtube recommend this 5 years earlier? I needed this video lol

11388	310	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	How to cure it? Please reply...
11389	311	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	She mentions that they could be an indication of another health problem, but then does not give any clue to what that problem may be. It would help me to know because sometimes I have had a lot of these.
11390	312	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	how to get rid of it
11391	313	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	No one searched for this But as soon you see the thumbnail you clicked
11392	314	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Floaters are a gift and a curse in my life Gift: They act as a warning sign that a Migraine is coming... Curse: A Migraine is coming... UPDATE: Due to the amount of likes and responses...I'm guessing that my experience is more common than I thought. Thought I might share some advice: If you also experience this, STAY AWAY FROM CAFFEINE...or at least excessive intake of caffeine. I used to always experience this onset when drinking energy drinks or multiple cups of coffee. Also, if you do start to experience this...Take extra strength Tylenol (If your body is okay with Acetaminophen). Take it as soon as you see the Floaters/Aurus. Worked every time for me. PS. I am NOT a physician...I am speaking directly from personal experience.
11393	315	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I disagree. It’s you formulating your life path. I see longest ones before I go for a drive, every time. Also they don’t disappear, they move with you eye just not necessarily in your target focus, usually off to the side slightly. If you see one and chase it and find it disappears, just scan back the same way and should be in the exact same place. They move as your non lead hand eye wanders, which it does, why many adults get a lazy eye.
11394	316	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	"Maybe im blind or something but literally I have never seen this ""little worms"""
11395	317	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	But what is a floater. . .
11396	318	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Ok, thats all good, so the big question is... how do we get rid of them?
11397	319	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	When I was younger, I thought I was the only one who saw them, sometimes when I was bored and saw them, I ended up trying to guess their shape or color and trying to focus them better, but they moved a lot and it was very difficult as soon as I saw them disappear , sometimes I thought it was a power like in the movies, and other times it was strange that only I saw them, but I was ashamed to ask other people if they also saw them, and if they thought I was crazy?. or that I imagined things or worse that I invented them ...
11398	320	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I’ve had them distract me severely while snowboarding.
11399	321	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Non of us searched for this but we all felt compelled to watch it
11400	322	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I remember when I was like 6 I thought there was a worm in my eye ;—;
11401	323	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	From my experience and a genetic blood test it makes sense that floaters are “reaction to food that does not belong in your body” in my case I did not know I had a sensitivity to proteins 🤷🏽‍♀️ My Dr. put me on a plant based diet and walla bye bye floaters 😲😳
11402	324	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Nobody: Literally nobody: Youtube: “What are those floaty things in your eye?” Me: Can the internet hack my brain now?
11403	325	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Ahhh! I hate that floaters because it happens to me very often and they are very annoying, it happens to me personally when I wake up or when I am really very tired or when I see something very bright as it says in the video. I hate them
11404	326	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Floaters can be largely removed. Chapel Hill Eye (NC), Dr John Wood, is a specialist in the procedure..worked for me!!

11409	331	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I’ve a collection of about 5. When I get stressed or upset I actually try to focus on my floaters and then I feel better because only I know they are there and that’s somehow comforting, I don’t know why lol
11410	332	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	why is nobody talking about how horrifying floaters are
11411	333	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Me: Looks up at ceiling *Sees demon face staring back at me* Idk what that is
11412	334	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Same here. I was 16 and got the answer at 30. Everyone laughed at me when I tell them I see paramoecium or amoeba-like thing ALL THE TIME!

11421	343	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I had to wait for more than 25 years for this. When I was a kid, I used to think that I had a superpower to see micro organisms.
11422	344	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I see them every single day and it’s really bothersome. I can’t look at the sky without seeing them and it used to not be like that. It makes me feel like I can’t enjoy being outside
11423	345	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	What has me wondering is, those tiny floaters of 4 or 5 seem to always be in the same spot since decades and when blue sprites appeared to me a few times they were still visible when closing the eyelids( lasted a few seconds after)
11424	346	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	sometimes when i look at a bright sky i see what looks like ...sort of a weird tunneling effect or distortion effect that does not really exist but looks like random waves moving out from a central point but doesnt fill the whole sight line...sort of like looking at a floater but its directly in the middle of my sight....ive had this on and off since ...well...always...what is that?
11425	347	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I told my bestfriend im 3rd grade that i could see something wierd sometimes and she said she could do. We were so happy cause we thought we were special 😐
11426	348	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Fun fact: you didn’t search for this.
11427	349	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I used to get Aurora Migraines where I would see a large collection in my peripheral vision and it makes me temporarily blind
11428	350	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I never had these until I had a migraine that lasted 4 days, ever since then I could see these, especially outside in the sun. Hella annoying
11429	351	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Its like when they say everyone is unique. Well, but if everyone is unique no one is unique.

11431	353	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	As a kid, when I tried to explain this problem I was facing, my family found it implausible. The opthalmologist my dad took me to did several tests and declared nothing was wrong with my eyes. He didn't believe me either. Watching this video is an aha moment for me.
11432	354	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	How to get rid of them? I need a real answer for this because im getting tired of them
11433	355	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Of course everyone was waiting to hear it’s corona 😭😭😭
11434	356	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I remember trying to catch them when I was a kid...
11435	357	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	@3:26 what kind of medical condition is it. What's the point of even making this video if you can't hint the public on what to look at . U shud name them for people to investigate it further because doctors toss patients out too quickly and DON'T LISTEN EVEN UNTIL YOU GIVE THEM ALL THE ANSWERS YRSELF
11436	358	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	So we actually see micro scopic things with in our eyes
11437	359	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Finally... I wondered what this was since I'm like 15 Years old. I'm 27 now.
11438	360	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Soo yeah, 3 minutes explained something 3 doctors couldn't explain to me in like 10 years.. well then i'm not insane after all.

11443	365	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	My eye doctor told me there was nothing in my right eye. Can still see them. Have taken serious trauma to that side of my head, eye, and orbital socket.

11445	367	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Simple! They are just reflections of light floating around in your eyes because you may have stared at a light (Say the one on your ceiling) for an extended amount of time.
11446	368	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Your eyes go to the toilet as well and dont flush properly, leaving floaters.

11463	385	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE SEEING THESE THINGS THAT OCCUR INSIDE THE EYE
11464	386	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Does anyone else see freaky spiraling colors when they press on their eyes ?
11465	387	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Sometime when i wake up from bed you know we a bit blurred but these phenomenon just comming were i sees
11466	388	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I've had these phenomenons happen to me very often in my life. When I was a kid, I just thought they were things that predicted something bad was going to happen to me later that day. I later dropped this idea because my Mother told me it was just an eyelash in my eye. (It wasn't) I was much older now, and I tried to go for a walk outside and get some groceries for my Mom. During this time I had been highly suicidal, and I was walking beside a lot of quickly moving cars. This phenomenon happened, and I tried to pass it off again. But this time it felt like the things in my eye were touching me- pushing me. I felt a strong desire to throw myself into traffic. This phenomenon is very interesting and I'm glad I know what it is now.
11467	389	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	I was really depressed when i first saw these things as a kid, everyday i would move my eyes around just to check that if they had disappeared or not but i've learned to live with it now.
11468	390	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6e_m9iq-4Q	Damn, this should be available 12 years ago. The time after i shared this to my mom, she called me crazy.

11496	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	it feels so unreal that this actually happens for every female like me. why cant we just not have it like the other animals :/
11497	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	For each male, who are NOT afraid to watch this, we should give y’all major props, 👍🏻

11502	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Sorry girls.
11503	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Dog don't menstruate? My dog did blood regularly, that's how I learnt what periods was

11505	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	as a guy, no one explained me what is period, after knowing how the hormone changes and cramps are annoys them but they still smiles the bright.. my respect again went high #respect
11506	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	How does it feels to have a period? I have went through the intestinal worm though, does it feel like that?
11507	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	But why once a month? Once a year or once every 6 month would make much more sense.
11508	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	But like- why?
11509	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	As a teenage male this makes me respect girls even more. Dealing with horrendous cramps, releasing blood, and hormone changes every month while just going about your day takes strength and deserves respect. Stay strong gals y’all got this! 💪❤️
11510	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Because men couldn't handle it.
11511	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I think this is the way meant for animals..not humans (humans have brain), I believe one day humans will find a way get rid of this period and way of child birth, through evolution and technology. I don't know.

I don't remember periods being a significant thing in my life in the last 10 years but I've always gotten cramps, pimples, mood swings, bloating, constipation, fatigue and other symptoms every month for 10 years! Its like women are used to being sick and still going on with their normal lives.. so much respect.

11567	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	But why every month why can’t every 10 years? 😃
11568	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Is it weird that I only get my period every 2-3 months? Also, my periods are light and only last about 3 days. I used to have periods every month in middle school, but I went about 6-7 months without a period when I was in 8th grade. Since then, I’ve had the long duration between periods. I don’t get noticeable cramps and I don’t have mood changes during my period. I am 22 years old now and I don’t know if I should see a gynecologist or if this is normal.
11569	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	there was a time when my period came before the scheduled day, and then I got my period in the classroom and the blood stained my whole pants I was very embarrassed and everyone saw it. It was terrible... I'm from Brazil and I loved the video. :3

11572	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	There's another benefit from the period: the pain we feel because the egg rubs against the uterine wall, preparing our bodies to feel the pain that comes with pregnancy. the human body is really complex and amazing!!

11616	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	*not having a proper period in over two years* *sweats profoundly* ⚠If you don't want to read this, don't go beyond this point, I'm not forcing you⚠ So I have a bit of an explanation on my end, but don't have a solution for this situation aside from seeing a gynecologist So as I've mentioned, my menstrual cycle hasn't come properly in over two years (basically the summer before covid hit was when it stopped) the large gaps of the cycle ended up being hereditary from my mom since she used to not have it for 6 months in her mid-teens, and that started when I was 15. It would be 6 months twice, then a year, and now two years for the gaps. And before 15, my menstrual was normal, it would come about once a month, but at the most 7 days later from a month. I freaked out when I didn't get it a month and a half later when I was 15, but my mom thought it was just late, even though I was hoping it wasn't pregnancy (it wasn't). 2 months went by, and I still freaked out, but not as bad, I actually felt great not dealing with it. 6 months rolled around and it definitely threw me off seeing it again, but it was a normal 7 days at most. It never came back until another 6 months, etc. SO! Now not having it for over two years, no signs of pregnancy, it feels nice, but it shouldn't be this way. Here's actually the issue I'm dealing with right now... ⚠This is where I'd suggest stopping unless you have some advice for this situation⚠ Usually, pee is normal, but during the menstrual, it's red (obviously) and the menstrual stains your clothes the majority of the time if you aren't covered properly. I actually still stain some of my clothes, but it's usually when I really need to use the restroom, and that pressure to try holding it in shows that I do stain my clothes a bit, but when I pee, my pee is normal. I've showered and actually would clean around there and inside, and there's actually blood inside when I clean it, but it never comes out, like it's trapped there unless it's scraped or something. And here's the other thing (as embarrassing as this is, it's involved) when I use the... restroom that's not pee... when I wipe, it's bloody too, more bloody than when I wipe going pee (which there's rare cases when it's bloody wiping after pee) In the end, I'm still planning on seeing a gynecologist, but, if you guys have simple advice that's not too technical, I'm all ears since this is good not dealing with the monthly suffering, but I know it's actually bad for my body to not do that cleansing.

11659	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	For the women who suffer from cramps I do too. Recently I found kratom works wonderfully. I steep it like teas then mix it with chamomile tea. Which is also a sedative that helps with cramps. I was overdosing on OTC before discovering kratom.
11660	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I stared shaking while watching this...

11674	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	EASY Why do women have periods? because adam and eve sinned and it was Eve's punishment to bare children and the pain of childbith and periods, and a mans was hard labor to work the rest of the days of his life.

11681	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"It's funny to me when sometimes I'm in a terrible mood. Everything and everyone annoys me. I'm very irritable and then a day or 2 later the ""curse"" arrives and then I'm like, ooohhhhhhhhhhh lol"
11682	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Because Eve ate the apple so now they got punished
11683	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	So. In my opinion, I feel like this is kinda unnecessary. Why? You learn this in health class. But ok! To the boys educating themselves! ( This is not meant to be offensive, It's just my opinion)

11709	231	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Menstrual cycles were a punishment caused by Adam and Eve because they ate from a certain tree that they were specifically told not to eat from.

11728	250	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I want to have my uterus removed because periods limit my life too much. I will adopt a child if I want one.
11729	251	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	A few hours after your period begins, your estrogen climbs, which boosts your brain's level of the feel-good chemical serotonin. The result: PMS weepiness and irritability may be replaced with an upbeat, social, and chatty feeling. This definitely explains why I feel like I’m on some sort of serotonin drip. Like honestly, plenty of my periods have had me soaring sky high on it. Anyone else here relate? Because literally no one else in my family can and I’m curious to know.
11730	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I'm a teenager girl, I know all about my body, but still watching it, and I always wonder that why can't I have period cramps, but I'm happy for that. Because I know how much my friends suffer. I'm from India. It is celebrated as a big function. I love this function, because when I'm having that function, everyone gave me sweets, and soooo many healthy foods for exactly one month and we need to eat raw country egg and oil daily. But fortunately, I only drank raw eggs. On our first time having period we need to eat a lot of healthy foods, that gave me no cramps at all. It's for all girls to eat properly on that time, that's your wish to eat healthy or not, but if you don't want cramps, eat lots of healthy foods at least a month when your first period starts. I hope it will help some of you💜💜💜

Being from a non native English Country, we literally are taught EVERYTHING about periods in 10th grade...and it's well something people can not easily forget!! (Ps:- and i m a teenage boy)

11776	298	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	What happens to women who don't get regular periods, then? I have an irregular period and for the past three years, I only menstruated once a year. Then the fourth, twice, two months continuously. I thought it was gonna be regular at that point but I didn't have a period at all this 2020. I had a check-up and got some meds but I got a period three months after, and then it stopped altogether again. I don't know if I'm sick or what.

11814	336	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	This video narration is extremely hostile to the baby in the womb. The language makes it sound like the baby 'crawled' into his/her mother's womb forcefully and 'made' the mother's body take care of him/her. I clicked on the video to see if I could learn more about my periods, not to hear how TED-Ed intensely dislikes the babies in the mothers' wombs.

It does not matter if there is a man or not... Right? EDIT: Please give a source, but Im just gonna chop this up to bad wording... And also I cant post comments on this channel anymore...

11876	398	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I remember a story that my teacher told me. There was a girl, raised by a single father due to her mother dying from a disease when the girl was young. One day, when she was around 10, she got her first period and was crying, fearing that she’d die and thinking that she was going to end up like her mother. This really put me into perspective about this. How scary must it be to get your first period especially when you weren’t educated about it.
11877	399	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	One night I was just watching anime at 3. My uterus was like, yup you are now ready and I got my period the next morning. -_-

11899	421	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Period is such a waste of energy, nutrients, and hormone roller coaster honestly. Why can't the body just absorb it back and use it instead removing it out?
11900	422	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Can we change “women” to “people” or “people with uteruses” or just “why do we have periods” I just think it’s important to acknowledge all the people who aren’t women who also have periods.
11901	423	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Trans men also have periods,just saying
11902	424	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	our body is an amazing instrument. We have to respect it, look after it and let it do its functions properly. Proud to be a mother

11922	444	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Yes this is why girls are stronger than boys because boys can't stand periods pain. But girls bear the pain and work the same time like my mother. I am a 12 years old girl and I started my periods yesterday this is my 2nd day and it was paining a few seconds ago too much pain can't bear it. If girls are stronger than boys is true then like over here👇👇👇👇

11943	465	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Woah woah woah, have we forgotten that female dogs also have periods?
11944	466	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"This is the ONLY explanation I have ever seen that actually tried to provide any reason behind the purpose of shedding the lining every month. Every other program is basically ""I don't know, we just evolved that way"". In this video, they describe it as a self-defense mechanism to protect against ""bad embryos"". The problem with that is, some bad embryos still attach and continue to survive for a lot longer before ending up as a missed miscarriage or whatnot or get all the way to birth and then die shortly afterward, so it isn't a foolproof method of weeding out bad genetics. I think the ""bad embryo"" theory came about because it's actually the lack of hormone signals that causes shedding. I'm guessing they thought this up assuming that's how they think the body detects a ""bad embryo"" by it failing to send proper hormone signals being on par with a non-fertilized egg that sends none; that ""good embryos"" hit a hormone threshold required to keep developing. If this were the case, they could have made a mention towards connecting it to solving the reason behind spontaneous miscarriage, but they didn't. I've also never heard of the endometrium lining making it more difficult to allow implantation nor that it causes a feedback loop of more aggressive implantation in successive generations. I had thought this video was initially going to say that menstruation was just hormonal ""practice"" for when the body needs to expel the placenta, but it unfortunately never connected that similarity. Whether or not a human gets pregnant, the lining is always built up then shed, some every month, others after 9 months (implantation just puts a temporary stay order). It's all just tied to hormone feedback loop based around the egg's lifespan. The lining that cycle is meant for that egg(offspring). When the egg (offspring) goes, so does the lining as it isn't needed anymore as its 'fulfilled' its purpose already even if it actually was never used. The body then repeats the process to create another offspring."

12065	587	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Is it peeing alot
12066	588	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Hey I feel sorry ya'll, I'm a guy who studies to be a doctor and I knows things, well the fact is we boys have issues too. We can't detect half the color you can. Also girls can sence twice the more smell than boys. But we have an advantage though, we can see 2x more brighter in dark. I mean we have twice the rod cells and I basically can see everything if there's a tiny source of light, like from the moon. Also we are healthier. But you sometimes we also wish that we were like you, there's a lots of pressure on us and we live a lot shorter than you will. The society Dislikes us, you have many rights and all and we barely have any. Also after puberty the throat will became big and it's like having a cough throughout our entire life, also our thing can get inflated at random times so it's always risky to be out there or we'll be exposed. We can even lactate, the society won't here us or our pain, he have to hide somewhere and cry there making sure nobody notices us. the conclusion is everyone is equal and every person have goods and bads. Still wanna thank ya'll for suffering all these

12203	725	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Us girls need to STOP complaining about our period. Take pain killers, if its so bad that we have to complain about cramps or if you can't just take regular meds, then ask your doctor if you can use other one's, and if thats not good enough think about the ppl that have cysts, or who just dont get to have their first period and other girls bully them for not having one.
12204	726	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I remember when my crush was having her period during class... I was sitting next to her asking “are u ok?” And she ignored me a glanced at her bf, who then proceeded to ask permission from the teacher to go to the infirmary... I was so confused since I had no idea what was going on, I asked the teacher and she just told me: “your health teacher will explain that to you on the next semester”... until then I was convinced that women were aliens since they can communicate stuff like that with a glance 😅 little did I know the madness that goes inside of them each month
12205	727	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	How tf did YouTube know I'm on my period and added this video to my recommended list?
12206	728	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	0:15 Don’t dogs get periods too?
12207	729	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	So basically either way we’re miserable.
12208	730	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Period blood smells absolutely revolting. I remember back a long time ago a baby sitter took care of me. She must've gone to use the restroom. I went to go pee after she did and I remember entering the restroom and nearly vomiting from the stench. Now come to think of it I guess she was on her period. I will never forget that scent of fish, rotten eggs, and the taco bell restroom though.

12277	799	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Why am I watching this as a male
12278	800	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	遺伝子の利己性理論は母と胎児との間にも成り立つよ、という話なのかな。しかし、人間と一部の動物がリスキーな生殖システムを採用した適応論的な利点がよく分からない。母体は胚のスクリーニングテストをする➡︎強い胚だけが選抜される➡︎逆に母体は侵襲をくらいやすくなる➡︎土台となる子宮内膜ごとさようなら！…っていう理解で合ってるかしら…？ 未受精卵のくせに子宮内膜に着床しようとするのはなぜ？（自分の理解が間違ってるような…） ひとたび着床したら胎盤形成が始まってしまいハイリスクなのは分かるが、それを避けるのに子宮内膜をベリベリッと引っぺがすのはコスト高すぎでは…？ 不要な着床を避けたり、排出や再吸収をする機構に進化しなかったのには理由があるのだろうか。ここで説明されている選抜理論も仮説なのだろうけれど、いまいち釈然としないので、他でも勉強したいと思います。 もう一点、「父親からの遺伝子は母親から相応以上の栄養分を吸い取り自身が生き残ろうとします」との説明がよく理解できません。「相応な栄養分(fair share)」とは具体的にどのような量を言うのでしょうか？ また、父からの遺伝子が母体の遺伝子と対立するという構図は、他の動物についても同様のはずですから、人間などに限られる月経システムの説明には不適当ではないでしょうか？ それに、父親からの遺伝子は母体との共倒れも避けるはずですよね。
12279	801	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Honestly I don’t mind my period, it’s just the fact I can’t eat what I want that bothers me.
12280	802	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	0:20 What about dogs ? They do also have a menstruation 2 times a year for around 14 days.

12358	880	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Couple questions: How do women get cramps? Can tampons hurt the uterus or harm the ability to get pregnant? Why is the smell of period blood so much stronger and different from regular blood from the rest of the body like from a nosebleed? What is the brown runoff at the end of a period? What causes it? How can birth control pills and other medicines actually STOP periods? I have a lot more but I’ll keep the rest to myself....

12395	917	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I hate my periods so much that i actually can't wait to turn 18 so i can have my ovaries (maybe even the whole uterus) removed, i really just can't i tried everything from tampons to pads to diva cups and absolutely nothing feels comfortable not to mention that i have the worst cramps ever they are so bad that sometimes i have to skip school because of them, i can't go out and everything is usually ruined when i get my period. So i just can't wait to have them removed i don't want to have children when i become older so i really don't see the point of just dealing with this instead of solving it
12396	918	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I thought dogs menstruated too

12411	933	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Please make a video about why women have PMS or are moody when their period is about to arrive. It will help a ton of confused boyfriends and husbands and will make relationships better.

12420	942	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	What I've learned: Babies are like vampire parasites that suck their mothers dry and drain their life energy. Also why am I here?
12421	943	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	why do we have to go through this pain 😭😭😭

12423	945	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I honestly think that we get our period way too early in life. Who the heck is gonna have a baby at 12?
12424	946	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I just want to let all the girls know that you guys are awesome and badasses, you guys can survive bleeding for days. lol Sincerely, a guy :)

12428	950	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I'm scared I'm 12 and I just got my period 😔😖
12429	951	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Im... just 10 years old I had period early and I'm not even pregnant.
12430	952	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	nu-uh my dog has periods 2.
12431	953	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	But why don't other mammals menstruate then?
12432	954	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	First, I was unaware that bats menstruated. Never would have thought that, if we are being honest. I know that they are considered mammals, but I wonder why they go through this process. Furthermore, it is interesting to know that in some countries a period is misunderstood. Which is actually really sad since this prevents girls from being able to go school or work. This misunderstanding is depriving young girls of a full education that they have a right to. I wish that these countries would be educated on this issue and some type of solution be put in place. I could not imagine not being able to go to school once every month because of something I could not control (or not having the proper products). Even in 1st world countries, I feel like periods are still slightly taboo. No one really talks about them; it is just something that is. I wish that society would get over this stigma so it can be a more acceptable and comfortable thing to talk about. Not even just periods, now that I think about it; women's health in general shouldn't be so taboo. I am not sure why people don't talk about women's health as much as they do men's but removing the stigma would be very beneficial to women as whole. Being open about your health allows others to learn and not be so afraid to talk to someone if they think something is wrong. Hopefully, one day the health of women can be discussed just as causally as those of men.
12433	955	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I came here for the comments.
12434	956	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	This makes me afraid to get pregnant now what the heck & now not only the delivery part
12435	957	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I'm almost 15 but I haven't had my period yet.. it that bad? I'm worried cause all my friends (same age) have already had their period and there might be something wrong with me.
12436	958	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"I always forget how dangerous pregnancy can be because I don't think I've ever known a woman that had a ""difficult"" pregnancy. I work with a woman that's had nine kids and all her pregnancies were relatively easy."
12437	959	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Never having children. Ever.
12438	960	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	If that's the case why do young girls (I'm 15 and I'm on mine) get them too
12439	961	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	*reasons why dans a fail tune to this ok* REASONS WHY IM ADOOOOPTING!! YAY

12441	963	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	3/4 of the video is of pregnancy NOT periods.
12442	964	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I'm just trying to watch a fucking video and I see a bunch of whiny piss babies in the comment section...
12443	965	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	sometimes I hate being a girl
12444	966	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Wait so other animals have the power to self-abort? Lucky bastards.

12446	968	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	dogs menstruate too..
12447	969	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Sometimes my period skips a month. But then the next stays on for an extra few days so fml!
12448	970	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I'm a guy and I know periods suck. I feel bad for the gals.
12449	971	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	additional info.. even dogs do menstruate. once every 4 months and lasts for 3 weeks.
12450	972	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Aaaaaaaaaaaaand now I'm convinced more than ever that babies are literally parasites~!
12451	973	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	long story short. eve gave adam the fruit, all woman suffer.
12452	974	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I only looked this up because I'm on mine and I'm fed up with it!
12453	975	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	It's kinda funny how angry everybody is getting about this video. If you don't want to have children, that's fine and I am sorry, yet it is still amazing how a woman's body is designed to do all of this. Without this cycle, none of us would be watching this video right now.
12454	976	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Example: Imagine there is a woman living with you named Aunt Flo she wants a baby and dolls up the house with pillows and cribs and such but then when there's no baby she goes insane and crams the pillows and cribs through the door way...EXCEPT THE PILLOWS AND CRIBS ARE MADE OUT OF BLOOD!
12455	977	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	we r basically keeping the human race alive n going through all these ordeals to keep it that way n wat do the men give us in return disrespect misogyny discrimination dominance n I dnt even wanna tok abt d other things that it goes to in mny parts of d world. this is heights of shamelessness
12456	978	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Why did I click this. I already know

12458	980	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I still don't really understand this, I only have brothers as siblings :(
12459	981	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	When I literally clicked this video my period came! Lol
12460	982	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	periods sucks cramps hurt like if someone is trying to kill you from the inside !! but i don't want to have a baby cause i am afraid i have very painful periods so i'm like my pregnancy is gonna be way worse i'm just a kid btw 😂😂
12461	983	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	UGGHHHH I hate kids anyway! I want to remove the stupid thing but there are wayy more bad things than good things :/ I don't want to die each month but I also don't want a higher chance of a heart attack and literally die after :/ hulp
12462	984	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I hope the only guys watching this are fathers
12463	985	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I have a serious question. Me and my girlfriend been together already 4 months and I was wondering when she have periods does it mean that she is not a virgen????
12464	986	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	In short, men should stick around and give their woman 100% full support when they go through such ordeal.
12465	987	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Who is on their period right now?
12466	988	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	this isn't... this doesnt make any sense?
12467	989	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"1:42 ""In most mammals, the placenta is confined behind a barrier of maternal cells... But in humans and a few other species, the placenta actually penetrates right into the mother's circulatory system to directly access her blood stream."" So, hold on a moment... wouldn't this whole menstruation thing be completely unnecessary if the placenta were just... not allowed to get into the *entire fucking blood stream*? Why the hell is it even *allowed* there, if it's so dangerous?"
12468	990	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	-claps- women are awesome respect them or else
12469	991	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Us girls are troopers to go through all this stuff, I mean come on PEEING BLOOD?!

12472	994	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Am I the only one that was irritated by the fact that this video only discusses menstruation through the lens of pregnancy? Like women don't only have periods when there's the possibility of the a pregnancy...
12473	995	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I thought that dogs had periods too?
12474	996	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	dogs too

12480	1002	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"But in order for women to menstruate they need to have sex beforehand? Or? I don't really get it. Whatever bacteria comes down there the system ""slushes"" everything down by getting the female to menstruate? Is that right?"
12481	1003	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	And you still expect us to want children? Not me,thanks. (This comment is not meant to influence anyone about their own decisions) I...no
12482	1004	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Thanks to all women out there, my mother, sister and wife. You went through a lot for us. May God bless you.
12483	1005	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"So... if i don't want to have baby's NEVER... this shit is useless, like the chest, or the ""female curves"". Thank you for nothing mother nature."
12484	1006	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	This is a stupid question but; Do women still need periods if they dont want to ever have kids?
12485	1007	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	so the uterus ends the pregnancy if the baby is not strong.... hmmmmmmmmmm. anyone wants to call uterus as a killer? when people choose abortion it is killing, but when uterus does it it is just period...
12486	1008	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I wish guys could have a period

12502	1024	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Humanity is very immature I see. -_-
12503	1025	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Does that mean I'm already having a baby in young age? '-'

12512	1034	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Women suffer a few days every month they didn't get laid. I suffer every day of the month I didn't get laid.

12515	1037	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Thank god I was born a dude!
12516	1038	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Seeing a literal Period Party in the comment section! Half the human race gets it, and it's part of the process that creates all of human life. DEAL WITH IT!
12517	1039	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I use to think it felt good for women to have periods. I thought to them it felt like they were constantly peeing or having an orgasm. I was wrong.
12518	1040	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	So periods are literally made of dead fetus eggs? -pukes-
12519	1041	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	i swear dogs mestruate?!
12520	1042	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	The more I hear about pregnancy, the less I want anything to do with it.
12521	1043	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	there's an idiot currently on twitter saying periods aren't natural and that she's a vegan who's period went from 5 to 2 days after she became one.
12522	1044	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Okay NOT SAYING I AM PREGNANT BUT ANYWAY, if you DI get pregnant, do you still get your period?
12523	1045	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	So women, remember, before you decide to menstruate, remember that children in africa are starving without nutrients...
12524	1046	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	But 😶, but my dog menstruated
12525	1047	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Babies are fucking greedy
12526	1048	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	If only a few animals have periods, then why does my dog bleed every month?
12527	1049	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	comment what age u got your period : i haven't got mine yet am 13
12528	1050	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	get pregnency ,get rid of periods.
12529	1051	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Nature is extremely fucked-up! I wish I was a male so I wouldn't have to go through this bleeding bullshit every month! Why every month?? Why not every 6 months at least!? No wonder I sometimes hate being human lol.
12530	1052	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	The most useless video. I don't care about this shit!
12531	1053	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	So would this mean that humans are closely related to bats? Seems odd that such different species would develop such an unusual reproduction trait independently of each other.
12532	1054	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	What if you don't want to have a baby.
12533	1055	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"For those wondering ""Yes, but why does it HURT"": Cramps are the muscles of your uterus contracting in order to push the endometrium out of your body. In short, you are actually having miniature contractions. The more you know~"
12534	1056	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Dogs have mensturation.
12535	1057	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	dogs menstruat
12536	1058	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	2:47 WTF is preeclampsia? This is for kids, so if you bring something ultra mega complicated up without saying what it is, then you are stupid.
12537	1059	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	dogs menstruate too.
12538	1060	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	The male DNA wants the baby to exploit the woman as much as possible, while the female DNA tries to prevent it. I guess menstruation occurs because human male DNA is extra aggressive?
12539	1061	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I totally love how the narrator puts the blame on the man not only for daring to give the baby his dna but for the entire pregnancy being dangerous! Hilarious! So what we have learned kiddies is that abortion happens in nature all the time so having law totally outlawing it are nonsensical!
12540	1062	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	But don't dogs have periods
12541	1063	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I'm pretty sure dogs do, I had a pit bull who most certainly had her period
12542	1064	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	why that women is SO SAD!!! & how much is the distance between vagina opening and womb??
12543	1065	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	To annoy men on a monthly basis.
12544	1066	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"My question now is, If woman's body inherently reject harmful embryo, (which eventually dies). At what point that it is considered Abortion? I mean common, what's the difference between ""deliberate abortion"" than ""biological abortion""? (For educational purpose of course, I didn't even have a gf)"
12545	1067	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	0:15 i thought the reason we spay our dogs is because they menstruate everywhere
12546	1068	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Screw that. I'm turning into a kangaroo
12547	1069	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I think the question is; why do women's reproductive system look like the skull of a bull?
12548	1070	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	BECAUSE PATRIARCHY
12549	1071	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Informative, but I'm not sure why this video seems intent on casting a fetus as some kind of foreign organism intent harming the mother as it's developing. I find it amazing how the developing baby and the mother's body interact and communicate during the pregnancy. It's not one taking over the other, it's two bodies working symbiotically to achieve a common aim: the healthy development of a human child. It seems uncharitable, overly-simplistic, and inaccurate to reduce such a complex relationship to a 'parasite-host' interaction. :/
12550	1072	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Periods are not THAT bad. Well, not for me at least. I get cramps, cravings, and mood swings, but you deal with it, you know? It's part of being a woman, so you just have to suck it up. I've had times where I've wanted to punch people,eat the entire supply at the grocery store, and cry from pain or bloating, but I just remember that I'd rather deal with the PMS than being pregnant right now.
12551	1073	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	... to make up for not having a brain ?
12552	1074	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I'm already calling bullshit after 30 seconds because I have 2 dogs that menstruate and have tons of friends who's dogs menstruate as well.
12553	1075	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"""Why do women have periods ?"" To have a good excuse for breaking our balls ! ! ! :)"
12554	1076	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	how come you didin't mention dogs?
12555	1077	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"And final thing; a lot of you guys can complain about how moody and ""crazy and miserable"" women get on their periods but Donald Trump, for example, is more emotionally unstable than any woman I've ever met....."
12556	1078	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I understand this is normal... But I will never look at a girl the same way again + I cringe (or even gag) when periods are mentioned (not normal... I'm just a pussy.)
12557	1079	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I thought dogs menstruated too?
12558	1080	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	So you telling me a female dog does not menstrate, then why the fuck am I buying a diper so she won't bleed all over my couch
12559	1081	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	What about dogs?
12560	1082	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	What about dogs? I thought they menstruated too.
12561	1083	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Why do humans have periods more often than other mammals?
12562	1084	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	PREGNANCY IS NOT ADVERSARIAL. Are their challenges in gestation? Sure, however it is all about perspective. If a man buys groceries for his family and has a teenage boy who is undergoing a surge in hormonal development and experiencing sudden noticeable spikes in physical growth, and this leads to him consuming the lion's share of groceries, does that make him an ADVERSARY?. I think a only a purely financial mindset would depict him as such. In terms of pure cost analysis he is a drain. In terms of a future investment, he is a lumbering question mark. However a family oriented mind would see it as a challenge in a growing family. This idea that nature is suppose to be perfectly harmonious is idealism. Nature does require a certain level of homeostasis but that process itself is rife with pain, exploitation, inconvenience, and improvising around or out of last minute obstacles. A pro-abortion mind sees the unborn child as a potential threat, and an adversary. Why? It makes it easier to kill if it is not innocent. If it is this foreign agent that is malevolently manipulating your blood flow then snuffing it out is self defense. Pregnancy is a beautiful symbiotic relationship. Does it have it's dangers? Yes but every worthwhile relationship does. Man loses his job, wife's standard of living goes down. This is not adversarial but sharing of a common burden. Relationships are yokes biding persons in good times and bad. You get another person's blessing and you get another person's problems.
12563	1085	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Does this mean that taking the pill year round is potentially harmful?
12564	1086	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Yep,..still after watching this I have no idea about the female body...
12565	1087	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Please, don't get technical! It's much simpler than that.
12566	1088	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Do canine not have menstrual cycles? Why was this not mentioned?
12567	1089	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	ughhh i hate periods.. it hurts so bad like sometimes I faint from the pain ( am not kidding) one time I faint like 3 times
12568	1090	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	You forgot dogs.
12569	1091	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Wow, this video made babies sound like some dangerous free loader parasites.
12570	1092	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Yeesh. Some raging TRP types in the comments. Even on a topic that relates to the biological imperative to continue our species. Because women... rage.
12571	1093	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Dogs also menstruated
12572	1094	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I'm confused why someone would dislike this? Lool
12573	1095	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	to make us our (guys) lives worse than miserable. that's why.
12574	1096	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Has the question of why do humans menstruate so often? Does it have to do with coinciding with moon phases or just pure coincidence?
12575	1097	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	It's a punishment from God.
12576	1098	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"I'm now pretty certain ""womb envy"" has never existed in any human male subconscious."
12577	1099	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Women have periods so they know what it's like for a man to live with irritating cunts
12578	1100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	And dogs or not ??
12579	1101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	see guys.. without girls.. ur nothing.
12580	1102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Hi, guy who has a uterus here. I usually wouldn't get pissy over this but I'm literally having my period RIGHT NOW. So I'm just gonna say it. Not all women have periods, not all periods are had by women. Okay? Okay. Sincerely, the guy who has to carry pads in his gym bag.
12581	1103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I drifted away in first minute, gave my best.
12582	1104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"So why do feminists get mad if you say ""you were made to have babies""? Legit, your body prepares for a baby every month..."
12583	1105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	The video didn't explain why only a few animals have periods. How does it work for all those animals that don't get periods?
12584	1106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I wish I could subtitle your videos, so some friends of mine would be able to understand it too :/
12585	1107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"so I was sitting here thinking what if a period failed and the fetus/egg survived would that be a parthenogenesis (""virgin birth"") and I was thinking how crazy it would be for Jesus to born this way. male and through parthenogenesis that would be a crazy series of events."
12586	1108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	So if you don't want to have kids menstruation is useless?
12587	1109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Too bad for those who don't feel like contributing to the continuation of the human race...
12588	1110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	So... periods are your body punishing you for not getting pregnant?
12589	1111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	In simple words: Uterus is planning for a baby. It puts up cute elephant wallpaper, buys a cradle, and goes shopping. But then, uterus realises that it's not having a baby. Uterus goes apeshit. Uterus tears down wallpaper, and throws everything away. Uterus goes through this every god damn month.
12590	1112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	More mysterious is the fact that I got my period today and this pops up on my youtube. WTF ?
12591	1113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I get the feeling some people aren't going to like how DNA is represented at 1:15
12592	1114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	What I learned from this vid is that fetuses are parasites
12593	1115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"I wish those countries with deep stigma against ""periods"" could watch this video. It's sad that there are places where menstruation is misunderstood thereby making menstrual pads inaccessible to young girls. They have to skip school or quit entirely for fear of hatred if leaks should happen in the school. (https://www.facebook.com/amightygirl/posts/890303754339272:0) Glad how menstruation was presented here in its truest sense: to ensure the continuity of the human race (even if out of it are people who hate women)"
12594	1116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	What the actual fuck. My dog has her period all over the house, don't tell me she's busy making jam. Of course they menstruate. jdkfjaslkdfjaklsdjfklasjdfkljaskldfjaklsdfjklasdjfklasjdflkajskldfaklsdfjlkasjdflkjkljfdkljklasf;jl;jadsflkjkasldjflk the cycle might mean different stuff but AAJKDLFJlkdfjlksdafllkjdfjlk
12595	1117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I didn't got can anybody explain this in simple words 😖
12596	1118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	So essentially a baby is hacking the mother mainframe for unlimited nutrients.
12597	1119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	This still doesn't explain why humans' reproductive system work this way. This seems to be a horribly dangerous, wasteful & messy method compared to some of the others in the animal kingdom. So much for evolution through natural selection.
12598	1120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Women complain when they get pregnant. When they don't they complain about their periods. When they don't they complain about not getting a period:)
12599	1121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I thought all mammals had periods (proof: dogs). Nice to learn something new! =D
12600	1122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I think this is the only time I have ever heard exactly WHY we have periods, other than to get rid of unfertilised eggs. Thanks TEDEd! :)
12601	1123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	so happy to be a dude...
12602	1124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"So much for ""intelligent design""."
12603	1125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	I can't trust anything that can bleed for a week and not die.
12604	1126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	ooooh, to weed out the bad ones... Now if only we women had a way to weed out the terrible men and find a suitable baby-daddy. lol hahahahahaha
12605	1127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Why am i watching this ?
12606	1128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	thanks for explaining this, but if the pregnancy is this much of a risk why the hell do women still go through it? it should STOP! who gives a damn if humans go extinct? as long as they live their lives to its maximum that's enough!
12607	1129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	"Still mad we have to menstruate. Maybe I'm just bitter but Kangaroos and other animals mentioned seem to be having healthy babies without much issue. Why? Is it our big brains that make this rigorous selection harder? I don't see how natural selection could have overcome ""error of evolution"" as I call it."
12608	1130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjbgZwgdY7Q	Simple: Uterus wants baby.we don't have baby. Uterus angry

12611	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	W What???? I always thought dandruff was normal..
12612	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	i’ve dealt with it for 18 years now and it’s only gotten worse, my family literally calls me snow flake 😭 it has become one of my biggest insecurities and yet i’m just now doing research on it. i think it’s partly bc i’ve been told i can never get rid of it but i still have hope
12613	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	so the dandruff will stick with us even if we use the shampoo and stop using it for a time .
12614	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	There is an ayurvedic oil, that removes dandruff completly and permanently.. my experiance👍..
12615	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have had dandruff for 4 years no matter what it never goes away I have tried everything
12616	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	If you wash and condition your hair every day, you won't have dandruff.
12617	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I'm a teenager and I already have too much of hairfall. Past 4 - 5 years a lot of hair has fallen off from my head and it looks a little scanty. I have a really oily scalp and in the past 2 years I have developed dandruff as well.
12618	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Bruhhhhh mine so bad I had to live school like it was just falling but I wash my hair like 5 times a day for 1 week and it's gone 🙃 😫 🙂
12619	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	From experience: 1: Wash your hair thoroughly with an anti-dandruff shampoo, possibly two times in one shower, to get all the current dandruff out. Comb thoroughly for better effect. 2: Rub lemon juice into your scalp. The dandruff bast*rds hate the pH! Repeat once or twice, and even the worst cases will usually see great change. Worked wonders for me, dandruff barely ever came back for over a decade. Let me know how it turns out for you!

12622	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have dandruff pretty bad, and every time I try to treat it, my scalp breaks out SO badly. It drives me mad, so I just stopped fighting it, let it snow I guess.
12623	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I've always heard that consuming too much protein makes it worse. I have hereditary seborrheic dermatitis and if I don't stay on top of it will drive me crazy. When I was a little boy I had it pretty bad and we didn't know what it was, once I went into the army and had my head shaved I got it under control.

12625	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	That doesn't really explain why my dandruff appears when my hair is longer than when short. Nor why I was born with dandruff unless it's not really dandruff.
12626	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I’ve always had dandruff, but this time it’s lasting longer and my hair is falling like crazy. I don’t know if it’s because of dandruff or my hyperthyroidism :(

12628	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Here's a genuine question for you. Why is it that when I use dandruff preventing shampoo, it actually substantially WORSENS my dandruff? While normal shampoos don't seem to affect anything?
12629	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	this one’s easy. hair
12630	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Yay I’m not alone in the world I got my little dudes on my head
12631	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Went to a top dermatologist. He told me he had heaps of people with this issue and that the problem was being caused by Sodium Laurel Sulfate. His suggestion was, 1. Wet hair with warm (not hot) water in the shower and then use Cera Ve moisturising lotion or Conditioner on my scalp and then to rinse it off. 2. To shampoo with non Sulfate Shampoo just the ends once and wash off. 3. Condition all over, then rinse off Been almost five weeks now and I'm pretty much itch/dandruff free. Apparently the anti dandruff shampoos are full of SLS which can over time wear away at our skin and cause us to itch and the skin to flake off. It's worked for me I am not a Dr or medical professional, so please speak to yours about whether it's worth a try for you.
12632	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	you kind of look like the rock sorry
12633	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I had a terrible time with dandruff. It would shed off my scalp like sand, it even went on my eyebrows. I sometimes could pull off a flake from my scalp the size of a corn flake. I could see the red bloody dot in the middle of the dandruff flakes from where it developed at the hair's root. I would sometimes comb it off on to a piece of blank paper to see how much I could collect. The best solution for my scalp was shampoo with coal tar in it, I still use it every blue moon when it acts up. As I have gotten older though it has become much less of a problem. Don't let dandruff take over your scalp, ever. There is a solution to this health problem and combing it off your scalp will only aggravate it.
12634	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Me: mom i have dandruff Mom: all because of your phone 😐 Me: 😃WHSFFGGB HOWW
12635	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	It’s so interesting reading everyone’s experiences. For about 3-4 years of my teenage life I had really bad dandruff and then it completely went away! Now I’m well into my 20s and if I feel my scalp starting to get itchy I just use a scalp exfoliant. It’s so weird that I have hardly any dandruff now when it used to be so bad (if I shook my head it was fricking snowing, what the heck !) now I get the occasional dead skin, which is not even noticeable
12636	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Lol wheres the how to get rid of it part ?
12637	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Don't use shampoo. Whatever you do don't use head and shoulders.
12638	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	My dandruff is so bad that my scalp starts bleeding
12639	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have extremely sensitive skin, I also happen to get dandruff often. Anyone else that has sensitive skin also have dandruff? I wonder if it’s more common in people like that. Just curious.
12640	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have two shampoos, one with coconut oil stuffs and the other with minty feelings. Whenever I use the coconut one, my scalp the next day becomes super itchy and full of flakes (why do I even still have a scalp these days) but with the Minty one, I can go 3 days without shampooing and my scalp isn't itchy at all

12643	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I'm so tired of my itchy scalp that I'm close to just shaving my head. It's been years. I've tried different things and nothing really works.
12644	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	so in short, if you ever feel like you’re worth nothing just know that you’re important to billions of microbes
12645	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	did anyone notice that there head got much more itchier after watching the video or is it just me
12646	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Do I have dandruff or dry scalp?

12648	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Step one: wash your head. Problem solved.
12649	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	It’s candida(yeast), you need antifungal oils like coconut oil. You can also use clove oil but you’ll need a carrier oil like coconut or jojoba, yeast is a LOT more damaging and dangerous than just something that causes dandruff
12650	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Always had dandruff issues, worse with longer hair and far easier to clear when kept extra short. I sweat a lot through my scalp and my face when it's hot or I'm being physically active, again it is far worse when my hair is longer.

12652	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I sweat a lot through my scalp and have a lot of dandruff and consequent hair loss, so this video does justify it. Tried some antifungal shampoos and a lot of other things, but they just don't work.
12653	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I've had these little guys since i was in 3rd grade until 8th grade when they just disappeared and then they come back again after we spent a day out in the sun. When i was younger, i always used those shampoos to kill lice and they would work but my hair would feel so icky later on. I used it a few times at the start of the pandemic and as time passed on i didn't need to use it anymore, just the comb made especially to get out lice. Now after a year i only have a few dandruffs left i guess but no big ones like the lice //Idk the difference//
12654	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have a better question What is dandruff
12655	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Dandruf shampoo causes dandruf.
12656	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Keto helps reduce inflammation so that would be a good place to start
12657	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I had dandruff (dry scalp) in Colorado for 18 years. Tried everything including tea tree oil, coconut oil, Selsun Blue, etc. Recently moved to Arizona and it completely went away without using anything. I love the desert even more now!
12658	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	My 5cents for those with seborrheic dermatitis and frizzy hair: - Use warm or cold water, hot water can irritate the scalp and it opens your hair cuticles (it will dehydrate and look frizzy) - Leave the shampoo work for at least a couple minutes, meanwhile it is important to massage the scalp to stimulate blood flow (which is why it is ok to wash your scalp daily) - Avoid products containing silicone on your scalp!!! Many cases of dandruff are actually seborrheic dermatitis or folliculitis, and silicone will worsen them. The fewer products you apply when washing, the better. - Panthenol comes in many antifungal shampoos and it is enough to help condition your hair. - Your hair is frizzy and you can't stop using conditioner? Then use white vinegar mixed with 1/3 gallon (1L) of filtered water in a ratio of 1:7 to rinse your hair at the end and you will instantly feel how it relaxes (water with higher acidity will help close your hair cuticles and make it look smoother and less prone to breakage) - Damaged hair that needs treatment and dandruff? You can use 1-2 drops of argan oil (it is expensive but you only need that amount), massage the oil in your hand palms, then distribute it to your hair once it is dry without causing friction, and then use the tip of your fingers to massage the scalp. - And most important: let the sunshine on your scalp daily, not only you will enjoy an anti-inflammatory effect, but also has antifungal effects.
12659	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	i used to be a sufferer of bad dandruff and recommend the use of apple cider vinegar diluted with water. I haven't seen a flake in years now since I started using it.
12660	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I used to get dandruff, so switched from standard shampoo to Head and Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo. I then decided to try having my once a daily shower with no shampoo or soap/body wash I.e. just wash myself with water. Skin and scalp are both itch free, with no dandruff on my head.
12661	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	What shampoo use to remove dandruff
12662	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	More like what causes you not to get bitches
12663	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I wonder if there's a correlation to psoriasis and how it keeps spreading and affecting other tissue.
12664	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I regret clicking on this video
12665	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	"and where is ""how do you get rid of it?"""
12666	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	dont use any kind of shampoo , wash your hair with distilled water everyday and acv onnce a week mixed in water, thats work for me , my dandruff gone
12667	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	This actually makes so much sense for me now. My hair is constantly hyper oily as well as being super dandruffy.
12668	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	"In case anyone is wondering what's a good shampoo to get rid of dandruff, the only ""anti - dandruff"" shampoo I've used that works is Neutrogena T/Gel coal tar shampoo (I use the extra strength one) Just only use the shampoo on your scalp and gently scrub it in. Also make sure you use a moisturizing conditioner on just the ends of your hair after since it can be very drying (I have a oily scalp so, I didn't see much dryness after)"
12669	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Did anyone scratch their head while watching this? 🙋🏾‍♀️
12670	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Another example of doctors coming up with treatments instead of solutions! The health of our skin is a direct reflection of the health of our internal world, particularly our gut. Skin problems like acne, eczema, or dandruff, are reflections of an imbalance inside. Lets treat things proactively! Why is my body reacting in this strange way? Often it comes from our inputs, aka food and drinks. This could be different for everyone but common things are sugar, dairy, or gluten. A billion different factors could play into your overall health. Stress levels or insufficient sleep can mess with you. Even not having fulfilling relationships can be damaging to health. Our body is a system of interlocking parts which function on many different levels. This system operates at its highest capacity when these parts all click together. Maybe our psychology even trains us to be happy when we give ourselves what is good for us on every level! Treat your body right, and maybe one day you'll wake up without dandruff too.
12671	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	My solution, stop using shampoo
12672	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	"If you're like me, and you also have dandruff on your eyebrows and eyelashes, it's because you're dehydrated. No shampoo/oil will help. Too much water is escaping your body vs how much you are consuming. Don't just drink ""liquids"" either, straight up water."
12673	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I had dandruff problem since childhood, but it goes away and sometimes it gets worse. Now my dandruff is under control. First make sure to have proper diet, healthy immune system and good sleep. The common reason of dandruff is dry skin, so make sure to dry your hair properly, the remaining water in your hair needs to dry. Washing your hair regularly is also a good solution
12674	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I thought I had dandruff for the longest time, but I actually just had dry skin (seborrheic dermatitis). I went to my local doctor and prescribed clobestol which is a topical steroid to reduce inflammation. It burns upon application and is only a treatment but my itchy scalp, dryness and flakes go away for about a month. It’s hard to distinguish between the 2, but like the video said, dandruff thrives off oil, and since I thought my scalp was always reddish/inflamed I thought I just had to get it more oily (I even applied coconut oil), which obviously led to more dandruff.
12675	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	ive had dandruff since like 11 and it has been EXCESSIVE like there is so so much of it, whenever i oil my hair my shirt ends up covered completely in dandruff, i was bullied about it for 3rd - 6th grade about it, its better now but still a lot, the only advice the doctor gave me is to shampoo everyday and use a reasonable amount while doing so
12676	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I've had dandruff ever since I can remember, and the only thing that I have tried that works is Head and Shoulders products (I'm assuming products with similar ingredients work just as effectively although I haven't needed to try anything else).. Other shampoo and conditioner products still leave my scalp flaking after using them. Long story short, H&S is a miracle.
12677	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I just got a chunk of dandruff from my hair while watching this :(
12678	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Moral of the story i can’t get lice ✊🏿
12679	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	"The video didnt exactly give a solution, so here it is: ""low blood levels of zinc, niacin (vitamin B3), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) may be factors "". You're welcome to research deficiencies in diet, it may be different for many people. Dandruff and your nails tell you a lot about your nutrition deficiencies."
12680	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	It’s from the foods we eat. Follow the Candida diet for 60 days and dandruff will disappear.
12681	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I think a helpful analogy is thinking about a garden. What happens when you have bare soil? Weeds are the first to arrive. People see them as annoying, but really they serve a purpose to protect the bare soil. over time as a more diverse group of plants come in, they will replace the weeds to return to a healthy, balanced, diverse ecosystem. Yeast in your body is the same. If you are lacking the balanced microbial ecosystem, the yeast will come in and take over to protect the “bare soil”. So really, the answer to dandruff is to restore a balanced microbial ecosystem, not fight and destroy the yeast. They will just keep coming back. The million dollar question is how do you restore a balanced microbial ecosystem in and on your body. The things that have been most effective for me, after trying many, many things, were the basics. Sleep well, eat well, be active, get sunlight, reduce stress.
12682	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Exactly why I have been shaving my head since I was a kid. My dandruff goes away as long as I keep my head shaved, if my hair grows out more than a quarter inch, I look like a snow globe. I believe my scalp being exposed to the sunlight kills off the yeast, that's my theory.
12683	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I used to have a big, dense afro, and dandruff like crazy. A few years ago I cut my hair down realy short and, boom, dandruff gone. This made me believe that my dandruff was caused by my scalp not being able to 'breathe' due to thick hair. Oh well🤷🏽‍♀️
12684	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I was born a raised in Tennessee, I had really bad dandruff my whole life, and tried every remedy there was for it, but the only thing that had lasting effect was as soon as I left the state my dandruff would go away. I wonder if there is something about where you live that affects an induvial rate of developing dandruff.
12685	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I’ve had bad psoriasis outbreaks on my scalp. I originally thought it was dandruff. Anti-dandruff shampoos did little to control it. I still had itching and flaking. I found out it was psoriasis & switched to anti-psoriasis shampoos, which helped control symptoms. TL;DR: Not all scalp itching & flaking is dandruff. It could be caused by another skin condition.
12686	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	When I eat too much sugar or wheat flour... Dandruff starts to strongly appear... It is also related to Peak blood sugar... Most diseases appear due to something we are doing wrong... Let's not attack the consequences, better the causes Dandruff it's because what we eat
12687	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	The treatment for Malassezia or better still Pityriasis Capitis Simplex is simple. The ph in every product you use when washing your hair alters, as does the ph in your water. Sticking with one product only mostly produces dandruff. As a barber for 40 years, I asked my customers to increase the variety used when washing hair, the results were immediate and long lasting. Never use the same product twice if you suffer from dandruff, yeast is easy to remove, brush your hair before shampooing or better still in the shower but it this constant moving of your skins natural ph and the ph of the water and the product. Keep changing the product everyday, no build up of yeast. It works and costs zero.
12688	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Dandruff is caused for all chemicals in the water 💦 here in USA
12689	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Dandruff tends to appear more if you spend most of your time in a cold environment like a air conditioned place. I never had problems with dandruff back in my country until I got to the States. I realized that I spend more time under the cold than I walk around back in my country. I theorize that the more prominent cause of dandruff appearing more frequently is due to colder environments.
12690	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	So how do we get rid off it !?
12691	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I've been struggling with dandruff my entire life. I have even tried prescription shampoos. And I shampoo 4 days a week. Maybe I should shampoo more frequently? But my hair gets super dry when I shampoo more than 4 days a week.
12692	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Where is how to get rid of it?
12693	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have terrible dandruff in winter.
12694	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Can you make bread with that head fungus tho?
12695	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Wash your hair everyday WITHOUT shampoo
12696	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Apply Castor oil and trust me in 3 days there is no sign of dandruff.
12697	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Short answer: You can't get rid of it, you can only control it
12698	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	So dandruff is good but people think it’s bad because of their style or looks.
12699	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	wash your hair with vinegar, burns but it keeps you dandruff and itch free- repeat daily in the beginning and then a few times a week for maintaince
12700	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Joseph seems like a really chill creative dude, it's shame nutjobs ruined his story, with how huge ARGs and such are now I wonder if he'd ever try again.
12701	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	As someone who has had bad ichy dandruff my entire life this was informative. P.s. original vaseline has virtually eliminated all the symptoms of dandruff and acts like styling gel without the drying out effect that makes dandruff worse.
12702	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Wait so kf I shower alot will it die or will I always have Dandruff
12703	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I’m more worried about the legos embedded in my head than the dandruff now.
12704	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	For people that are fighting dandruff, rotate 5-6 shampoos and one of them must be medicated. Get your doctor to prescribe it. The rest can be zinc, tar, ginger, and other shampoos. Do not use head and shoulders, that does not work. As this video said, the fungi communicates with the immune system. The more frequent you use one shampoo, the more you develop immunity to it. I learned about this late and developed an immunity to Body Shop’s GINGER shampoo which worked for me before like a charm but developed an immunity to it because I used it everyday.
12705	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	"I remember one time when I was 13. I was having a shower and I had washed my hair. I woke up the next day to discover that there was a bit of shampoo still on my hair that I hadn't rinsed out and it had dried up into some sort of white flakes. Since then, I've been called things like ""Dandy"" and ""Snowman"" at school. Is that dandruff?"
12706	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Fellow people who don't have greasy hair, but often get dry scalp: do NOT use Head and Shoulders. Its intention is to remove dandruff, but not for dry scalp dandruff. You'll have an even drier scalp which will cause much more shedding. Instead look for more natural products like Aussie or Hot Six Oil, or diluted Tea Tree oil.
12707	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	On 23andMe it states that people that have a decent amount of Neanderthal DNA in them are also prone to dandruff, so my take is that it could all just be genetics
12708	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Fought dandruff for 13 years before I realised buying synthetic products was the issue. Switched to only using warm water and organic oils like olive oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil. Made my hair manageable, healthy, and dandruff free. Also, my hair stopped falling out.
12709	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Apple cider vinagre. One day yes, the other no. Repeat this until the dandruff goes away. Mother taught.
12710	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	my mom and i were literally just talking about this today and now i get this recommended 😳
12711	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	The #1 cause is diet. I found that when I was eating healthy and limited myself on fatty foods my dandruff went away. The moment I started eating junk food again it came back. Your body produces a lot of oils when you eat junk. Same thing occurs with acne.
12712	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I remember one time my mom recommended I try some type of oil to help with the dandruff and I had most painful night of my life. Serious itching made me scratch my scalp non stop to the point that I had some bleeding spots.
12713	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Dude, not shampooing my hair gets rid of my dandruff, shampooing almost everyday is what fcked me up
12714	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have been having dandruff all my life and I tried everything I could. It really affects the lifestyle. I guess dandruff cannot be cured but can only be treated. I made peace with the fact that I have to keep fighting it until I get bald or I die.
12715	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	"""If you could eradicate body odor or bad breath, which would it be?""... i mean both of these are pretty easy to keep away. Wear merino, alpaca, or cashmere wool clothing and you wont build up stink for days. Wash your self properly and brush your mouth and tongue thoroughly. Super easy. I hardly ever stink even after working out."
12716	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I used to link dandruff with an dry scalp so when my swim seasons started it would confuse me every year when my dandruff would go away. Now I’m just convinced chlorine kills everything
12717	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Repent to Jesus Christ! “The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul. The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭19:7‬ ‭NIV‬‬
12718	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	"Its interesting how they just stop at ""use anti-dandruff shampoo"" - I dont think it's only genetic. I used shampoo that my dermatologist gave for a few months, and then I got so tired of using this medicated shampoo, I started using all kinds of fruits that I normally eat. I applied orange juice on my scalp, banana, avocado, aloe, mayo and what not and then I noticed I don't have so much of a dandruff problem anymore. I think shampoos are not the only solution, just the shampoo industry wants us to believe sadly."

12720	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have dandruff since 4th grade and about 7th grade it started growing on my face. Now I am 20 years old and still have dandruff. I tried whatnot and some days my scalp is clear and some is not..
12721	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Salicylic acid shampoos and conditioners are my dandruff weapons of choice because SA penetrates through the oils, chemically exfoliates the scalp and kills the bacteria. Head & Shoulders type shampoos rarely work long term for me, but the zinc is good for soothing inflamed scalps. For your health. ;)

12724	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	No wonder this was an issue in my youth but not after puberty. I have cut down on dandruff shampoo and condition my hair afterwards with coconut oil which is a natural anti-fungi, anti-inflammatory, and I believe a mild anti-itch.
12725	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	well.... if your mobile phone uses the 5G you definitely have dandruff.

12727	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I hope they find a new cure cuz I can't keep living like this fr
12728	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	i used to suffer from an extreme case of dandruff untill 2 weeks ago when i finally discovered my cure has always existed in my kitchen after buying every shampoo out there, here it is, garlic, onion and ginger mix them together in a blender with clean filtered water ( a bottle of water from the store would do, apply the mix to your scalp once a day for as long as you can ( i personally leave it for at least 9 hours) then rinse it off with clean cold water ( yes cold water from your fridge), it'll hurt a bit but it's a must and that is it, garlic and onion have anti-microbial properties and ginger boosts blood circulation to the scalp ( look'em all up individually if you must, it's working miraculously for me
12729	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Great, now i can go to sleep knowing we have purple bugs in our hair

12732	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I used to be a barber and ive only seen 3 things that work for dandruff or dry itchy scalp from dry skin in winter. 1. When you shower wet your hair thoroughly, Take a handful of Epsom Salt and put it on your head and massage the salt into your scalp GENTLY careful not to get into your eyes. Wet hair again and shampoo throughly with a MEDICATED shampoo. 2. Do NOT use the same shampoo for over 2 or 3 weeks, SWITCH out to a different shampoo often. Your scalp becomes immune to the same shampoo over time. Don’t use the MEDICATED shampoos all the time either every single day, switch often. 3. DO NOT touch your scalp with your fingernails, fingernails carry bacteria underneath them and can infect your scalp when scratching.

I have dry skin but for a while i thought i had dandruff. I used dandruff shampoo but it actually made it worse! Then i googled and figured i had dry skin, not dandruff. So figure that out first, you dont wanna make it worse! 👍🏼❤️
12755	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	After watching this video, I started using shampoo everyday.😂😂😂

12757	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	So I got root canal and hence the dentist put crown on my tooth (a few months back) which recently fell off.... I was wondering if someone would develop something that could help teeth grow back (and wonder why they just don’t do naturally?) (For this I think they can make some process like of hair transplant in which collagen is injected and hence giving signal to brain to grow hair in that area particularly.) Either way it could really be a game changer for the whole dental industry and dental aestheticians.

12760	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	actual tips? - Don't use head and shoulders if it doesnt work' ( I use baby shampoo ). - Lather your shampoo until bubbly then apply to hair gently ( ROOTS ONLY & not with your nails ). - Wash it off, then apply conditioner to your ends only. ( it damn helps ) - Then wash, don't leave hair damp and don't wrap your hair with a towel please. -If using blow dryer try not to make it hot, cold is better ( ye, ik it takes time ). -If using a comb afterwards then use a comb that won't make use hair hurt. ( I use a paddle brush/all purpose comb ) Like if this worked so people can see it :)

12763	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	YouTube knows me too well. I've been experiencing dandruff on my scalp more than ever lately and I've switched between 3 shampoos these past few months thinking that might be the culprit, aside from the fact that I am going through puberty and experiencing hormonal changes. I was just watching a video regarding the Central Dogma for my Science class and I see a video about Dandruff which of course intrigued me and made me leave the video I was watching midway. Now, I found this really weird for Central Dogma and Dandruff are not really that related, apart from the mention of DNA once in this video. Anywho, this video was amazing and cleared quite a lot of things for me. Thank you!!!

12797	188	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	"Short answer: Neutrogena T-Gel. Long answer: If you're like me you've tried a lot of shampoos that are marketed towards dandruff, yet for most of my life none of them have worked. The fact of the matter is that the yeast mentioned in this video is only one of several different possible causes of dandruff, so shampoos targeted against the yeasts may still not help you. I did eventually find ONE shampoo that gets rid of dandruff for me, though. Neutrogena's T-gel. It's literally the only product that has worked for me, and is recommended by the National Psoriasis Foundation, and people with Psoriasis can get extreme dandruff so a recommendation from this organization should be listened to. Use it everyday for a few weeks. It'll take a few weeks to kick in, and then you have to use it regularly but you can at least cut back to using it just a few times a week, but you'll be thankful for it. Also, put it in your hair at the start of the shower and leave it in for a few minutes before you rinse it out. It doesn't smell pleasant, but if you follow it up with like a mint conditioner afterwards you'll be fine. I bothered to write this long comment because I had BAD dandruff and I want to help anyone else out there who was like me. The active ingredient that makes it work is coal tar extract, which accoeding to Web-MD, ""belongs to a class of drugs known as keratoplastics. It works by causing the skin to shed dead cells from its top layer and slow down the growth of skin cells. This effect decreases scaling and dryness. Coal tar can also decrease itchiness from these skin conditions."" You can look up other products that use this but Neutrogena T-Gel is found practically anywhere. It's in a box at the store so just look out for that."
12798	189	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	You can remove your dandruff with just two ingredients..even i tried the method 3 days ago, and it was flawless. Just take a bowl of yogurt(organic) and squeeze one lemon on it and apply on ur scalp and leave it for 20 minutes...and then rinse it off with your daily shampoo it really worked for me

12827	218	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	So, in other words, it's caused by a yeast that eats the saturated fats of the skin oils and triggers the clumping of cells. and it also helps prevent harmful microbes from taking host since they are already living there. They basically benefit us since besides some dandruff, they kinda act like another defense mechanism.

12830	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	For all those out here struggling with dandruff or a dry scalp, search up “apple cider vinegar rinse for scalp” on YouTube. I’ve tried expensive shampoos, treatments, etc. and nothing has worked to restore my scalp except for ACV +water in a spray bottle. There’s a strong smell from the ACV initially before you wash but it’s better than endlessly being itchy!
12831	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Meanwhile, people that shave their heads and bald people:
12832	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have dry dandruff, who knows how to treat it?
12833	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Anti dandruff shampoo works but they can't be used too often as its ingredients can damage the hair. Hair oil works best, it doesn't kill the bacteria but it prevents the dandruff from falling off on your shoulders.
12834	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Finally. My parents will say finally agree to buy me an anti fungal shampoo. I can just show them this video.
12835	226	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	The microbe is a yeast But we use an anti fungal shampoo?
12836	227	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I have lots of dandruff and my brother says it looks like it is snowing when I scratch my head. Lol 😂
12837	228	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I hate how chronic this is. Nothing I've tried has worked for long.
12838	229	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	When I scratch my head it looks like it's snowing... 😭

12841	232	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I just ordered a dandruff shampoo 2 hours before this video. TedEd is stalking me 😀😅
12842	233	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	So, dandruff isn't harmful for health nor the scratching it causes right?? Pls someone answer it...
12843	234	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	When I was at elementary school, I always believed that dandruffs are a myth because kids my age would prank others by spreading small crumbles of ripped papers to their hair. XD

You can spray it to your scalp after shower. - Try to use a different shampoo in every 2-3 months. I mean don’t use the same shampoo whole year. - Don’t use too much shampoo while you’re having a shower. - Don’t wash your hair everyday. - wash your hair with cold water at the end - And Last but not least WASH YOUR HANDS
12849	240	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	Wow! I really was trying to get rid of dandruff and was searching for a good shampoo for that. Idk how Ted ed knew about it! And whola! They made a video!

12857	248	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DUOokXZAo	I am not that bothered by it, because if you take showers regularly - it's no biggie, but the constant feeling of itching just torments me. Even in my sleep I scratch myself and I noticed that I lose water really fast while at work.

12906	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	My dad had a heart attack back in 2020. One of the reasons was the stress, because a few weeks earlier we had a strong earthquake, and corona situation. He said that the lighting darkened, and that he felt his chest swelling, and couldn't move. I was having an online class, and had my camera and microphone off because I was crying. He recovered really fast, and was back in 3 weeks. I now truly appreciate the time we all spend together. He quit smoking a few years earlier, and doesn't eat breakfast, but overly eats lunch. I hope anybody who is going through the same situation I went trough knows that they aren't alone, and that they should stay strong. Love to everybody

12918	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	I lost my dad to this. I heard him cough heavily so I ran to his room to check found him lying livelessly, his skin had turned pale and purple. I wanted to do CPR but didn't know how to. 20 minutes later the ambulance came and announced that he was gone due to a heart attack. I've been wondering if I could have saved him, had I known how to perform CPR.
12919	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	Had these repeated nausea moments last month and after seeing these kinda videos went in panic mode , doctor took blood samples and found out high level of glucose. No more soda and much less sugar in the diet and I'm already seeing the results , no more nausea and my pee is much less yellow than it used to be , next test in a couple of weeks to see the results , fingers crossed. 🤞🏽
12920	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	I am 35 and just found out two days ago I had a heart attack. My symptoms were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sweating and hot/cold flashes. No chest pain or difficulty breathing. I thought I was doing all the right things. Eating right, I’m pretty active, I had quit smoking and drinking. I am under a LOT of stress. Idk. But please don’t think it can’t happen to you. I don’t know what is scarier. Having a heart attack, or having a heart attack and not knowing it. And right in from of my daughter.
12921	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	it's so crazy how doctors can take another artery, and replace it in the HEART, keeping a patient alive. IT'S– wow. mad respect to doctors out there.

12923	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	My father faced heart attack back in 2011. It was a horrifying situation. He used to love red meet and smoke cigarette sometimes in his younger days, also gained some weight. But on that night he was highly tensed for some reason that I won't share. As his description: Had severe pain in left side of chest Jaws were stuck and couldn’t be opened easily Vomiting occurred Eyesight became blurry And Headaches also. It occurred in like 10 PM and we thought that was just a gastric pain. He vomited, had some pills and went to sleep. But at last couldn’t resist himself from pain, called our neighbour for help. Went to local hospital. Tested ECG and doctors indeed took good care of his emergency situations. Tests found he had two blockages in his heart, one is above 80% and other is like 45%. In a week, he had a to get a cardiovascular ring to clear the blockage. Thanks to almighty he is now 52 and Okay and follow all the rules shown in the video. Though I didn’t know much in that time as I was a 9y/o boy but now I can understand it was serious matter to deal with. I Wish no one gets a heart attack before the age of 60. God Bless everyone.
12924	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	*The video* : The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen deprivation of hurt muscles. *20y/o Me* : Wait! I feel a pang in my heart every once in a while and feels suffocating to breathe for few seconds.

What I felt last night was I had a sudden palpitation that lasted for seems like <20s.My chest feels like it was squeezing and my mind almost went blank, I had shortness of breath, a feeling that there is a lump in my throat and I felt so weak that I collapsed on the floor. I have never been so scared in my life that I cried. I thought I was dying for a moment.

I was made to believe there was no cure by medical doctors, but now I believe otherwise because my son was cured from epilepsy late 2020. I came across reviews about how someone got cured of epilepsy with the help from Dr AB. At first I didn't believe because I was not so sure, but I still went ahead to give it a try. I contacted the Doctor and told him everything and he assured me that he will prepare a herbal medicine for me which I will give to my son, and few days after we had this conversation, i made an order and he prepared the medication and sent it to me. After the first month of using the herbals as instructed by the doctor, I took my son for checkup with no assurance but faith, and behold the results came and showed that he was totally free from epilepsy. If you need help with finding a cure for any ailment, you can reach out to this exceptional Doctor on E-mail: powersthathills677@gmail.com Call or WhatsApp + 1 6 0 1 2 0 7 4 5 7 4...

12989	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	I had stomach cramps, A mate at work had just had stomach cramps and been to the doctor, they lasted a couple of weeks and he had the all clear so I assumed I was experiencing the same bug etc. The cramps fluctuated in intensity over a period. After I realized I’d been having the cramps for 3 months I went to the doctor. Blood tests revealed I was anaemic. More bloods and stool tests were taken and I was booked in for a colonoscopy and gastroscopy. After a few weeks I’d still not been allocated the procedures when I had severe stomach cramps. I went back to the doctor and I was pushed through as urgent. I had my colonoscopy and gastroscopy the next week. The colonoscopy revealed a 6cm tumor in my transverse colon. A few days later biopsy results confirmed it as cancerous. I was booked in for surgery the following week, December 13, But I never have the faith in surgery, I remained positive throughout my whole journey seeking Cure and just tried to be sensible, get enough nourishment, rest and workout when I can. Trying to keep my body strong and keep my life as normal as possible i.e. keep working, maintain the same weight, keep enjoying the same things. I tried to be open and talk about it a lot as I don’t see any reason to be private about it. I think realistically everyone’s going to have some experience with cancer at some point in their life, if not personally then someone they know, someone close to them, so I think it was important to talk about it, share experiences so it does’t have to be so scary, and the main thing being to encourage people to not sleep on any symptoms. Go see a doctor, get it checked out. For about three years, I battled an intermittent cough. It would turn up in winter and disappear by spring, then I would forget about it. But in the autumn of 2016, it came early. In October. In January 2017, I saw the doctor, who ran several tests, including a chest CT, which revealed a small nodule in my lung’s right lower lobe. A little over three months later, I had a repeat CT scan. The results came in just before Memorial Day weekend, and the doctor recommended surgery to remove the nodule. I decided I wanted to get a second opinion. I stated seeking answer with Herbal herbs because I knew there will be a cure somehow. I did a lot of research on Dr Harvey and other Herbalist and I came in contact with Dr Harvey who got me cured. I contact him due to a testimony of a lady who was having same issue as mine, She was cured and I told myself this is my time to be free from this illness. There are lot to say but I will love to advice anyone going through any time of pain in his or her heart to always ask question and seek for opinion you don't know the answer might just be next to you. If anyone has any illness or disease contact Dr Harvey via WhatsApp; +1 475 522 1289 I want to anyone suffering from Cancer to contact Dr Harvey via @drharvey_gram http://drharveyherbalworld.blogspot.com All thanks to him that I didn't give up on life.

I tried to open my door to cry out for help but the pain was too strong and couldn’t move.I started to hear a loud ringing noise and started to see a bright white light in front of my face as I was about to die in the dream. I woke up scared out of my mind. Every time I get a weird chest pain I think about that dream and it’s makes me paranoid and scared. I think knowing how bad the pain was is the main reason why I get scared out of my mind because it will eventually happen In real life.

Aspirin is an anti-platelet drug that prevents platelet aggregation and accumulation within the atherosclerotic plaque that might cause cardiovascular complications.

13044	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	I kindly have some questions and would like to get some advice then. What is that inflammation in the heart that's connected to that blockage? I don't know if that's good and if it is, I would like to know why or why it isn't good for me. I'm an 18 year old boy who will probably spend half of his life in front of the computer and be gaming. I have recently found out a small chest pain, left side where I would also sometimes have to breath more because of it I guess. I have been experiencing this from an earlier age too when I was about 10, 12 or 15. I have been working out in fitness but that ended a decade ago when I was about 15 - 14 years old. Is it time to work hard again?

13059	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM	I think I had a heart attack a few months ago, but I haven't told anybody. I was just laying down minding my own business and then suddenly my heart felt like it was getting squeezed. I started to have trouble breathing, everyone else was asleep and I didn't wake them up. The next morning, when I woke up and I still felt the same, except I got so dizzy I couldn't even walk straight. While I was walking down the hallway, I collapsed and knocked a chair down. Still, nobody noticed me and I also didn't call for help. It hasn't happened since then. I don't really wanna be a burden to my family, especially to my mom. We already have enough problems. I know I should tell them, but I just can't for some reason.

At the beginning they mention how old age is a factor but they fail to explain why, and this begins some problems and may raise fallacies from their explanation: 1. This fails to explain that a heart-attack is not a natural occurrence, and in fact is a problem in countries that have a high rate of meat and animal product consumption, whereas in populations with low meat and animal product consumption, heart attacks are almost non-existent. 2. They fail to mention that the plaque formed in our arteries is because of cholesterol consumption along with saturated fat, in which cholesterol can only be obtained through animal and animal product consumption, apart from our body creating our own cholesterol which is all we need in cases apart from patients who do not produce enough cholesterol on their own, which are very few cases in the populace. And 3.This fails to explain that there are heart attacks occurring in middle-aged, or younger populations today than they really should. They fail to mention the correlation of how chicken is now being linked to obesity, and obesity, as we know, greatens the risk of heart attack. Somehow chicken is still mentioned in it's consumption to avoid heart attacks though. The other reservations I have are that, although they did a great job in explaining the processes of surgery, this video points much towards surgery, technology, and pharmaceuticals as being basically the most effective means towards dealing with heart attacks. Although surgery and technology has allowed us to save patients who have had heart attacks already, as I had earlier mentioned, prevention of heart attacks is very reachable through a diet very low or non-existent in meat and animal product consumption, and pharmaceuticals, although they can greatly help mitigating risks of another heart attack, they have their own risks associated with taking pharmaceuticals whereas eating a healthy diet high in fruits and vegetable/legume consumption has no risk associated and can stop a heart attack from occurring once again or at all. This video does not do diet justice and therefore does not inform to the extent that they could about how avoiding heart attacks are some of the most basic actions we can participate in, this goes along with how fruits and vegetables are slightly mentioned, but legumes and beans, which would otherwise replace the meat consumption of American diets is not explained whatsoever. The last piece of diet in which they failed to explain is that eggs, which are high in cholesterol and thus linked to the plaque build up of our arteries, should be avoided in order to prevent hypertension and heart attacks. Other diseases that can be obtained through animal product consumption such as fish and chicken are not mentioned as well but once again, this video was informal in explaining the process of a heart attack and the process of surgery associated.

If they die because they are lazy fucks i have no compassion with them tbh. They are just like smokers but smokers are far worse.

13228	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Today was my first day attending face to face classes in 2 years! Not to mention I have social anxiety.. I really thought I was having a heart attack! I was dizzy, my chest was throbbing and some parts of my body felt numb! It was a good thing though that when it happened I went straight to the bathroom so no one could see me. I just stood there for a couple of minutes till it was gone.😞😞 I cried.. I don't want to experience it again😥
13229	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I just started getting panic attack this month...this is probably because my father died 4 months ago.. usually when I'm having a panic attack I used to feel like it's the same way he felt when he was dying
13230	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	😑😑😑
13231	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I just had my first panic attack yesterday at work. I was doing my job when I feel like I can't breathe then my heart beats faster than normal. I'm getting anxious each moment then suddenly, my hand feels numb then it ran through my whole body. I thought I'm getting a heart attack but it wasn't. I was so scared. My boss rush me to the Hospital ER because I wasn't moving. Unfortunately, I'm still alive. I thought I was going to die, which I want for the last 6 years.
13232	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Thank you. I've been going mad with fear and whenever i look at my hands i see blood. I've also been randomly falling in crowded areas, hearing the voices extra loud.
13233	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’ve recently been having panic attacks for the past 2 years. I’m 36 years old now. The first one was at a dental office where I literally got super hot out of the blue, couldn’t stay still, felt like I needed fresh air or else I would die/faint smh. It got so bad that I really felt like I was going to pass out and so I ran out the back door of the office for fresh air. Mind you I was in the dentist chair while I got up and ran out (felt very embarrassed after) so once I made it out the back door I just stood there and felt much better. Every employee also ran after me and was scared because they didn’t know what was going on. They kept asking me what’s wrong, what’s wrong? I’m like idk but I got super hot and I felt like I was going to faint. So that was my first panic attack. My 2nd and 3rd happen again at the same dental office amd the 4th happen at a hospital right before I had to take a blood test. Are these symptoms considered anxiety panic attacks or is it something else? Idk what it is BUT I really want to get it fix because it’s very embarrassing. Please help! THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!!! Also It feels like I’m out of air and couldn’t breathe.

13236	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I never had panic attacks in 28 years of life, then they started this Summer (I had up to 3 panic attacks in the same night!) along side depressive episodes. But my hands don't go numb, on the contrary I can't stop their shaking, or better I can, but it's like trying not to scratch yourself while itching
13237	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	All I will say is since I've switched to Alkaline vegan lifestyle, I have not experienced any anxiety/panic. RESEARCH DR.SEBI, mental health has more to do with what you eat than you know. Peace, love, and health ❤
13238	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’ve had five panic attacks total, and had my fifth today. I was sitting in art class and I started laugh crying (I was actually upset) and then I couldn’t breathe. People didn’t know I have panic attacks, so they were all laughing at me until they realized I really couldn’t breathe. My friend who sat in front of me said I was shaking and my face looked blue. It truly was the worst I’ve had, and I never knew it could happen for practically no reason.
13239	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Does anyone have panic attacks that start with pain in the head? Thinking that you might get a Brain infarction? It starts like this and then ends up in breathing wrong and raised Heartbeat... Most of the time in public transport or busy places standing still. Prayers for you all in the same situation. If you have tips, please react!

13242	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	A few days ago I experienced my first panic attack. I was simply scrolling through tiktok and suddenly I felt this huge fear come out of nowhere. I started hyperventilating and having nausea. Then my chest began to hurt, well actually I wouldn't describe it that way, it was more like my chest was empty and someone was trying to pull it apart (if that even makes sense). The thing is that I have no idea why this happened and I'm scared that I will continue to have panic attacks. Sorry for the rant lol
13243	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i had my first ever panic attack 2 hours ago. it felt like the world was spinning and shrinking. it felt like my lungs were shrinking also. it felt like my brain was being flooded with clouds, yet i was still in the moment.

13246	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I just had panic attack like 30mins ago 🥲
13247	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I suffered from panic attacks before and I was so scared from the thoughts because it’s made me suffer from a panic attack over and over , but now I’m not scared cause now I understand it , I’m so so so grateful to Lubnah al-khamees she taught me about panic attacks she literally saved my life , when I was suffering it was so harsh on me I felt the hardest feeling ever I felt alone and believed that i will die and I lived but i was dying inside , didn’t feel anything good I was just suffering so bad and no one understands me even myself and I can’t explain the feeling it just continued for a 40 day and it ends but starting again until I finally understand it uuuhhh thank god it ends I’m crying right now and anytime I remember my case
13248	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Explaining me how to understand and stop a panic attack, with this creppy animation, just literally almost gives me a panic attack!
13249	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've just had it twice in a day today few hours ago, I couldn't share it to anyone cause they don't understand and I feel truely alone.
13250	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	It was so severe I was literally preparing for death for three months. My brain thinks Im going die NO MATTER WHAT, no matter how much I convinced myself it's not, it was so unreasonable, and illogical thought process, very *irrational*, I couldn't stop it even if I wanted to, and I wanted it to stop so very much. Literally, my brain was in MOURNING mode for days automatically and controling it wasnt in the options (Mourning myself like Im already dead? Funny really but this was really a very serious issue). does anyone experience this? Dont worry after 3 months of torture my mom thought it was GERD (uhh something about acid reflux but often amd its destroying the food passage) and a doctor confirmed it. Ever since not eating my trigger foods there was MASSIVE improvement now. I rarely get panic attacks, when I do it's because Im stubborn to eat some of my trigger foods. But its not that level anymore, sometimes tho it can be near
13251	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Reading the comments made me want to share my story too. I’ve had about 3 major panic attacks in my 25 years but my last attack was my worst. It lasted about an hour or two maybe more and it worried my family so much that I ended up in the hospital at night. The doctor said it was a panic attack but I already knew because I had researched before when I had my first attack. Earlier in the afternoon I went to see my friends and we smoked weed in their car. I’ve been a frequent smoker for years and never had a problem until then. I drank an energy drink before meeting up with them. I’ve been stressing over everything in my life, it’s been the worst I ever felt, my grandma passed away from cancer, my car broke down again, I was fighting a court case, I lost my job from Covid and was unemployed. My anxiety was overflowing and I bottled up everything. My panic attack started when we were driving and smoking, I lost my phone a few days ago so I couldn’t even keep myself from overthinking. My friends helped me calm down I felt like I was a burden to them, but they reassured me I wasn’t. My friend parked the car and I stepped outside the car for some fresh air. My heart was jumping out my chest and I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I felt like I was dying from the inside out, like I was sinking with no way out. I was looking up at the sky asking myself “what’s wrong with me?” , “why am I like this?” , why can’t I just be normal?”. My best friend who is like a brother to me stepped out the car and hugged me. He told me “everything’s alright you’re gonna be alright”. It was cold outside and snowing so we went back inside the car even tho I felt trapped in the backseat but I asked my friend if I could hold his hand while we all talked to help me relieve my stress and make me feel better which I did. I did feel better after but I asked them if they could take me home so I can feel more comfortable. I went home and stayed in my room. I don’t know what happened but it happened again. I ended up calling my family and they drove me to the hospital. Now I stopped smoking weed because it made my anxiety and stress worse. I stopped drinking energy drinks and lowered my caffeine intake. I decided to open up more about how I’m feeling because I’m only human. I stopped having panic attacks since then but I still worry about it. My point is surround yourself with friends and family who understand and want to understand what’s happening with you. Talk to them and do things that make you truly happy. I focus on my music whenever I feel like I’m dying and I’m trying to better myself.
13252	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have health anxiety so having a panic attack makes my heart hurt and when it hurts I immediately think I have a heart disease or smth and it just makes me panic more, typing this at 3:29 AM while having a panic attack 😭 💀
13253	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my first panic attack experience yesterday. I thought I was dying or having a heart attack. It was such a horrible experience. My boyfriend was in front of me and thanks to him I managed to let him take control of the situation knowing that I'll be taken care of. Idk what I would've gone through if he wasn't there. I had surgery last week and of course with that fear in our heads my dad took me to the ETU to rule out other horrible things. I was fine but I wasn't at the same time. Then the doctors explained to me it was a panic attack and everything in my body is normal. Now I'm trying to learn about panic attacks so I'll know what to do in the future. Now I'm scared of getting a panic attack. Any advice on how to get over these fears?

13255	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Ever since i had my first panic attack back in 2020 i was no longer the same person. It took something from me mentally & Physically I have been trying my hardest to fight it but it can be really hard especially having no support and you feel like no one's on your side...
13256	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I don't know what I'm feeling most of the days My heart starts to race, I suddenly feel worried, I start to think of everything that isn't there anymore and want to text anyone, do anything or cry, but none of that seems to help, then I just feel tired and fall asleep, but then my heart wakes me again and the fear continues. Is that a panic attack? I don't even know what I'm feeling this, I'm coping with it and it's getting better, but it's so overwhelming.
13257	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my first panic attack last week. Everyday now it feels like I’m struggling not to have one. Maybe it’s the fear of having another one, or maybe it’s my subconscious. I’ve noticed they happen when I’m about to go to bed, not sure why. But honestly I hope it stops
13258	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	From someone with anxiety,here some tips to stop a panic attack: The “Five things you can see” thing works pretty well. Try it for sure. If you have some gum or even better,a mint,pop one in your mouth. Focus on the sharp,refreshing flavor and not the fear. If tears start coming,and you get that annoying ache in your throat and you KNOW stuff is about to go down,hold your breath,count to 5 think of your favorite song,curl your tounge,tap your toes. Do anything to stimulate your hands,feet and senses reason: activating all of your senses and body parts will give you many things to focus on and not the fear. Unless you get sensory issues in which case…. Get up and take a couple laps around the area. Srry if that’s bad advice I don’t really get sensory overload so don’t know much about it. And those are things that worked on me. Everyone develops they’re own ways to stop panic attacks in the end of the day tho I suppose
13259	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	having one right now. having sugar always helps me.
13260	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've only ever had 2 panic attacks in my life, but I remember them so vividly that I feel sorry for anyone that has chronic panic attacks. Just the feeling of hyperventilating but you feel like you're suffocating while the room spins and your heart is trying to keep up for no reason is possibly one of the worst feelings in the world. I also hate just feeling anxious randomly, sometimes for the whole day.
13261	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’ve been dealing with an anxiety disorder for about three years and it’s nice to understand better these panic attacks I get, very helpful
13262	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I suffer from it so far because of the war in Syria. I want a solution because I started wanting to commit suicide
13263	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Hello I watched the video so I would have knowledge about panic attacks. I don't experience them, but I'd like to know how to help people who do. What should I do when a person around me experiences it? Can you guys give me tips about things you do when you experience it? Thank you so much!
13264	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"Idk if this is a panic attack... but I remember last year I had such bad anxiety my body would physically be paralyzed and hyperventilating to the point my body and lungs would hurt but I would just ""wake up"" wherever I was in that paralyzed, hyperventilating state nd not remember how or when I got there or what I was doing which made it scarier... I was in a program at the time and it would only happen when I was at the house... it got so bad it started happening like every other day... once I realized the house was my trigger but I seemed ok in my room, I stopped leaving my room... didn't eat cause I was too afraid to leave my room and ppl said I was being ""lazy"" if i asked them 2 bring me something... I only used the bathroom at work... and I would literally leave and come in through my window cause I was too afraid 2 even leave my room 2 get 2 the door... if I even walked near my bedroom door I would start freaking out nd hyperventilating"
13265	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm extremely anxious about everything, all the time, every minor detail every single aspect everyone who looks at me, someone who laughs in the distance literally anything will send my mind racing into impossible routes that my brain is trying to convince me is completely plausible - yes they're laughing at you, yes they're talking about you, yes you're not special. What talents do you really have? What makes you, you? Nothing of course literally nothing makes you, you because you dont have anything special. you're completely worthless with no goals desires or talents and you're not going to go anywhere but that's okay, because you don't even want to go anywhere, but the constant feeling of disappointing everyone around you is so intense that you have to try to go somewhere or atleast stay stable but it's not something you have any real reason or motive for so you're not doing anything for yourself but for others and you start pushing away all of your friends because you dont want them to judge you but you know deep down they don't really judge you but what if you vanished for a week, or two, or a month? and not a single one of those friends you believed cared for you have even thought to check up on you and see how your doing, literally nothing. Maybe there's not much of a point. Yet i've never had a panic attack and I hope to god I never do. I've had moments where my chest suddenly gets really tight and heavy and it feels like i'm going to throw up and my heart starts to feel really tight but I don't think it's ever been a panic attack
13266	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	About a year ago I had intense bouts of panic brought on by existential crises most nights during the winter. I didn't really have any of the physical symptoms described in the video, but the feeling I experienced was probably the most potent feeling I've ever felt and I was terrified of them while I had them. Is this just a more mild panic attack, or is it something else entirely? If someone knows, I'd appreciate an answer. Thank you.
13267	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Stop been weak minded, just deal with it!
13268	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Ive been struggling with severe panic attacks for years and ive recently quit my job, avoided school completely and rarely went outside.knowing everyone else here is going through something similar or has overcame it is really comforting and i'm starting to work up the courage to ask for help
13269	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I know this is serious stuff, but 3:03 😳
13270	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’ve been trying to learn how to not get panic attack. I used to get one once a month. It was really bad and scared me to my core cause I cannot deny that there is nothing wrong. Then it became a few times a year and I’m lucky to only encounter once to thrice a year. I now know when I get panic attacks so it helps “mentally” preparing myself for it if it does happen. It is not as bad as I want to puke or worst, hurt myself. My worst panic attacks usually causes me to harm myself cause my brain is telling me that is the only way it will stop or everything will stop. The only thing that sucks when I encounter one is the after effects. It feels like walking on thin ice that when it breaks I’ll drown from all of these emotions that I have learned to control. I don’t have proper diagnosis as this is what in my culture believes isn’t real. That everything is made up by your head so I can’t get the proper help. But I do think it is partially PTSD and OCD. My OCD was caused by that PTSD so if everything is not going on a certain way I perceived should happen my brain is sending signal that everything is wrong and I should start panicking. When it happens I just tell myself that I’m fine and everything is okay even though it is not really fine and I am not okay with what is happening. I don’t have proper support myself but I cannot give in and lose to whatever it is that is wrong. I only have one wish, I hope this ends cause I’m tired. I’m just really tired but I won’t do it cause insurance does not cover suicide so not an option. I don’t want to live long though. I don’t see the fun or purpose.
13271	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Until recently, I had at least five to ten panic attacks a day. Ever since I was a child. I don’t have them as frequently now, because I’ve been working hard to cope, but it’s still a daily thing.
13272	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Some panic attacks are associated with the gut, which are impossible to address by mere psychological methods.
13273	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	As the bane of my existence is my skills in the education area, when I forgot my homework once, I had a panic attack because I was so panicked that i was going to get a detention. This is how messed up the school system is. I was shaking, hyperventilating and numbness in my hands for about 30 minutes. I didn't end up getting the detention, but it was an awful experience for me. I sometimes get panic attacks when my parents argue or anyone argues really, since that was one of the worst parts of my childhood. I also hate the thought of passing out or being unconscious because my friend died under anaesthetic when I was 11 and it just built on the fear of sleep or any unconscious state I've had since in was young.I have an iron deficiency, so when I feel dizzy or lightheaded and feel myself drifting, I can sometimes get a panic attack because I can't stand the thought of being unconscious. Same with when I'm about to go to sleep or when I'm having a nightmare. I get nightmares a lot so generally I wake up in a panicked state and since I lucid dream a bit, I often start breathing heavily while I'm dreaming or trying to wake up.
13274	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	It's so great to see a comment section like this, it makes it feel real that panic attacks aren't a lonely thing, to share the experiences I've felt where I think i'm dying, It's something that is hard to share unless someone else has been through it. It's awful, the only perk is you meet a community of people like you. If anyone wants to talk I live in Manchester, UK.
13275	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	They come out of nowhere. I was watching a Disney movie and I was in a good mood. Thats why I thought it was a heart attack. I went to the Er thinking I was having an allergic reaction. They gave me benadryl bc I I said my throat feels like its closing. My heart was racing and I was sitting in the room for 25mins. Lasted an hour and a half. The doctor thought I might be having allergies...not till my 3rd time they found I was experiencing a panic attack. I had a panic attack one day and had a seizure afterwards. I don't remember anything but leaving the Er. But I remembered the panic attack and muscle spasms then I unconscious. Hit my head falling back. Lots of blood but it was small cuts so they didn't put in stitches. Bless all of you who have had a panic attack.
13276	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Idk if this is a panic attack or my blood pressure is low? I was standing doing my homework and I was all calm. Then I randomly felt sinking feeling, dizziness, and light headed and felt like I was gonna faint. Then I ran to the mirror and my lips were a little pale. My heart starting beating like crazy, I was crying, cheeks turned red, sweating and shaking everywhere. I’m planning on getting my blood test soon and don’t know if this is a panic attack or not. I do suffer from anxiety often but this was so scary feeling I never felt
13277	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had panic attacks and suffered from unrelenting anxiety for almost 2 years after I gave birth to my child. I have since completely recovered. I want to share the following tips: 1. Complete recovery is definitely possible; 2. Seek professional help asap (there is no shame to admit that you need help. Seeking help for emotional issues is no different from going to see a doctor when you suffer from physical ailments. No one feels ashame to see a doctor for a cold.) CBT helped me tremendously; 3. Many emotional issues have biological causes, such as hormone imbalance; 4. Take your time to seek out a therapist that is a good fit for you. Personally, I have consulted more than 5 professionals until I found the right one for me. 4. Never gives up! There is light at the end of the tunnel! Even though at times you may doubt it. I certainly did. But, have faith you will come out on top. 5. I am not afraid of, and I don't worry about a reoccurrence because I have learned the mechanism to deal with it if it ever pops up again. I hope these tips help. No matter what you do, do not suffer alone. There is help out there.
13278	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I dont think I've ever had a panic attack, but im going on a little road trip with my family tomorrow and im very anxious. A few months ago I had my first car accident and I could have died. I was in a tiny car and the other driver was going 45. Ever since then I get really upset when im in the car on the interstate. I have this weird feeling that ill just die tomorrow and no one will live to tell my friends im gone. Im terrified. Im just watching this video in case I do panic.
13279	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	when I get panic attacks my body stiffs and i fall down and i get the feeling of running away but i cant move... I had a terrible experience ever since i keep getting panic attacks time to time.... I tried to stop it by thinking positively and talking to my frinds about it asking for advice, but nothing helped after few years I eventually stopped getting nightmares and panic attacks... But last year my dad got a heart attack and it shocked me alot andi was so scared.... and after that happend the past bad memories and my panic attacks came back~ What should I do?? Go to a therapists???
13280	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i've been suffering panic attacks since late november 2021, they've never really stopped. although now, they've gotten less apparent. i was having them 1-3 times a day in school, kept getting sent home. now they aren't as bad, but they keep appearing. even when there's not really a trigger, but most of the times there are. my head goes crazy, my heart thumping, my thighs tensing and arms. i feel faint and my vision starts going a bit funny, then i hyperventilate til i'm out of the area either by myself or my friend. i usually cry though lol.
13281	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	To whoever is reading this and experiencing panic disorder right now, I’ve been there in a very bad and horrible place, but I assure you that you can 100% recover from it and the the following PTSD, and once you overcome it your life will never be the same. It’s worth it. Stay strong, and do aerobic exercises. For the record I fully recovered in about 2 years. You can do it even faster. ❤️
13282	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	how to differentiate panick attack from heart attack?
13283	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	It’s hard when your having a panic attack and people tell u to just relax and look annoyed .If only they knew what it actually feels like ,to all those who have gone through it Ik its not easy and can be a scary thing ❤️
13284	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"6 months and counting into my recurring battle with panic. Had another attack in the woods today while on a hike, just me and my dog out there. The ""tell tale signs"" of a heart attack can be found in panic as well, otherwise I'd be dead right now. An awful pain in the center of the chest, pressure that feels like a belt tightening around your chest, radiating pain into your back and shoulders, numbness and pain in your left arm, sweating, nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath, confusion, all of it I've experienced during panic attacks. Hopefully the light at the end of the tunnel comes soon. This does put very real stress on the heart to go through."
13285	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I told my bf that i have panic attack and anxiety. And he should be more patient and understanding with me but instead he blamed me for not doing anything for these attacks.
13286	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	anyone feel relieved after a panic attack? it's like before it happens, you can feel something is wrong, but you're not sure, like your heart is fluttering kinda. but then it happens. everything sucks. and then like... 10 or 30 minutes later, you feel relieved. like your heart is finally working normally, and you feel more relaxed. just me?? i dunno
13287	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	You know what's sad is that after reading so many comments here, I realized that most of us started having anxiety/panic attack when COVID-19 pandemic started. It's sad that we may not suffer with the virus but our mental health will definitely ruin us. But here we are almost 2 years of this pandemic and we're still fighting and trying to get through the day. We are not alone. We are here in this comment section for a reason. To tell each other that we're going through the same thing and we are strong to face these challenges everyday. I hope everyone gets better. Don't give up. Trust yourself! Everything is gonna be okay! This pandemic and our mental health is going to be part of our past one day!
13288	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	For me it felt like I wasn't getting any oxygen no matter how much I breathed. I was completely convinced I was suffocating to death and I was about to die. Once I realized it was strange I hadn't passed out, I realized that I HAD to have been receiving oxygen. Suddenly the feeling went away in minutes. Maybe this line of reasoning could help somebody else out too
13289	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Sometimes i wake up at the middle of the night panicking....it goes on from about 10 minutes to 1 hour depending on how bad it is....i get random panick attacks on a daily basis, but the worst ones are in the middle of the night Heart beats so loud and fast that i can hear it clear and feels like my heart is about to explode, literally..... another symptom is sweating Fuk, i hate it, bro😶 I cant seem to find an escape from it, but im trying
13290	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I wish it had a treatment :(
13291	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Not sure if it's the same, but once in a blue moon when something bad happens I'll get extremely lightheaded and shaky whilst my stomach feels like it's about to puke, it goes away within 10-20 minutes but I'm shaky the whole hour after. Most of the time I'm consciously aware nothing is wrong, but when it happens, it happens. Anyone know if this qualifies as a panic attack or not?
13292	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Panic attacks come to me usually when Im about to make a big change or face a big challenge in my Life, or again when I feel somehow caged. When I see no way out of a situation or i dont think i can handle It i feel like i cant breathe and i might cry and believe that there's only one way out: death. Its like a realisation: this Is the end. Its really hard in those moments to ask for help but ive learned to manage them alone.
13293	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Halloween day of 2015 they started. I've had countless since, differing in severity. Some hospitalized me. The scariest thing to me is how they mimic heart attacks. Like I never know if it's my anxiety, or I'm having a heart attack or something. They say to go to the hospital if you show signs of heart attack, but thats not an option for me, that would be a visit 4 or 5 times a week. It feels hard to get air, and your mind start freaking out and racing, and your chest feels funny, and it if its a really bad one you get hot flashes and your skin turns all clammy. Hangovers are pretty much guaranteed panic attacks, but being drunk is a guaranteed allotment of time where I CANT have an attack (maybe something due to it being a sedative). Its so horrible. I just want them to stop. I don't understand why my body does this too me. Is my mind broken or something? When they are bad enough, I just want them to kill me and make it be over.
13294	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"""Fear can't hurt you."" This. This I must believe."
13295	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	To all those watching this video for their mental health, in case no one tells you today, just know you’re not alone (a lot of us are here for the same reasons) and you’re doing an amazing job getting on top of your mental health. And you should be proud of yourself for doing so. I hope you have an amazing day, and know we’re all here with you :)
13296	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I just had a panic attack and it lasted for half an hour
13297	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	After the attack, my stomach was left like churning inside. It felt like I was having some kind of worry going on in my head. What one goes through a panic attack is scary, but the person remains unharmed at the end, to find out he/she went through all this for nothing. It's both a blessing and a curse at the same time.
13298	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’m asking for a family member. Do we go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist for panic attack treatment? What helps better?
13299	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I went through my first panic attack just last week and it felt like I was gonna die. I started getting shortness of breath, my heart was beating weird, my limbs went numb and shakey, and I was dizzy. Then after the panic attack I got sick with something for a week straight that made it hard to breath everytime I ate too much
13300	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've been having panic attacks(often) since 2019, so i know exactly how i prevent them and they are the worst
13301	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My panic attacks last for a couple hours every night
13302	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	It's really calming to know I'm not alone in this. I am 2 years panic attack free this August and now I often try to understand what made them stop. I used to have them so often, they were so scary, I hated having them in front of people because they kept talking to me but their voices were muffled so I couldn't understand what they were saying; my legs went numb, I was nauseous, heart went crazy, couldn't breathe... I remember one time I had a really big one which lasted for 4 hours and it happened on my birthday, kept thinking oh well, at least my grave stone will have the same dates lol. My last panic attack happened 1 day before I travelled to Austria with my mom to see her friends (I love mom, but she can be a bit chaotic!) I felt like the plane, the bus rides, the train - all needed me to be responsible, which made me have the first panic attack where I actually considered calling an ambulance. The whole journey I drew squares in my head, inhaled for 4 seconds, exhaled for 4 seconds, held my breath, listened to music so as not to hear the world around me. When we got there, I met my mom's friend, whose daughter had two small boys. They spoke German, I spoke English, so we couldn't really understand each other, but somehow that was okay. I remember drawing a hot air balloon for one of the boys and feeling a panic attack coming, then he came and said the German word for sun, which turned into laughter and us trying to mimic the sun. The feeling of unease went away. On the same day, we went down a path leading to a small body of water; the way down was quite steep, and a small kitten was following us. While everyone was happy, I was constantly anxious about the kitten falling off the hill, so I tried to guide her. The background faded, it was just me and this slippery kitten. At one point, I got angry, I didn't want to be responsible for her, so I just gave her to my mom telling her to look after her, that I can't deal with it. She said fiiiine, and then left her on a little bridge over the water, so the kitten almost fell. I rushed to get her, and I managed, which felt so odd. You know that feeling where you're pretty sure you can never save, only be saved? I knew this was a job I needed to do, nobody shared my sense of responsibility for this kitten, just like nobody seemed to share my uneasiness. And I guided her the whole way up again, where her owners said she always does this, going up and down that hill... I suppose I'm sharing this just to kindly say that it gets easier, somehow through things you don't expect. If mid-panic it doesn't feel like it, it will change. You will change! I think seeing innocence in the world, realising responsibility is needed but not meant to be perfect are good things to carry with you. That day, my panic attacks just stopped. I hope one day they stop for you too. I'm not sure if they'll come back, but if they do, I'll just draw squares in my head and mutter the German word for sun.
13303	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	No doctors listen to me when I talk about my panic attacks they just tell me to sleep early or breathe when I done that.
13304	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Just watching this video is almost giving me a panic attack :(
13305	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My legs are super tingly and my feet are having cold sweats i feel one building up take a deep breath
13306	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’ve never had a panic attack until like 4 or 5 months ago I was smoking then I went to get a haircut and it was in a house and where I was getting a haircut it was like a really tight place and then all of a sudden my heart starts pounding I’m sweating so much I legit had to get up drink water and it didn’t go until like 30 minutes and then after I felt very weird I didn’t feel the same like when ever I overthink my heart starts to beat really fast and just yesterday I had like a little panic attack and I couldn’t stop shivering which was really weird but I did have the fan on when I took it off I felt abit better but I also think smoking causes anxiety and I’m gonna try to stop smoking now
13307	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	The worst part of panic attacks is the physical apsect in my experience. Things like going numb, getting light headed, shaking uncontrollably. Some of the worst side effects.
13308	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	for anyone that sees this. it does get better. i haven’t had one in a long while now and i’m so glad❤️
13309	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Does anybody have cold hands and feet 24/7 and more than 3 panic attacks a day? Also accompanied with weight loss, loss of apetite, and neck stiffness?
13310	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My panic attack lasted in 15 minutes
13311	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I just had my first physically debilitating panic attack at 34 only 3 hours ago (2am). Something small triggered me at home. I went to pace, felt dizzy, and blacked out smashing my chin on the way down. I bit through my bottom gums making a hole while also smashing my eye socket. I also wet myself? Woke up in a cold sweat with the inability to think, focus, or control my body correctly .I Just got back from the er and youtube recommended me this video. That was an incredibly intense experience to say the least.
13312	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Can anyone give me suggestions on preventing, or what you do to slow the effects of a panic attack? I have them almost all day and it’s effecting me going out , and how I am at home. They didn’t start happening till a year ago and I’m desperate. I just don’t want to take anything in fear it will change how I think / react. I just want to be normal and feel good, I can’t even watch my kids alone in fear I’m gonna die and they will be left alone I hate it. I want to be normal again
13313	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"My solution to a panic attack may be unconventional. I have had several in my life and my cure is to accept and acknowledge that I am having a panic attack. I will tell myself ""Oh, this is a panic attack, just let it in and get it over with"". My panic attacks last a couple seconds this way with no aftermath. I hope this helps someone!"
13314	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have had lots of panic attacks. Two years ago had a panic attack for 36 hours. When I was not sleeping I was panicking. The scariest part is that I don't remember most of that time because I was so focused on trying to stay in control.
13315	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had panic attacks over a period of a couple months, with the fear of having a heart attack and dying. After the couple months passed I realized that nothing actually happened. After that realization they almost stopped happening. Had some creep up, but I quickly tell myself that I know nothing is going to happen the feeling just goes away. Sometimes a bit of rationalization helps a lot 😁
13316	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	2020, pandemic, losing my dearest grandma in front of my eyes, and then the panic attack just happened out of nowhere. For a while i thought i was going to die, but doctor said i was completely fine and healthy. Seeing everyone here have the same attacks as i am makes me feel like me and you are not alone and i know that i can go through it, and you too.
13317	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"im not sure but i think i experienced it once, and talking in front of the class was the cause. i felt so 'restless' and my head began to spin, i was shivering and my hands can't stop shaking. every heartbeat lead to more heavy breathing, i was stuttering and then suddenly my ears went ""ngingggg"" you know like the moment when all you can hear is something like a buzz??!!? then my vision was blurry for like 5 seconds. i can't remember what my professor said at that time, not at all. huh, was it really a panic attack or just me being over scared???"
13318	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	If I start having a panic attack, I call someone I feel comfortable with, and try just talking to them. This isn't perfect, but it keeps it from getting worse.
13319	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My panic attacks involve imagining and somewhat forcing comprehension of the vastness of the universe. I imagine increasing numbers that are crushing down upon me. Its like the power of infinity attacking me... The universe crushes down on my brain and its terrible :D
13320	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	thank you, been experiencing panic attacks for about 5 months now. I tried medication, but it still didn't work. I'm looking forward to cbt though, I really wanna try it so I could live normally and not fear about having a panic attacks every day.
13321	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	We’ll get better ❤️
13322	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Mine were caused from irrational fears of illness. I’ve been able to cure it from eating healthier and when I felt them coming on I’d just tell myself “it’s fine it’s just a panic attack”. I usually calm down and when I can’t, I call and talk to someone for a few minutes. Didn’t experience them until after I turned 30. It came at the same time that I started having acid reflux issues. Both now gone for the most part. Maybe I’ll experience a few minutes of it every couple of weeks but I’m fine and content. I hope for the best for everyone going through this.
13323	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've never had panic attacks buy my friend has had many and this video really helped me help him
13324	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	As someone who started having panic attacks really early on in life, they can change your perception of things and mess you up bad during such a important formative period. How young were you guys when it started for you?
13325	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Hate when im asleep, and it happens and i immediately get up and do what ever caused me to have an attack, like school work....it's stressful
13326	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	For a person like me, who tries to keep control of one's self a panic attack makes me feel like I can control nothing, I'm at the mercy of the universe. What a terrifying prospect.
13327	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Oh wow, my panic attacks are totally different from everyone. Mine come on so suddenly that I don’t know what hit me, especially the first time. It felt like a quick blow to the pit of my stomach and then a sudden rumbling, but no sound, a tremor, that feels like a volcano is about to erupt! The tremor begins to radiate quickly through my arms, legs, chest, & upwards . Next, my neck feels tense and hurts with tension yet causes my head to shake. Then my arms, legs, my whole body shakes (even my stomach) and I begin to perspire profusely while my hands feel cold & clammy . While this is going on, I feel as if I need to catch my breath. My heart is pounding like crazy, as if it were pounding through my chest and my breath becomes short & fast, like gasping that I can’t stand or sit anymore but need to just bolt! It’s the most horrible feeling!!! 😪
13328	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"I was diagnosed with panic disorder and generalized anxiety several years ago. I have experienced all of the symptoms here many times and I was hospitalized several times when I was younger due to reoccurring traumatic events related to love relationships. It reached it's peak in my 20's. The worst of it was developing a vaso-vagul disorder and tachycardia, which would cause me to pass-out everyday whenever I experienced depression or anxiety. It felt like I had discovered the bodies natural self-destruction mechanism. It became dangerous when I passed out and punctured my chin on the side of a desk, which required stiches. I'm glad it wasn't my head. I wasn't taking care of my body well (smoking and drinking to escape the pain), and thus the mind, spirit (nervous system) and soul (emotional memory in the body) suffered like a chain reaction. Medications didn't work well for me, and neither did overly controlled therapy, although I do advocate for some sort of therapy and have definitely benefited from it once I found the right therapist. Doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. All this changed when I stopped thinking someone else was going to save me, or that there was a miracle cure like a certain drug or escape route to make the pain and suffering go away. I took charge of my self through healthy diet and fitness, coupled with reading about different spiritual paths and philosophies which gave me discipline, without the shame of others directly telling me what to do with my life in the modern moment. I spent more time outside in nature away from society, social media, and the need to fit in all the time or be compressed by the judgements of others. I learned breathing techniques and yoga, which I practiced alone to find my own calm center without judgement of others. I managed all things addictive and gradually cut them out if they made me too overly attached to my pain and suffering. I found ""the warrior's path"" and fought my own demons head-on. Through all that work I can safely say that I am not perfect. I still suffer anxiety, depression, and the pain of life at times. I am a lot stronger though, and better able to coup and manage it through my knowledge and experience I have gained by staying in this world and greeting each new day with curiosity. I also know that life is full of pain and suffering for every living thing. It is part of the deal. Even the most privileged and comforted beings experience pain and suffering at some point or other. Being born is painful and so is dying. It is just the nature of life. It's not perfect, but it is beautiful and worth every breathe, when you are strong enough to detach in a healthy way from your own suffering and pain. Then maybe you'll have a chance to understand why you are here in this world."
13329	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i once had a panic attack so bad for me that i thought i was gonna die. it lasted 10 or 15 minutes and it was horrible. my body was numb and almost shaking, i was hyperventilating so bad i felt like i was gonna pass out. i had to go out in public after that and the fear of another attack was so strong. i just felt so heavy during it. i felt so weighed down by my thoughts, i felt so weak like i was a brittle twig? for anyone whos struggling with anxiety/panic attakcs, im here for you, its okay. everything will all be okay in the end. im giving a big hug to anyone struggling out there<33
13330	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	while watching this I got the breathless feeling again, and I started crying cos I just didn't wanna go through it again ;( Stay strong everyone!
13331	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have panic disorder and I just want to say I feel for everyone here who have experienced or still have panic attacks. I think the worst feeling is that subtle sign a panic attack is about to start. For me is when I get a numbing sensation in my head and about to have that feeling to pass out. That is when I feel most unsettling because once it starts you feel like your world is over. My body locks up, you can't move and it's scary af.
13332	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	As a person who suffered many years of panic attacks, in the end, the only cure is you. Trust yourself, forgive yourself, be kind to yourself, give yourself the time and space you need. You will get better, trust me.
13333	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my very first panic attack a little over a year now. I’ve always had friends with anxiety and some who even suffered from frequent panic attacks. I never truly understood it until I went through it. And it’s true, I can’t enjoy most of the things I used to before it happened. Even though I know it’ll pass and things will be okay, it’s difficult to control the physical feeling of it. Since then, I haven’t had another panic attack, but I’ve come close a few times. And if you’ve made it this far, just know you’re not alone. There’s an end to the nightmare, we just have to be strong and keep pushing even when we feel like we can’t anymore. 🤍
13334	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I experienced my first panic attack last April. It was scary. My upper body went numb and I was having chest constrictions. I really thought I was dying.
13335	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Yesterday I had my english board examination and I was well prepared and so confident...but suddenly I had panick attack and when I reached exam hall ...I was sweating and my hands were shaking so much .my heat beats were so hard and fast that I couldn't breathe...I wanted to die at that time ....my friends tried to calm me down ..I took deep breath but still I couldn't overcome that and whole exam I couldn't read a single word ...I feel really depressed that after preparing so well I losed having a panic attack 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
13336	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	During my panic attacks, my hands get very numb, and I am afraid I will lose the ability to move, and I get even more scared. Usually, speaking to my friend or girlfriend helps. I already explained them, they saw me during the panics, and they immediately respond when I am suffering this. I am lucky to have them.
13337	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’m so glad I found this video and this comment section. With my attacks I feel like I can’t breath and everything is closing in on my body so I am unable to move. My breathing gets raspy and that only seems to make it worse. My thoughts are jumbled and the only ideas that make it through the noise in my head is the need to quickly escape from where I standing. I hope anyone who goes through this similar thing can get the help they need like I have been fortunate enough to receive. I still struggle with constant anxiety to this day but to the people out there just know that you are never alone in your fight.
13338	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	As a child I suffered through panic attacks and I have never fully recovered. I learned a few tips if anyone wants to try them out though. 1. Think of all the good things in your life and realize that you are stressing over nothing 2. Assess the problem compared to what you are making if out to be 3. Distract yourself, the more you think the more you worry 4. If you can't fall asleep and don't want to take an anti depressant take melatonin, it's non addictive and will put you to sleep
13339	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	The only times I remembered having panic attacks was 1. during upper secondary school (years ago) in the morning when I couldn’t find something unimportant and I was gonna be tardy: went full on screaming and manic and it felt like I was terrified out of my wits and would cry if I didn’t find it (lasted less than 15 minutes) 2. A year after the pandemic a few minutes before a zoom call that I was doing in attempt to re-socialise after a year of seclusion: I was shaking, heart pounding painfully, air wasn’t going into my lungs and I almost backed out from the fear (disappeared only after the call actually began) 3. A few months ago when I was in the shower thinking (dreading) of a future of being stuck forever with my parents: I full on bawled and started choking trying not to sob and groan while crying (spent the longest time trying to calm myself down) Each time felt so different I’m not sure if they’re all really panic attacks or not but the thing they had in common was that I was fully rational in my head thinking why tf can’t I stop my body from reacting like this, and it terrified me that I couldn’t stop because I knew all the things I described were very trivial and shouldn’t have these erratic responses but somehow my body moved on it’s own. They’re also mostly far apart so I’m not even sure if I should seek help for them considering they’re very rare and I have no way to prove any of them since I always hid alone when I had them.

13343	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	panic attack feel like you have NO IDENTITY, that you stop knowing who you are because everything you learnt is an illusion and subject to doubt and destruction, you become overwhelmed within the realm of the unknown and you lose track of what is what, like in the middle of an ocean with an infinite depth with no solid reference below. I've experienced it a lot, i write about it accurately. mine were induced by marijuana and a recent PTSD. writing about it made me a different man, i understand myself more every day and it helped me process my past and come out as a more definitive being, it is a spiritual experience that made me closer to the universe and the concept of God. I wish all of those with panic attacks the best and remember, do not just dismiss it, it is an opportunity for you to understand, a gift, so take it and process it.
13344	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	hot water and my mother is one of the reason to calm me
13345	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	When I had my first panic attack, I was completely ready to die. Exams, no sleep, several caffeine pills deep which only made the cardiac symptoms even worse. After going through several more and learning what they are, I thought back to the time I had dismissed a friend's panic attack years ago and was absolutely shattered. If you haven't experienced one, it's very difficult to empathize.
13346	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"It's been almost 5 years since I live with panic and anxiety attack and this year I couldn't control them anymore. It became worse after I got my first Covid-19 vaccine, so I went to the Mental Health Clinic. I've been diagnosed with Panic Disorder which I'm not surprised. Talking to the doctor made me feel a bit calm and finally I found someone who can understand what I've been through and didn't call me lazy. I don't feel like doing anything almost everyday. I'm scared to go out there. My stomach always feeling full (I keep burping). I often feel uncomfortable to breathe. I didn't further my studies, I stopped working, I didn't hangout with my friends anymore because at this moment, I feel like I will cause them trouble if something happened to me. I feel like I don't know what to do anymore. I rescheduled my sleeping time, my meals time etc., but I still felt the same. Sick and tired. Everyday I tell myself ""Everything is gonna be okay. You will be healed one day. Just be patient."" 😞"
13347	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Was once plagued by these. There never seemed to be a trigger, just a feeling of suddenly falling off a cliff edge which came out of nowhere. Every time convinced I was dying. They all stopped as quickly as they started
13348	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	The worst thing for me is the none stop shaking in the hands and teeth chattering and the HEAVY HEAVY breathing and dizziness and you feel really heavy and you can’t stand cause you WILL fall to the ground.
13349	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm emetophobic, and its ruined everything for me, I have panic attacks everyday, looking at my food, making myself nauseous, stomach problems from not eating, starving myself, not eating late, I still have them to this day, god its horrible i get numb and get these little pokes of when your arm/leg falls asleep, i feel like i can't breathe, i feel light headed, i shake, sweat and cry. The best feeling in the world is whenever you start feeling better after a panic attack. No ones gonna read this, but thats okay <3
13350	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	The feeling of suffocation just holding you tight, choking you feels terrible. You can breathe but you feel like you can't get enough air, so you breathe faster and faster and the pain in your heart just making you panic more, it just can't be described how scary it feels having one.
13351	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	When I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack, I immediately focus on my breathing and try to divert my mind. I also pray. I have had 2 panic attacks and they have been really bad. I even told my husband that I was going to die that's how bad it was.
13352	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Do any of you guys experience sharp chest pains during panic attacks
13353	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Getting a panic attack for no reason is such scary experience. Sometimes I would sit down and play on my PC until I feel a sudden rush on my heart out of nowhere and began having intrusive thoughts of death, heart attack, etc. When I first have it, the attack lasted almost two hours and I began having anxiety about my body, eventually leading me to lose weight to avoid possible future panic attacks. Apparently, I still do, but only less frequent than before. Don't worry guys, panic attack is just the mind playing tricks to give you adrenaline without reason (unless there isn't one). As long as you're young and healthy, there's nothing to worry about. Edit: I know losing weight isn’t much of a solution to avoiding panic attacks, but as long as the heart is healthy enough to know that getting a panic attack is just a temporary occurrence and will not damage your heart. Panic attack is just triggered haywire mentality
13354	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	One time I had a panic attack while driving. My one hand went completely numb that I couldn’t even grip the steering wheel, I was so scared. You are not alone, we all got this.
13355	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I used to think people who had Anxiety/ Panic Attacks were just being over dramatic… This was until last week where I had one myself. The feeling of my heart racing and the tight chested difficult I had to breathe was terrifying. It was an awful experience, although I now have sympathy for anyone who goes through this! Just remember you’ll be fine and it won’t last forever ❤️
13356	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	When I was having a panic attack I couldn't breathe properly :(( my feet and hands are numb and I feel like I'm about to pass out. Can't even swallow properly and can't yawn or burp properly. It's really hard I really need help :(( I'm going to have an appointment on Nov 18 wish I'll be okay. 🙁
13357	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	fellow child here: i'm currently having a minor panic attack since my mother is the only parent plus the dearest. shes not home right now and her phone is off the logical explanation is her phone died but the longer i think about it the faster new things come up to the point i called the police such as -her phone probably died -what if she got into a car crash? -what if someone kidnapped her? -what if in general she died/killed? currently ill be waiting untill 11pm the latest time she last got home from work - god please make sure she's okay

13360	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	it has taken over my life now. I can't go out because I'm afraid I'll experience it again it's so hard and nobody understands the severity of what I'm feeling right now. I wish I can live a normal life without it.
13361	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"My mom was abusive physically and verbally when I was young and I used to get panic attacks all the time. I still do sometimes. It usually starts with either thinking too much about death, or if I feel like I can't breathe, I'll start to hyperventilate and it'll make my Panic attack worse which makes the hyperventilating worse. I'm afraid of dying. And what happens after you die. I'm a Christian and I believe in heaven, but still the thought lingers in the back of my mind ""what if it's just nothing after you die?"" I'm not afraid of that per SE, I'm just afraid of how short life is and how I haven't been able to do anything I want and I don't want to die having wasted my life. I hate panic attacks."
13362	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have always been a person who stresses a lot about everything, but I always ignore this feeling by laughing or anything that can make me escape all my bad feelings. I have been depressed many times, but it only lasts for one week and then things get better. After high school, I got a scholarship to the U.S and I was so excited, but as always I am stressing a lot. I came to the U.S and I finish a whole semester and was able to control my anxiety, depression and stress. In the summer I started to feel that one day I will lose control over my anxiety, stress, and depression because I have always known that these emotions will never stay in my head forever, then I ignored that. Three months later I started to feel that there is pain in my muscles, heart, chest, head, and many other things, but at that time I didn't know it is about my mental health. I went to many doctors, and I always get this phrase from my doctors “ there is nothing wrong”. One time I left the hospital crying because there is no explanation for every pain I have felt, and I went through the hardest depression in my life, it was a disaster and such a nightmare, I stayed a whole week in my room ( I live alone ) and I didn't even text anyone, and I kept ignoring every phone call. I didn't have the energy to do anything and I didn't even attend the midterms week. I felt that i will lose my mind and i will never be the same, I couldn't even sleep. The second day I had three panic attacks, I went to the emergency, and I felt that this will be my last day in my life. while I was in the hospital I booked a ticket to go back home and I withdraw my scholarship. My depression really controlled me to change all my dreams. I am getting now, but the only thing I regret is that I kept many things in my heart when I could express them. The most interesting thing is that right now I really knew my purpose in life. I will quit engineering, and I want to be a psychologist to help people live their best life. Sorry if my English is bad. Stay strong hero ❤️❤️
13363	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've always had social anxiety, probably due to bullying, but I had a panic attack at a job interview 10 months ago...and I haven't been able to apply for another since. Even starting applications brings the onset of a panic attack. I've tried CBT and SNRI's, but neither have helped. This is so paralyzing. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I just want to work!!!
13364	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	New to panic attack experiences here. Has anyone felt accompanying jabbing-like chest pains that are excruciating along with the impending doom and anxiety?? 🤔
13365	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’ll never forget being rushed to the hospital at 2am, convinced it was a heart attack, only to find out I was perfectly fine. I didn’t realize it was a panic attack until years later
13366	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	is there anything i can do to calm down? everytime i try deep breathing it just gets worse and i feel like im going to pass out. also its friday today, im scared.
13367	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	This just taught me that I have actually never had a real panic attack before. All were anxiety attacks which are not as bad but bad enough
13368	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Please.. help me i can't take it anymore..i want to live my life being free..
13369	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Im currently learning about panic attacks to help my friend who has PTSD, anxiety and turret syndrome ^^ in trying my best to help him, his family isn't really supportive so I'm trying to be there for him. Thank you for sharing that knowledge
13370	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Strangely enough, I feel incredibly relived after a panic attack. I've been suffering from them for years due to OCD, and I know there's always a next. So when it's over, I don't dread the next as much. The worst part is over, it's okay. Yes there'll be a next, but that's okay. You'll be okay afterwards. It doesn't work for everyone I know, but it helps me.
13371	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	For me, they happen randomly. When they come on, I feel completely detached from reality (this is the scary part) but at the same time aware of everything around me. I have no control (this is also the scary part) when it's happening though, or if I do, it's as if I'm moving through a thick fog (both mentally and physically). This is all under the surface. I don't hyperventilate or do anything with my body physically, so no one knows that I'm having one when it hits. Anyone else have the same thing?
13372	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	As someone who suffers several panic attacks it’s reassuring to know what i can do, and seeing the comments who go through the same things, it feels like im not alone

13374	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	this happens to me every once in a while when i’m with a lot of people
13375	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	So good to know i am not alone. Thanks to everyone for sharing your stories. I suffer too and sometimes feels like i can never live a normal life. I stopped doing everything i used to do, couldnt go out even for a supermarket. I am doing a little better now but still have a long way to go. The thing that worked for me was learning not to fight the panic. Instead i accepted it and took a step back and let it wash over me. I managed to prevent an attack like this one time. Its different for everyone but maybe this helps someone. I love you guys and i hope everyone gets better. The fear cant hurt you.
13376	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my first panic attack today. I literally thought I was dying. I’m 5 months pregnant and I thought I was having a heart attack. I literally called 911 and they sent the paramedics over. They said I was okay and I’m glad I was wrong. I never knew what a panic attack felt like until the paramedic asked me if I’ve ever had one before and that it might be that. He said to follow up with a doctor/obgyn to make sure but that I should be okay. I wish I saw this video beforehand so that I didn’t waste the resources of emergency responders.
13377	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"I am absolutely astonished. I literally had my first panic attack a few days ago and, being someone who's been through 4 open-heart surgeries, I thought it might have been the end. It really messed me up, and I haven't been able to think straight unless I distracted myself with mindless tasks like television and smoking. Then today I decided to take work off to have a ""Mental Health Day"" and really work on figuring out what happened and try to put a stop to it in the future, and I just so happened to stumble upon this video. I'm not saying miracles happen or anything, but damn does it feel like something out there is here for us sometimes...."
13378	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	The worst part for me is the sinking, dizzy feeling that makes me feel like im about to pass out and lose control over my body. It's horrible.
13379	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've been having panic attacks for months because my parents argue all the time. They seem to argue everyday and I'm in constant fear of it. I enjoy going to school just to get time away from my parents. I had had panic attacks before but they made them worse. I keep having attacks more often and they keep getting worse and worse. I feel so hopeless and think that I may die of stress if something doesn't happen soon. I just want to leave. I stay in my room on my phone all the time to escape the real world because I can't handle it. I'm shaking right now because it's happened again. I usually pray to God and he makes it better, but I can't help but feel the inevitable dread of my parents arguing more. I now live in constant of them arguing, although they say it's not that bad. I have no one to talk to except my siblings and friends. I've tried to speak to them but they get really annoyed at me. Thank you for reading this. God bless you all x

13382	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Good god I am so glad I only had one panic attack ever because I accidentally overdosed on my meds, I usually just get horrible anxiety, it feels like right before a panic attack, numbness, fast breathing etc. but it never escalates. My heart goes out to all the people who get panic attacks regularly because I honestly don't know how I'd deal with something like that, yall are strong af <3
13383	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"I don’t really know if my problem is a panic attack, since I do not get problems with my breath.. But when I get in that state where I’m normal to being afraid of anything and everyone around me, I am calm, but on the inside in my head I am sure that I am going to die now.. And nothing really help, I even get scared of my own family.. My first time expiriencing this was when I was doing LSD with some ""friends"", whom got me scared of them and in my head they could read my thoughts.. after that, whenever I take a hit from a joint or taking psycedelics, my ""panic attack"" comes in play.. but it happens sometimes (only in night time) when I don’t do drugs either.. pls someone help me"

13385	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My favorite part of panic attacks is when you're literally just chilling, no noise, no stimulation and BAM! Comes out of nowhere.

And whenever I see her or see that she's sent me a message my chest hurts and I get really stressed out and don't know what to do, so I usually just freeze up and stress out and my heart starts racing and I start sweating.

Now it's almost 2022, and my anxiety is gone! Of course, I might get a little more nervous about something than other people will, but I'm still young, so there was enough time to do something about it. I had a total of only two panic attacks during that time, and both times I was extremely scared of dying. I thought I was going to die and those thoughts wouldn't leave my mind. So I started to take care of myself. Every time I looked in the mirror I'd think nice things about myself and what I saw in the reflection. I remember when the attacks happened, I'd always think ""This too, shall pass"" and start to feel a little better. I think both times my attacks happened it was because of a lack of sleep. The first time it happened I had no idea what was going on so I locked myself in the bathroom and texted my friend about what was happening, and he comforted me through it. The second time it was a smaller attack and wasn't as scary because I knew what to do and knew what was going on this time, but either way it's still a fright. My attacks didn't last the whole day, only for a few minutes or a little longer, but I would still be a bit shaken up for the rest of the day. You all are so strong, and I believe in you. I made it, so I have no doubt that you all will too. I'm forever grateful to everyone who helped me with my anxiety, so I want to help people with theirs in return. I'm the mom/therapist friend, so if any of you ever want to talk, I'm here💜Stay strong!"
13399	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had a severe panic attack in June. It’s September now and everyday I’m still working through the psychological trauma. For the first two weeks afterwards I couldn’t leave my house, and just being awake felt overwhelming and miserable. Anxiety attacks, depersonalization, disassociation, it’s been months of wading through what feels like psychological warfare, but I’m finally getting to a place where my life is starting to feel like my life again. It’s nice to know others have gone through this. So if you’re out there thinking you’re going crazy, or you’re depressed because it feels like you’re life will be miserable and never the same - I’m here for you, and happy to talk anytime.
13400	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Can anyone that has anxiety/panic attacks describe to me how they found out it was just that? I’ve been going to doctors left and right getting blood work x rays cardiologists and still no conclusion.. I feel like I’m going crazy!! Am I going to have a heart attack one day or am I suffering from attacks
13401	174	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Knowing that we all going through this makes me feel I’m not crazy after all .I couldn’t explain to people how I felt especially to my Hispanic parents so reading all this makes me feel I’m going to be okay and I hope you all do to and we can hopefully find some type of happy and calm .
13402	175	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	when I have a panic attack: my best friend: *tries to calm me down* my fake friend: lol our school nurse: *gives ice pack* my mom: it’s cause you’re playing too much video games
13403	176	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	First time I experienced it, i couldn't feel my face, i was hyper-ventilating, my heart was beating too fast and i felt like fainting. My hands were shaking for almost half an hour. It was so intense. I hope never to experience that again. :(
13404	177	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"I've been in therapy for months now. Panic attack, ptsd, ocd, ADHD, anxiety, depression, you name it. I finally realised something. These aren't my diseases. These are my body's coping mechanisms. The last time was in the verge of my panic attack. I told my racing heart ""I realise you are fighting to keep me out of danger, thanks for protecting me alll these years. Iam safe now."" IT WORKED. I am no expert. But it this helps someone, even one person, I would be really happy."
13405	178	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Honestly, I sometimes feel like my panic attacks are holding me back despite the way I push through them. I get anxious about having to go to work and be on my own the entire time I'm there because of a recent shift in the way staff works. Meaning - I'm working 12.5 hrs at a time completely on my own. I also have bad claustrophobia, so on top of having to use underground subways to get to work, I'm also wearing a mask which amplifies the feeling of being trapped and triggers my panic further. I've been trying to do mindfulness when in these situations, especially because I work in a high stress environment. I'm starting to think it's time to change what part of my field I work in, because I can't handle having the panic attacks so often that it's debilitating. ☹️ I love what I do, but I can't help but feel humiliated when I'm working in a sector with youth struggling with their own mental health and come into work struggling to get my own under wraps
13406	179	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Im literally just chilling and just randomly i get a panic attack that ruins my whole day. And its also really hard to sleep at night with that feeling. Its nice to know im not the only one and im not alone :)

13419	192	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my first panic attack almost 2/3 weeks ago now. I had woken up from a sort of a bad dream that circulated around the situation i was going through. It was the worst feeling ever. The second one happened that following week. And even though both of them didn’t last that long, i felt an extreme type of anxiety within me, and it felt like nothing is real the entire day. I haven’t told anyone in my house about this yet neither do i think i will ever have the courage to tell them about it. Idk how i pulled myself out from both of them all i know is i just did. Somehow.
13420	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had a panic attack during dance class today. I’m scared I’m gonna have one at school because I couldn’t stop crying one it starts. I don’t have anxiety but I absolutely HATE it. It’s terrible. I wish no one has to deal with them.
13421	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	How I cured severe anxiety and panic attacks: Started running few times a week Read Self Help Books. cold showers and deep breathing 5 times a week. Do progressive muscle relaxation - at least 3 times a week. Try to figure out which situations make you anxious and slowly expose yourself to them - it won't be that difficult if you have been doing things listed above. Ditch caffeine Spend more time in nature and with friends. Supplements - Vit B complex, omega 3s, Vit d3 Also remember that panic attacks cannot harm you. Read about it, because knowing and understanding it will result in you being less anxious and panic attacks simply won't occur as often. Please upvote, it's gonna save lives.
13422	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My biggest fear is having a panic attack when I'm at job ,or somewhere with people (restaurant, gathering at a house) and I can't find an excuse to leave. How you people deal with panic attacks when out with other people?

13430	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've been to the ER twice within a week, certain that i was dying. Turns out il completely healthy but the chest tightness and the fear of having a heart attack doesn't fade. Never had a panic attack before last week and now I've had three. The one I had yesterday was terrible, it built up with chest pain for hours untill it finally peaked for about 15 minutes. Truly a horrible experience
13431	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Right now..I lost my best friend....and having panic attack but no one is there to help me😭😭

13434	207	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	A friend of mine had one last week. After the panic attack i suggested her to find some treatment, like a psychologist. She said she didn't want to, it was normal and she was ok (i don't think so, she almost passed out because of a mathematic question). So I told her that seeing her that way hurt me and i was very worried. I think she gave it a second thought, because in less than a week she went to see a psychologist. situations like that happens a lot with some of my friends and I always try to help them with my best, it's probably the main reason that makes me wanna be a psychologist myself.
13435	208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	You just can't control them
13436	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Had a panic attack earlier, -999/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND

13438	211	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Mines been everyday and it gets worse when I try to sleep
13439	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	During my 1st (and worst) panic attack I felt like I was about to die. I felt like I couldn't breathe, I wasn't able to walk and I was shivering VERY ENERGETICALLY. It lasted about 30 minutes and it started for no reason. Has anyone else had one similar to mine?
13440	213	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i experienced my first panic attack a few months ago. i literally thought i was about to die. i quickly took into account my surroundings and told myself that everything was ok. i’m healthy and happy. i was able to calm myself and afterwards i realized what had happen. now whenever i get that feeling i reassure myself that everything is okay and the panic attack stops.
13441	214	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Been battling this for 6 years, started when my was pregnant with our first child, at the time I didn’t know what it was, I was at work..thought it was a heart attack or stroke. Co workers called EMT and I was taken to the hospital, ever since that day I’ve been battling panic attacks.
13442	215	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Panic attacks is like a monster that takes away your inner peace and stands In front of you covering your path. the only way out of it is confronting it

13444	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I seriously need help. Quality of my life is rock bottom 😭😭i panic because of fear of panic attacks
13445	218	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	If I feel lonely and if I’m sad and cry almost a week is that a panic attack
13446	219	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have been having them more often they had stopped for awhile . Had a couple today and now just am in fear of it constantly . I am praying for you all because I know what you're going through and its rough !
13447	220	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have panic attacks from arguing with ppl cuz I never had a chance to speak for myself especially when it's not my fault but I have just realised
13448	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Its always occur in me
13449	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	This is almost 95% accurate depiction of what happens to my body during anxiety. I had my 1st panic attack almost 4 months ago at the age of 36. Since then I have been feeling anxious about it not repeating again. I was trying not to read about it on internet because there's lots of misinformation about health topics by amateurs on the internet. Today I gathered some courage and this is the 1st one I watched because TED-ED seems like a responsible channel. I must say animations were little overwhelming for me but they were accurate. Also I'd like to mention that the comment section is very reassuring to me that I am not the only one to go through this. Most of the comments are respectful and helpful. Only those who go through this can understand this feeling of anxiety. Wish you all full recovery or at least wish we all can contain it to minimum levels. Good Luck.
13450	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My panic attacks lasts sometimes all day and the while night it starts by negative thoughts then it's hard Heart beating I Can't stand more ; I feel I am over I can't even tell Anyone
13451	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Two days ago, I saved my online friend from having a panic attack. I learned that she has anxiety and that she always texts her mom before bed to feel safe. If there’s no response, that’s when she panics. Lasted for about two hours but I gave her comfort and then her mum finally responded. She felt calmer and thanked me
13452	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I am facing it from one year
13453	226	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I recently had a panic attack but it's an everyday thing for me is that normal? I'm new to this and it legitimately feels like I'm either going to have a heart attack or I have a chemical imbalance in my brain. I constantly have a headache I get lightheaded but that's it. I'm constantly worried about having another one I've quit smoking weed and drinking and am about to quit cigarettes too. I've ordered a blood pressure cuff because my upper body feels hot all the time i have maybe a few hours where i dont feel this way otherwise its constant. I've woken up out of sleep heart racing sweating bad wobbly legs and ended up going to the er several times over this i just want to know what's wrong even though everyone tells me I'm having a panic attack. I really feel like something's happening to me can anyone please verify because i dont go outside much anymore because I'm afraid something's going to happen outside of my house. It's like I'm trapped inside and i don't know what to do. I just got woken up to my heart racing and really hot in the face and a headache all at once please help?
13454	227	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Does everybody also feel like sitting too long can make you feeling panicky and your heart starts beating fast?
13455	228	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I describe a Panic attacks as “you’re watching a car about to crash and you see it about to hit but it never does and you caught in a repeat of that moment over and over”
13456	229	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I love these comments. Now, I know I'm definitely not alone.
13457	230	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i use to have such bad panic attacks… where to the point… i would break down and start crying… until i couldn’t breathe… i started getting panic attacks at the age of 13 years old… as well i had other disabilities. it took me until i was 19 years old to over come these panic attacks. it’s made me a stronger person, and it’s made me become the person i am today. to this very day i love to help others in this concept.
13458	231	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my first panic attack yesterday, I was at my grandma and I always have sleepovers at my grandma's house without my mom, But as I was falling asleep I thought about my mom since my aunts and little cousins were here too and tears started flowing out, I stopped breathing/ hard to breath and the worst part was that I had to stay quiet and I had thoughts that something happened to my mom or something. it went for around 15 minutes before I ran to the bathroom and it continued in there, but thankfully nobody found out, it was a terrible experience I hope nobody else goes through it.
13459	232	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	If you have panic attacks...its because your brain is broken.....you should fix it,or live miserably with a broken brain.... I've never had a panic attack,why?...... because I dont let people, circumstances, situations affect me so much that it causes my thinking to hurt me......
13460	233	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Wow this comment made me feel like I wasn’t crazy for the first time. Had a major trigger 4 months ago and ever since I have been feeling like this every hour of every day. Some days I feel like I will never get better, but this comment made me feel a bit better :) Thank you
13461	234	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Can I have help please? I have random panic attacks for no reason in the middle of the night

13463	236	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I can’t describe my anxiety attacks or anxiety at all I went to the hospital to the doctor and couldn’t explain anything

13465	238	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	watching this while having panic attack. it's been hours i'm so terrified.
13466	239	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I started having Panic attacks when I was 14yrs old, I’m now 33yrs old. From the age of 19-32 was great I learnt how to over come them well at least I thought I did. For the past 6 months it’s been really bad for me, for instance I had one the other night and it was so bad I had to get my wife to drive me around until I finally passed out 😵 funny but not funny!!! Now my anxiety levels are even higher with the aftermath of them which has lasted me 2 days & Sadly I feel like my brain is messed up again and I can’t find the state of mind that I would put myself in not to have them. Here lately my anxiety levels have been flaring up when me and my wife are on the way home from a night out or a weekend away. I know in my mind my anxiety is getting high because of the fear of having another episode when I get home. Not cool at all!!!!
13467	240	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I cried during this video lol. Whenever people talk about panic attacks, it makes me super emotional because I have 2-8 a day and they last anywhere from 5 min to multiple hours. I’m tired of feeling hopeless and helpless.
13468	241	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Caution: Don't readout the comments, it will definitely give you panic attack or anxiety....
13469	242	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	here's a few things you can try Don't take stimulants including alcohol and coffee Try to relax Exercise often Seek help from others (I read these and more ideas on Trevs panic fixer website )
13470	243	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	The worst is once you’re used to them a lil and you tell yourself everything is ok but then you mind goes “what if this is an actual heart attack and not just a panic attack?” 😥
13471	244	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	ive just started a new job and get panic attacks something will happen while im at work, as well as getting panic of what im going to have to do there. Anybody else?
13472	245	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Before i was diagnosed with anxiety i thought i was gonna have a heart attack because my heart was beating so fast and i couldn’t breathe well so i had to be rushed on an emergency room and they did tests on me and they said it was just a panic attack so they told me to calm down and take a rest for a while the doctors let me stay for 3 days in the hospital for observation (Sorry for my very bad grammar im still working on my english)
13473	246	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I don’t have thoughts when I have a panic attack… Just extreme depersonalization and this weird floating feeling. I feel like I don’t even have a body
13474	247	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Does anyone feel kinda tired too, when they have panic attack?
13475	248	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I can describe panic attacks. It's like butterflies in my stomach and I'm short in breathe for hours. So I stay inside my room and fold clothes or just lay down and hope that I will fall asleep.
13476	249	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Feels home to be among the Panic and anxiety attack cult
13477	250	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I always feel like my panic attacks are set off by things/events that have made me have one before such as a commercial or show on tv or a smell. Anyone else?
13478	251	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have had panic attacks since 2019, my chest and stomach tightens and my heart races, my hands turn numb and I start to tremble, I feel trapped, and completely stuck. Even when I try to calm down I still feel I can’t escape. Everything and everyone become nothing to me, just a blur. my mind is entirely in this new vague and dark world
13479	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	One time I was having such a bad panic attack, it felt as if my hands and feet were balloons. And everything I touched felt like I was both going to crush it, and it would pop my own limbs.
13480	253	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I was having anxiety attacks then I tried cbd oil, it does miracles! I only had a few panic attacks in my sleep, I woke up to them every time. It was like I couldn't breathe and I had that dreadful feeling that something awful will happen. I've been using some strong cbd oil for a year now and they stopped. Don't go to see doctors or spend your money on prescription drugs, buy some cbd oil!!
13481	254	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I appreciated this video…I also have things to add. My panic attacks were reduced partly through therapy and medication. However, if you really want to keep them at bay in a lasting way, then do a course in EEG neurofeedback through your therapist’s office. Neurofeedback retrained my brain without pain or side effects. I rarely have panic attacks now. The other key? Significantly cut down sugar and caffeine intake. Diet is key, because your gut and brain are continually talking with one another. Medications are great for putting out the fire of a panic attack. That’s not as handy as stopping them from occurring for a long, long time. I carry my medication the way I carry car insurance paperwork in my car. I don’t expect to use it all the time. I just need it if I’m in a wreck. Lastly, in the moment a panic attack is happening, trust your breathing to get you through it. When you feel the panic creeping up, focus on SLOW, abdominal breathing, for several minutes. Really feel your belly pushing out. That deep, slow breathing will restore proper airflow to your brain. That will calm the body. You’ll probably yawn—a great sign. What’s often occurring in a panic attack is that we are holding our breath. After awhile, that feeling of creeping panic became a cue that I’m not breathing slowly and deeply. A little while after that, the feeling in my brain didn’t scare me so much because I knew how to beat it. Also, do yoga, take walks, and eat your greens.

13483	256	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have been struggling with panic attacks for about 2 years now sometimes I can go for several days without one and then sometimes I have them for several days in a row ... I feel as if I am having a heart attack or going to pass out when I am experiencing them and they can come out of nowhere as well ... any tips from anyone on what I can do to get my life back?
13484	257	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’m a 16 year old…….was in my math exam and it wasn’t going well. There were only 10 min and questions worth 20 marks were left. I thought I was just nervous as I’ve always been an overachiever but that’s when it happened. My hands started shaking like crazy. I just couldn’t control them and focus on writing. I was feeling extremely cold and had tears in my eyes. It wasn’t the first time this was happening to me but it was one of the worst ones. I don’t know if it was a panic attack or just anxiety but that experience is just horrible.
13485	258	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have just experienced my first major panic attack in the middle of the night recently on august 3rd at around 1 am and trust me, it is not pleasant when you are uncontrollably shaking and scared.
13486	259	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Hi everyone. I never had panic attacks until my mid 20's then BOOM, there they were. I've been fighting them off for over 10 years and it is (very unfortunately) the defining struggle of my life. Panic has stood in the way of jobs, of my physical health, of my progression as a healthy person. Reading all the comments reminds me how common this is and that, though I'll likely have panic attacks forever, they don't have to keep me from living my life anymore. Thanks.
13487	260	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have 5-6 very intense panic attacks a year. I discovered biting into a lemon/lime will immediately shock my nervous system and I start to regain consciousness.
13488	261	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I am not an expert. What real cause panic attack? That's the hardest part! It would be some exp years ago that link to it. Exercise Surround yourself with good companies Hobby Meditation Good diet Good mental hygiene Good rest
13489	262	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	When you have a panic attack, I feel like the best way to calm it is to have someone who hugs you strongly in his arms until it’s gone. You desperately need the reassurance that everything is alright and that there’s nothing to be scared of.
13490	263	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	We're in this together guys. We will go through it together. We have to keep in mind that We're human and these ups and downs that we go through is only temporary and there are ways we can learn to manage such emotions and be more in the present. Much love to each and everyone of you. You are not alone ❤️
13491	264	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Just reading the word panic attack made me feel anxious already, then watching this video made me feel more anxious. I think it would be better if the video was calming and gentle.
13492	265	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	3 years ago I was going through anxiety disorder, for an entire year I was massively suffering on a daily basis and I even thought about ending this altogether. But fortunately I identified my problem and got treatment. Even now I feel happy that I don't have it anymore. I just want to say to all of you who are suffering, just hang in there, get treatment and try to interact with friends and family every day, happy conversation happy moments will help you physiologically and treatment will help you massively as well.
13493	266	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	CBT….I can’ttttt 😂😂😂😂
13494	267	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	The worst feeling to me is the beat of my heart going so hard and fast. It’s like your suffering a heart attack… and that generates you a constantly obssesion with the beat of your heart at every moment…
13495	268	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	This kind of experience is so overwhelming! I feel like I’m losing myself, and I don’t know what to do. I always fear that my heart would stop working and I get into an anxious position where I think about it all the time and it’s so annoying! Just about a few months ago everything was ok and I felt very good! But now all of that happen and I can’t even understand what exactly can I actually do..
13496	269	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Drink lots of water, don't forget. LOTS. it helps. Also, alot of greeny leafy vegetables. No caffiene. Talking to Christ helps as well, but I know some don't believe He is alive.
13497	270	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	The last time I've had a panic attack was roughly 2 months ago (somewhere around the start of May) and ever since then I've been feeling really brain dead. Can't think, can't remember things that just happened, have delayed reaction times, can't speak clearly, can't come up with words to describe something, have had a headache that just won't leave me alone (it feels more like pressure though, doesn't exactly hurt) Is this normal? Talked to my mom about it, says its just stress but idk anymore :/ I'm just hoping I didn't get any brain damage.
13498	271	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"I'll have these random moments where I feel somewhat off for no reason so I check my heart rate and suddenly my heart rate picks up and I feel my breathing quicken. A feeling of dread/panic blooms in my chest which sometimes makes me feel dizzy or stuck inside my head. It's like I can only focus on the dread making it hard to focus on anything or anyone actually around me. On worse occasions I start trembling and feel nauseous. As a hypochondriac I used to think that I have something physically wrong with me, and I still sometimes think that, but more recently I've started to figure that it's probably just anxiety attacks. I'm 14 years old and I'm kinda conflicted on whether or not I should ask my parents to get me properly diagnosed with anxiety so I can get help before it progresses. Thoughts? ""^^"
13499	272	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Right now i m having a panic attack and also I'm able to smile through it. Have a great day guys Thank god its over. Feeling more confident to face the next one. 😊
13500	273	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"Is it still a panic attack if I don't get the heart symptoms? What happens is my stomach starts hurting and I feel lightheaded like I'm going to pass out, severe sense impending doom, inability to focus on anything, feels like I just forget to breathe. Does anybody else not get the heart racing/hyperventilating symptoms? Is this just extreme ""regular"" anxiety?"
13501	274	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've had anxiety disorders for half my life and has only gotten worse. Taken over my life. Hard to get a job, hard to drive and recently last week I was in waiting room at doctors and had the biggest attack I had In years outta nowhere. I was already a little nausea on my way there and I have this thing where if I'm nauseated in a public place around people I panic and the attacks begin which of course makes my stomach worse. Of course in the waiting room with a mask on made it worse. I couldn't breathe. Had to go outside which only lasted 2 minutes before I was called in. Sweating, shaking, can't breathe and nauseated. I at one point in the room waiting for doc I almost RAN out cuz the panic hit so bad. Thought I was dying. After I was done, my anxiety started to calm down. When I got home, I was SUPER drained/tired the rest of the day and also got very hungry from all the calories I burned from the high heart rate. Everyday since then, anytime I think of that day I start feeling anxiety agian and quickly distract myself. I fear of it happening agian when I go back.
13502	275	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I absolutely hate having panic attacks!!! Nobody will ever fully understand one unless they experienced a panic attack😞
13503	276	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"I have emetophobia, a fear of nausea and vomiting. Any time I get any digestive unrest or small pang of nausea (from heat, illness, food, ect.) I start panicking. The fear of getting panic causes me to panic. Panicking also makes me nauseous. There is no winning. I've been on slews of different meds, seen therapists and psychiatrists. Some meds help with the ""intensity"" of some of the symptoms but don't stop them from happening. Panic hits when I'm sleeping and I'll wake up with my heart racing. At its worst, with panic attacks rolling into each other, I've had to go to the hospital for help. It literally feels so terrible I get close to suicide just to get away from the feeling. An extended feeling of death and dying. I don't have much hope."
13504	277	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Mine started about 3 weeks ago…it happened once and I fainted multiple times I thought that I was going to die, I forgot about this for a week and this week when I was on the underground/subway I felt the feeling of fainting which was really scary because I felt like I was by my self dying. Ever since, I almost have one every day. What my family does not understand that I feel soooooo tired as my attacks last for hours and physically I feel drained. I am always scared to be by myself, I don’t want to be alone when it happens but i feel bad because I’m putting pressure on my family… they are staying of from work or they not getting enough sleep. I just wish to get better but the appointments are far away and it’s really hard to get therapy as it’s on demand because of COVID I just feel trapped.
13505	278	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Suffering from panic attacks, quick heartbeat, discomfort & loss of sleep. All this really hurts, to top that off; I have 2 final exams left and my body won't stop with the fear. I will leave this comment here in case I find it years later thinking what I had in mind. This really hurts :(
13506	279	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Hey has anyone ever experienced severe pressure on the back and the top of the head during a panic attack
13507	280	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Panic attacks are genuinely the worst things I've experienced. It's mental torture.
13508	281	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	What are things I can do for my friend if she has a panic attack? Are there like comforting sentences or exercises that I can help with? How can I help?
13509	282	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my first panic attack and it was such a scary experience. I couldn’t control my body my hands were cramped and i felt like i would die any second… i am sympathetic towards anyone who experience such attacks :(
13510	283	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	If anyone feel this way can we do a group in messenger
13511	284	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm honestly trying to figure out if I'm even having panic attacks or not. As someone who is a hypochondriac, it's terrifying to not know for sure. I think the most common symptom for me is lightheadedness, my head and at some points my whole body feels weirdly light and kind of numb (?). My heart beats fast sometimes too and I feel, in the best way I could describe it, as if I'm not real or as if everything around me isn't real. But, that happens sometimes whether I'm having all those other symptoms or not. Then, I can't think of anything else but the symptoms so distracting myself is hard. I start thinking over and over again about fears that I'm going to faint, or that it's not me panicking and that I have some deadly illness instead and that I'm going to die. I start coming up with scenarios about me dying of something and I hate even typing this out because somehow, I feel like even typing it out will cause it to happen like a taboo or curse. The thing is, it sounds like panic but I can't trust my own words because what if I'm wrong and I'm ill? What if I think I'm panicking but I leave it too late because of that and I die? I hate it, it happens to some degree about 3 or 4 times a week. Though sometimes it's every day. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it, but recently I've been going to sleep and waking up like 2 hours later sometimes, or I get this thing where I wake up really early and I feel all dizzy and lightheaded.
13512	285	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Does anybody get the feeling where there body feels really light and smaller as such during a panic attack, and everything looks plastic/fake sort off, it’s so hard to explain but have never met anybody the same as me?
13513	286	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	It is the worst thing I ever experienced in my whole life It changed me a lot ......I m not what I was used to be Everytime I m living in fear😨 or in depression that (something worst going to happen with me next) it's 1 year ago Everything is okay now but deep inside I m still not okay 🙂 I have lost myself
13514	287	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Anyone who's feeling constantly anxious, stressed and like it's the end of the world, i'm here with you, i believe in you and everything will be okay in the end! You are not alone.
13515	288	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I get really bad anxiety and I don’t really know how to control it… I also don’t wanna rely on medications because I don’t want my body and mind to think it cannot be okay without it.. My anxiety is accompanied by palpitations and diarrhea. I also tend to think of bad/negative thoughts on what’s stressing me which worsens my case. It’s also a headache and troubledbreathing for me. does anyone else get that?
13516	289	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	So like during panic attacks do u ever feel like A sharp mental pain starts stabbing into your head and increases fear and adrenaline and increases fight or flight stimulant Please tell me someone feels this i think I’m alone in this and i just want to know what’s wrong with me
13517	290	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have generalized anxiety disorder. Once I got an attack so bad that my right hand started paralyzing. I thought my body was going into paralysis. It's so hard to deal with stress with GAD because I can't control it. Mental health still needs more attention. Unfortunately wherever I go there's always something triggering... From politics to friends to family. The pandemic isn't helping either. Exercise, Yoga, meditation, Studies, Books and my mother are what keep me stable.
13518	291	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I got it often now. The feeling like my body and around me feel not real. Not nice feeling. Sometimes I feel like going crazy and mostly feel I am gonna die. I check my breathing and swallowing. It's going on for hours and day.
13519	292	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm having nightmares about it. I can't sleep. I'm afraid.
13520	293	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i just want clarification: are panic attacks like skipping a step while walking down a staircase but the fear lasting for hours?
13521	294	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	This only affects weak people
13522	295	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Chronic panic disorder since 2001, suffering for 20 years now. Tried over 50 different medications. Exposure therapy, cognitive therapy, etc. And what do you do when medication and therapy don't work. Homebound for 8 years now, panic attacks last 22 hrs. Sleep 2 hrs and repeat. Difficult to bathe/shower, go to the bathroom. Shaking and twitching so much, body so sore feels like ran a marathon. #helpshaunlive #shaunslifematters #poopieiscute #nscalesmallbudgetlayout #chronicpanicdisorder #panicattacks panic attacks don't just last 30 minutes... so much more severe hours, days
13523	296	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Knowledge brings fear
13524	297	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	does anybody else experience panic attacks that feel like a bad trip ?? like a bad trip that’s going to last forever n ur abt to die
13525	298	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm having one now... I hate this and I'm scared I'm actually sick and dying
13526	299	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i got a lot of panic attact from last 3 years。。。i m a overthinker and my heart rate is running too fast..i cant breathe
13527	300	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Does anyone have difficulty seeing and gets a white flash infront of their eyes when the panic attack starts or is t just me ?
13528	301	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Today I had my 3rd panic attack. They've all been approximatly 2 years apart, thankfully. And are all linked to the same trauma. I can barely believe that a past trauma can keep such a strong grip on you for over such a long time. Its terrifying
13529	302	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Anyone else’s panic attacks feel like a seizure is imminent? I’ve never had a seizure before, but I have this really odd brain feeling (pressure, internal ‘itchiness’, brain zaps) that makes me feel as if i‘m going to spasm
13530	303	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Overcoming panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder was the best thing that has ever happened to me.... I looked at this is a stepping stone in my recovery. I can finally say I see light at the end of the tunnel. 🧡
13531	304	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I feel like I can't breath when this happens, my lungs fill with oxygen I can't seem to use. My body isn't my own, im a bystander in my own head. It's almost as if my soul has left my body, I have phantom lungs that trick me into inflating them when their wisp-like structure couldn't possibly hope to retain what I need.
13532	305	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i think im havign a panic atack but idk if im sure or not like i was just watching a family friendly show randomly i start to cry and im having trouble breathing and i cant control it
13533	306	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I just had a panic attack. Trust me it's the worst😭😭😭😭
13534	307	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My first panic attack happened some weeks ago. I couldn't see anything out of my right eye, I couldn't put to words what I wanted to say. I couldn't feel my arms. I thought I was going to die. I've went to the emergency, to find out that it is indeed a panic attack. That was the start of everything, I have everyday this feeling of dizziness. It feels like the world isn't real. I'm glad I've found this video, it gives me the reassurance that I'm not alone. We are strong, we can do this. Fear can not hurt us. A panic attack can NOT hurt us. We will get through it. I wish you all a magical day, stay strong <3
13535	308	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've been hospitalized (ER) 12 times since the start of 2021. Prior to this year, it was manageable with xanax. My panic attacks (disorder) have been ongoing for 3 years now. It's absolutely awful. I feel like I'm dying. Having a heart attack. Stroke. Legs and arms go numb. I become unable to breathe. Chest pains. And I have no one to lean on to pull me through it whenever I have one. These attacks happen daily. Without any form of trigger that I consciously know of. I can just be relaxing in my chair with a cup of hot herbal tea, and then immediately floored. It's become so bad that I'll take 3-4 MG of Xanax, 2 orally, 1 under the tongue, and it STILL won't go away, and it's awful. I've recently started SSRI's (Prozac), and that STILL doesn't help. I don't know what to do or how to cope. I've become self-confined to my bedroom just to make sure I don't have one in public. It's horrendous, and awful. My heart goes out to all of you that are experiencing the same. It's truly one of the worst illnesses you can ever hope to have.
13536	309	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have permanent feeling of having panic attack, and I'm already got used to it. I feel like my throat is swallen all the time, I can't breathe and my heart is beating fast, now i ignore this but at first it was horrible. I felt like i was dying, and i called ambulance so many times. I did all medical tests and everything's ok, it's just panic attack. but sometimes it gets really worse, i have feeling like going crazy, I'm shaking and loosing myself, my hands are sweating, everything looks light, i have derealization and i cry and feel cold. The first signs that i feel before having seriously heavy panic attack is weird feeling in chest, and when I'm having it, i just drink water, lay down (wherever i am) and put my hand on my eyes and i wait till it's over. After 8-10 minutes it's over, but then whole day i have negative mood and feel weak. But sometimes, this can last for 2 months every day (it happened last year). Now I'm totally got used to it and i live with it, I'm having panic attacks in family, in public but I just ignore them and continue 🙃
13537	310	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Is it normal for it to last over 8 hours?
13538	311	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I just had a panic attack after I got out of an episiom salt bath? I called 911. My hands cramped up I had a hard time breathing, tightness in chest.. numbness and tingling in hands/arms..I threw up. Light headedness. Stomach.ache and heartburn..once paramedics came it subsided.
13539	312	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i’m having one this very second-
13540	313	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have a panic attack at the same exact time at 10pm every single night and sometimes it last for a few hours or sometimes all night and I never get sleep. I continue to pray to God that he heals me from this constant battle. It is so draining and exhaustive. But I know that He will deliver me from this.
13541	314	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I mostly have panic attacks when I'm doing intensive exercise (mostly cardio). So my guess is maybe I don't breathe the right way and start hyperventliating which makes me dizzy, numbs my fingers and I feel really heavy once I'm having the panic attack.. It's really bothering me because I want to keep exercising but am scared of these panic attacks coming back
13542	315	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i had a panic attack 30 minutes ago... i did breathing excercises, listened to calm music and talked to someone i trust. I experienced escalated heartbeat, numbness, sweat and not in control of my reality. i am bettwe now but the feeling is still lingering.
13543	316	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	This comment section lowkey makes me feel like home. It’s reassuring to see that there’s other people going through it too and you’re not alone.
13544	317	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	It literally feels like I’m dying, i get so scared and fearful that I feel like I’m going to die. I really wish this would stop. It happens over some of the smallest things sometimes.
13545	318	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm having a panic attack at the moment. I was just watching a video on YouTube and I noticed my heart randomly beating hard then eventually getting faster. I've had this for weeks every single day. Some lasted for a few minutes but most lasted for 5 hours or so. This usually happens when it's midnight where I'm left by myself in my bed with overflowing thoughts. The fear of having to face this horror anytime, anywhere really contributed to my anxiety which led me coming back to my depression and insomnia. Even though my friends, family and God had given me support and reassurance I still can't help feeling mentally crippled. I've developed trauma on things that had successfully triggered past episodes. I hope anyone who is on the same boat as me will be treated from this and live a happy, normal life.
13546	319	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Today i got too ...it was extremely scary....i was having little bit of cough..it felt like i will die in any moment due to Corona 😭😭😭..my whole body was shaking and i felt shortness of breath ...i ran away out of my room and it slowly i calm down
13547	320	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	In bed, 30mins in, slowly falling to a calm sleep of rest.. BAM, eyes wide awake, hearts racing, chest is tight, sweating, breathing is hard, I am dying. Stand up, rush to another room... Talk to myself, you did that before you're ok calm down.... Slowly relax.... It's 3am, I'm tired, i wish I was sleeping like everybody else.
13548	321	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I literally had my first one last night and ended up in the ER. I hope to God it never happens again, it was truly terrifying when it was happening.
13549	322	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have panic attacks every time I go to my university an it’s so embarrassing and scary. I feel that I can’t control it.
13550	323	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	just happened to me yesterday first time ever. I feel so helpless, it took every power over me mentally and physically, I woke you this morning so drain and tired but greatfull that it's a new day new start.

13553	326	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my first this year, it felt terrible, my heart was pumping so hard I thought it was going to go crazy after that my heart never felt the same and since I'm still 16 I'm scared that something might trigger another so I'm looking at this video to learn more, thanks for the info
13554	327	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	a few months ago I had a severe panic attack. I thought I was choking, I couldn't calm myself down, I tried to follow some advice, but I failed and it leads to install more chaos in my head and somehow forced me to believe that I was dying. I was so afraid that I called an ambulance and I went to the hospital. I had panic attack before, but this one was the one that allowed me to realize that I needed to cure it as soon as possible
13555	328	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	ive had many panic attacks and used my mental strength to make reasoning that there is nothing truly to be affraid of because of a traumatic childhood when i was around my parents again
13556	329	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Idk why but the last 3 weeks were a nightmare, with daily panic attacks and constant fear and anxiety about the fact that a new panic attack could come. But today I woke up so peaceful. Like I was experiencing a trance that suddenly disappeared. Why is this happening??
13557	330	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm strongly convinced a high insulin resistance level was causing the bulk of my panic attacks.
13558	331	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my first panic attack during class and I am an introvert and very shy which is why I didn’t ask to go to the nurse or something. I told my best friend that I had a really bad stomach ache and my parents thought I might have appendicitis but the doctor didn’t find anything unusual. I didn’t know the symptoms back then but I do now but I still don’t feel comfortable telling anyone about my panic attack.
13559	332	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i was diaginosticed with anxiety and panic syndrome with 13 years old, and while watching this i felt anxious and i was trying to remember the feeling of having several panic attacks in the same night...
13560	333	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had one at 15 years old. Someone close to me triggered me, and I went into a full blown panic attack. This was in 2010. I remember it started with my heart beating so fast. Then hyperventilating, but I couldn't breathe. then I started crying uncontrollably. Like WEEPING. This went in for like 10-12, maybe 15 minutes but it felt like an hour.
13561	334	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I suffered from Panic Attack Disorder for 2 months when I was 14, I behave like a 5-year-old who wanted to be with her mum all the time because I was scared of being alone since I knew I would think I was going to die. It was horrible, I could not be one second alone or I would start hyperventilating. During these 2 months, my mum had to call an ambulance 3 times because my heart rate would go too high and my breathing too that my legs would get numbed and my arms would start hurting as if I was having a heart attack. She would yell at me to be strong, so did my dad, we did not know what was happening to me or what was the cause of my behaviour. I took 2 MRIs to discard the idea that I had something not right in my brain, and all the doctors would tell me that what I was experiencing were panic attacks, but neither my family nor I had heard of such a thing before. We are from South America, and mental health problems are not commonly talked about, nowadays it is thanks to social media. But it took me 2 months, 3 ambulances and 2 MRIs to finally go to a psychologist and talk about what I going through, panic attacks 24/7, I could not even sleep ...the psychologist diagnosed me with Panic Attack Disorder and gave me Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and the 5 SECOND RULE, after one month of getting used to starting to live my life BY MYSELF again was such a victory for me. I later found out more people have this disorder for years and cannot get through it, and it breaks my heart because for me those 2 months felt like decades. My parents were really harsh on me to get better, they would not listen to me when I WOULD TELL THEM TO STAY in my room, and I really believe they made me stronger, because it only took me one month to get back to my normal life and go back to school. They push me to go out in the world by myself again, they still cared about my well-being but I truly believe that if they had not been strong and push me to get back to my normal life, I would still suffer from this disorder. Maybe not smothering gave me the strength I needed to get out of that state, but maybe it would not work for everyone because not all people are the same. My parents being harsh on me worked, but perhaps that is not the right answer for everyone. After those two months and one month of recovering, I have not had a panic attack, I used to have scenarios where I would start having one but with the techniques I learned I slowly started to have more control over my thoughts and not enter the panic attack state where everything becomes blurry and getting out of it is hard.
13562	335	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’ve told my friends to tell me “it’s going to end” whenever I have a panic attack around them, because while i’m having it, i really feel like it will last forever and it feels like hours that will never pass. It’s scary and I feel like I’m going to die every single time, especially when my hands go numb, no matter how many times I survive it and I know that I won’t die.
13563	336	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I am 15 and had my first panic attack it was so bad that i had to go to the doctor at 11:00 pm! I was sweating, not catching breath crying too much for no reason it felt like i was going to die! Its been 2 months and i am not able to sleep alone! It feels like someone is watching you! Its hard to put in words
13564	337	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’m not clinically diagnosed just because I’m sort of in denial that I have panic attacks which I learned just 3 years ago. I had one of my worsts while I was on a bus going to work. I had to get off and decided to look for a clinic. Luckily, I was able to still walk to the mall clinic while my whole body is trembling and my fingers were ice cold. My BP was normal upon checking but the feeling of drowning and feeling your pulse and heart pounding x3 of the normal, and feeling like you’re going to faint, those are the scariest about a panic attack.
13565	338	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	None of this information was available20 years ago when I was going through this. I quit the meds cold turkey with no support system because I was sick of how they made me feel. It was horrible but I survived, and don't need the meds anymore. And sometimes, there's simply no explanation for what triggers a panic attack. They can even happen during calm moments with no warning. I wish I'd just had someone to talk to during that time in my life.
13566	339	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My panic attacks got so bad when I was 18, I wasn't able to leave my house for days because I was scared I might get one in public and have no one around.. I lost 14 pounds within 3- 4weeks... I'd cry almost every night because I felt weak and tired of it all but as many people struggling with mental health, I was scared of going to therapy and getting help. One night at 1am I told my parents that I'm ready to see a professional and that is the best decision I have ever made to this day. It only took one session with someone who understood me. My appetite started improving and slowly but surely I was starting to stress less about my panic attacks. I haven't had one since, so it's been 4 years now. To anyone who's going through this: tell yourself you're ok and mean it! You are going to be fine. It will pass trust me! This is how I got out of a very dark place in my life and it took me months but once you start thinking optimistically and clearing your head of such bad thoughts, the attacks will leave once and for all!
13567	340	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had my first panic attack today in the shower. I was there listening to music and the next on the ground. The room felt like it was getting smaller, I couldn’t hear anything, my heart starting pounding, and I couldn’t breathe through my nose anymore. The air was getting thinner, so I just ran out of the bathroom. I told my mom but she isn’t really worried about it🤷🏾‍♀️. Anxiety was probably what caused it. I’ve been having anxiety about dying since January 😃
13568	341	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"I can always feel an attack slowly coming on . Choking feeling in throat, start feeling slightly lightheaded, heart starts speeding up, feel like I can't take a deep breathe. I get a lot of panic attacks driving and thats literally the worst place to have one. Although panic attacks peal within 10 minutes, mine sometimes last for an hour and I have had multiple 8n a day. Feeling lightheaded is for me the scariest symptom because you fear at any moment you'll pass out. Also the thoughts of death are recurrent during an attack. I have found that focusing on an object like a license plate while I drive works. Also breathe through your nose and don't take deep breathes otherwise you'll keep hyperventilating. I also fond that going outside for a long walk starts to slowly calm down an attack. Its a horrible thing to go through because you become agoraphobic and avoid places you think can trigger an attack. Vicious cycle. I don't wish panic attacks on anyone. People that don't have them can't understand the terrifying feelings panic attacks give you. My own family says ""you need to get over it"". Walk a mile in my shoes and maybe you'll show more support. I'm driving 4 hours next weekend to see family and i am fearing the road trip and experience for I won't known when and how many attacks will strike. Finally scheduled a doctors visit after years of putting it off. Good luck to everyone who struggles with this daily ."
13569	342	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Panic attacks have held me back all my life. I've lost countless opportunities due to this and it feels like a curse that can never be lifted.
13570	343	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My mother had a panic attack yesterday it was like she couldn't control her emotions and neither could we control her . It was very disturbing even for me to just see her suffer an attack.
13571	344	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Watching this after taking a benzo due to a panic attack. I’m relaxed now and also feel crazy that I thought I’m gonna die just 30 minutes ago. Our brains are full of mysteries
13572	345	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	After my first panic attack, I was terrified of having another one, which ironically is probably what made them more frequent. Thank you for mentioning that, since I’ve never seen or heard it in other panic attack resources.
13573	346	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I recently had a panic attack, an anxiety attack. And I still feel bad about it. I really wanted to go to the bathroom even though I didn’t want to, my hands were shaking I couldn’t hold a pen, I felt very cold and my heart was about to burst. I thought if I didn’t control me, I might die of a heart attack. An anxiety attack is not a game, it is not an option for mockery, mental illnesses are real. That day that attack controlled my life at a very important time for me, I feel ashamed, frustrated, sad and disappointed in myself that I couldn’t relax soon. That attack controlled a lot of time of my mind and body, because of that attack I lost very important time on an exam and now I’m at risk of being suspended. I really want people reading this to help if they know friends in this situation, don’t mock, please. Let’s be empathetic. And the people who suffer this I want to give them a lot of encouragement and they are not alone, we must be stronger and not feel bad.
13574	347	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My first panic attack at 12 made me feel almost like I couldn't breathe.It was the first time I felt my heat beat louder than ever.I was sweating like hell.I never wanna feel that again.....Never
13575	348	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had a panic attack about two months ago. I am scared every day now even looking at this video cartoons sends chills down my spine
13576	349	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Me: *finally goes to sleep* My brain 1 hour later: *EMERGENCY MEETING*
13577	350	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I feel like panic attacks are something you can’t describe or put into words
13578	351	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I tried CBT once for my anxiety, not recommended, really hearts in the groin area
13579	352	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Does anyone else experience panic attacks that last all day everyday? You get a couple of hours of relief but there's this constant pit of anxiety in your stomach,running through your veins. You feel like you're living in 3rd person or a dream,you have no control of your body anymore and nothing and no one matters?
13580	353	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"""The worst wars are the ones that only exist in our heads"""
13581	354	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	What my panic attacks are like: Hard breathing Sweaty Over thinking Blurry eyesight Muffled hearing Pounding heart Bad thoughts Cause of panic attack: Loud sounds Over thinking
13582	355	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Hey thank you for making this I've been having these more often and I needed to learn why I'm having them. I've been having more of them because after I had my first major one I didn't understand it and I've been worrying about the next one, But i also have been under major stress from a bunch of new moves in making
13583	356	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Just got my panic attacks under control! And now I'm getting them more! I freaked out over the god damn weather!
13584	357	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	the first time I had a panic attack I 100% thought I was going to die on the way to the hospital. It was the most terrifying feeling and I thought the nurse was joking when she said I was just having a panic attack.
13585	358	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm currently under SSRI and had my last attack last night 😔😔 It was an horrible experience, I pray no one ever faces this. P.s- A note to the people around them please be sympathetic and consult doctor as early as possible because it is kinda like a vicious cycle, getting an attack increases the chance of having another one drastically
13586	359	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I know it’s hard.. I know it’s the most terrifying feeling.. I know sometimes you feel hopeless.. I know your scared.. hurt .. probably asking God why am I going through this.. why do I deserve this.. all of this things I have asked and experienced first hand.. But I tell you this.. Read your Bible.. ask God for strength.. ask God to take it away.. if you do and believe he will.. I tell you the truth..!!! He will..!! I know your pain.. I know this is a hard road to walk.. and you feel alone... but you are not..!!! God is with you the whole time.. and I am with you in prayer.. With God all things are possible.. you can and will conquer this .. we will conquer this together with God leading the way.. 😇🙏🏽🙌🏽 God bless you all...!!!!!

13588	361	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Idk but like whenever I dont do a requirement or a school work on time or not do good at all, i always get this feeling of anxiousness and fear and i start to overthink.
13589	362	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I hate speaking in front of crowds or speaking to people I don’t know and I’m just quiet in general ((except when I’m with friends)) today at school the teacher started picking randomly to answer questions on the board , so I started panicking (my heart racing, hands shaking slightly) then she called on me and gave me three questions they were pretty easy and I solved them easily , when I went back to my desk my shaking got worse and I couldn’t hold the pen and my eyes started tearing up and I started breathing quickly Is this considered a panic attack ? And should I get diagnosed for social anxiety or is it a normal thing ? 🥺
13590	363	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	when i have a panic attack i feel me throat close and hard to breath
13591	364	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I hate it so much. It makes me wanna die.

13594	367	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	This is explained so good this is exactly what happens i feel understood i never seen a video explaining what was happening to me this helped alot
13595	368	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Me coming here after talking about cbt with my therapist

13597	370	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	My first panic attack was when I was really young I didn't know what it was but it really felt I was dying. My heart was beating fast, my brain was overthinking and my eyes was just watching everything that moves around me. I was young at that time so my dad would hug but now that I'm older and my panic attacks would happen mostly at night time and my dad isnt with me at those times so now i just rely on the internet for help.
13598	371	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I dont really get panic attacks but i start to overthink on a scary topic and i slowly start to panic over it and i cant forget about it... Pls like if this also happens to you cuz i wanna know if I’m alone or not :)
13599	372	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	started getting one watching this ngl
13600	373	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Just had one earlier today. Had to go home early from work. I am all okay now. I was ignoring the idea of panicking for several months now. It just did not work today. Did not search for this. Youtube just recommended it. Thanks.
13601	374	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Panic attacks cannot kill us. They are just feelings. You aren't going crazy, you won't lose control, and the world isn't falling apart. That awful feeling will ALWAYS go away. It gets better!
13602	375	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	what has helped me throughout the years to deal with it.was sleep well,not to over work/exercice,eat well,drink water,take care of your kidney ,heart stay away from caffeine .beverages as whole etc
13603	376	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	About half a year ago, I had lots of panic attacks, then I went to a chinese medic and he gave me a powder (a mixture of herbs and roots) and I had to take it twice a day, after only two weeks the panick attacks stopped, since that I have only experienced one small panic attack, that I could stop myself from getting worse. I am very happy that I don't have them anymore😁
13604	377	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Scariest and most traumatic thing ever, I have a few every month
13605	378	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have had panic attacks for 40 yrs. I hate them. They are a nightmare. PTSD and OCD. Suicide looked good several times. I just couldn’t!
13606	379	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I started feeling anxious while watching this for some reason.
13607	380	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm in so much pain that I don't know if it physically or mentally anymore
13608	381	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have questions: Can you die from panic attacks? How long can a panic attack last? Can a panic attack tire out your heart killing you? When you have a panic attack you start to panic right? So its like losing control. But is it possible to regain control during a panic attack?
13609	382	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	is it can cause dying?
13610	383	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	people always say a panic attack peaks within 10minutes blah blah blah.. my panic attacks can last for hours!
13611	384	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I feel no one talks about the part where you just have all the fysical effects of a panic attack, but no real reason. I have accepted my past (i had ptss), but since I am doing well again, I’ve been having panic attacks (when I went to all the traumatic events over 10 years and more, never had this), the first 2 months I thought I was dying every night, choking and calling the doctor every day to ask for help bc “I was choking and dying”. I learnt to control those attacks, but now, a year later, I still have nights where I am over alert and I react with fear to any unsuspected sound or flicker, my heart beats fast, I feel the adrenaline and fear in my body. I know I am not dying or hyperventilating, but these attacks last for hours and hours, not just 10 to 20 minutes. I just try to relax/meditate and also, my mind has no negative thoughts, but nothing helps. I try to go back in my past to certain events, and I just feel at peace with it all, but still, the attack is there. I talked to my therapist but my mind is at peace and he says I am doing all the right things during an attack already. I only have these attacks at night when I am alone, pry because people left me to be alone when I was younger, but I am at peace with these events, also I am in good contact with my family again. But I still have the attacks. I know how to handle them (asin; I am calm and I know there is nothing to fear, eventhough my body seems to think so, my mind is in balance) but they won’t go away and the feeling is just so disturbing and I barely sleep more then 4 hours a night.
13612	385	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Panic attacks physically feel like the moment you tipped too far back in your chair and about to fall, except it can last hours.
13613	386	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Having had thousands of attacked and done both therapies, I must stress that you all stay away from medication. They may help for a while, but once you stop or the dosage is no longer enough, you will have the absolute worse attacks ever. There are many simple techniques that work for me, so it would be much better if you found some that help you. If you want some ideas, I can make a list of what helps me. I still have them a few times a months, but now I am much better equipped to cope with them and at least I don't have them every day
13614	387	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I (so far) have never had a panic attack, and whenever I see one of my friends go through one it scares me, because I have no ability to truly empathize. I try and calm them down or distract them, the latter of which often works better than the former, but I really can’t know what they go through. :(
13615	388	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have panic attacks, but they are always random. First time i had a panic attack was definitely the scariest as I didn’t know what to do and I fainted. Then every time I had a panic attack I observed what worked best to stop it. For me, if I’m sitting down while it’s happening, standing helps. If I’m standing, then sitting helps. I also found that using controlled breathing helps most of the time. And now for the past few weeks I haven’t had any panic attacks so I’m very glad about that
13616	389	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I get panic attacks in bed, in the dark when I think about one day i'll be gone and dead.
13617	390	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i simply doesn't care abt anything atm, because if i simply care even if its just a simple matters i often hyperventilating about what could possibly go wrong, and even worse if its involved another person, how long will i dissapoint him/her?. help
13618	391	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Finally some good info
13619	392	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I watch this after seeing Uncut Gems and that I by far did not know anything about that movie and that I never watched trailers of it, my brother took me and my mom to see it and, I had so much panic attack from it!!
13620	393	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had a panic attack a few nights ago... I thought I was having a heart attack and thought I was gonna die
13621	394	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	So panic attack is a reaction of people taking fear and panicking to the extreme.
13622	395	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I've had panic attacks that have been triggered by nothing. Its scary because it literally feels like your going to die
13623	396	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	what triggers my panic attacks are - eye contact - loud noises - silence - tight places - crowds - people looking at me - speeking in front of people (even if it's one it can trigger my panic attacks) - when I see myself in the mirror (sometimes) - my phobias I hope this made sense these are all that I can think of right now but of course when I get a panic attack it's not always in these situations I sometimes get them randomly with nothing triggering them
13624	397	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	WELLCOME TO THE PANIC ROOM WHERE ALL YOUR DARGEST FEAR ARE HERE TO COME FOR YOU

I just really didn't know that they exist and the thought that something ""in my head"" could be so overwhelmingly awful was beyond my belief. I would feel depressed, empty and without much apetite about one week after the attack. I'm doing much better now though. But I'm wondering, has anybody had such a bad one before?"

13650	423	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’ve had a few panic attacks in life. My anxiety just overtook me. I’m on anxiety meds now, so I don’t get them often anymore, and I don’t have as many stressful situations. I’ve had times where I almost had a panic attack recently. I hate them. They’re the reason I hate taking my nebulizer, I hate my heart racing. I come from a family that had genetic heart diseases, you never know when you’re gonna drop dead from a heart attack or something. It’s scary. I just can’t handle it. I’m afraid for my life when I go into a panic.

13655	428	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	i just felt this at 8:00 since im having my midterms exams but it was the worst
13656	429	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"I feel like a lot of people overuse the phrase ""panic attack."" As someone who goes through panic attacks quite often, it's sometimes hurtful to see people over exaggerating their emotions by comparing them to the scary experience that a panic attack gives you, and then laugh about it. idk, i just hope people can understand what it's like so that they dont affect others who go through the struggle."
13657	430	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Whether your having a panic attack or trying to help someone through it, the best way to start is to get the person panicking to focus on their breathing and stop hyperventilating. Recommend a cold glass of water as well.
13658	431	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	May Allah protect us all. I wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy. Please pray for me and everyone else who is suffering from this

13661	434	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	As someone who would have up to 5 panic attacks a day let me tell you how it feels. It’s like you are literally seconds away from death and nothing can make that feel any less real. Meanwhile feeling like you’re going crazy and having to try to hide it from anyone around you, especially if it happens in public. Then when it’s finally over you’re so exhausted you feel like you’ve been hit by a truck.
13662	435	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	It took me 4 months to identify it, otherwise I had assumed that I am having a life threatening disease. Once you identify it, u can control it, else u would feel dying in minutes. Only those who have had got panic attacks can get ur feelings, talking them will be really helpful n make u confident. Cheers to life.
13663	436	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I scream, kick, and cry when I get a shot, every time, I don’t think I get panic attacks, but sometimes even the mention of shots makes me panic
13664	437	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had a panic attack while watching this, because it's so bloody true that it made me anxious
13665	438	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I experience panic attack whenever I speak with my family members . I feel guilty for being in such position to avoid family. Panic attack completely ruined my life.
13666	439	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"My way of dealing with anxiety attacks: instead of fearing them, I literally say, ""c'mon! do your worst!"" I may still get them, but the fear of having one is gone."
13667	440	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I’ve had tons of panic attacks last year (due to several causes). Just thinking about that really traumatizes me. It really was not a fun experience, i’ve been throwing up, got my hands freezing, and my body trembling, also it’s so hard to breathe whenever the attack comes. Luckily after some therapy sessions, I feel so much better and can handle all the symptoms better. So to whoever reading this and facing similar experience like me, hang on there and find help. I hope you can feel better soon😇
13668	441	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had one after two puffs of weed, worst experience of my life. That’s when I learned the difference between panic attack and an anxiety attack. So different. My respect and perspective for mental illness changed forever.
13669	442	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I'm kinda missing the part how to help others in an immediate panic attack.
13670	443	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I never had them, I wonder what it’s like
13671	444	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I feel so sad reading the comments and see how it's so common. I've never heard, see, nor experience panic attacks (and I'm tremendously grateful!!), panic attacks are extremely rare in my place. I hope noone have to ever go through this :'((( I wish you all well! ♥️♥️♥️
13672	445	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	So I was told by someone that having panic attacks isn't like it is on tv, where people need a paper bag to breath. Sometimes your heart beats excessively and you get nervous, like the type of anxiety you get before a class presentation. My heart beat would be like 120 all of a sudden and I'd be extremely anxious and stressed. This happened when I woke up, at work, throughout the day. I thought I was just anxious. Nope, those were small panic attacks. I spoke to a psychiatrist and tried regular methods without drugs and ended up taking the lowest dosage. Suffice to say, I havent had one since. Little did I know that meds actually work, I was just afraid to take them.
13673	446	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	Me: There are some times where I get really anxious. Therapist: Oh, are they panic attacks? Me: Nah, I don’t get those. I just start hyperventilating, shaking, crying, and feeling nauseous. Therapist: Yeah, that’s a panic attack. Me: Oh, so that’s what that is.
13674	447	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	As someone with anxiety, I can appreciate you guys trying to educate people on panic attacks.
13675	448	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had severe panic attacks for 6 months, where I literally felt like I was gonna die. I believed it was triggered from stress stockpiled since my youth. At first I had a lot of trouble stabilizing myself and I would breakdown and go to the emergency couple times thinking I was going to die. After learning what it was I had to convince myself that the symptoms: Breathlessness, dizziness, loss of appetite, heart rate out of control, stomachache, palpitations, impending sense of doom; that these were all imbalanced chemical reactions from my brain. It wasn't easy. Like almost everyone I fear death, but after many sleepless nights, I almost embraced it, I just didn't care anymore. My faith in God helped tremendously through prayer. It would help take my mind from only focusing on the symptoms which would make me panic even worse. My advice is when you get bad episodes; convince yourself that you are not dying, but that you are experience a chemical imbalance from your brain that will pass. And also distract yourself or divert your attention from the symptoms to anything else; for me it was prayer or confiding in a friend or family member. If you do these things you may eventually be cured from panic disorder. I thank God im cured from this disease when there are people out there that have been living with it for years.
13676	449	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I can't be the only one who laughed when they said that CBT can help with panic attacks

13678	451	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	TedEd: Why do we get panic attacks? Me: *I have generalized anxiety disorder...*
13679	452	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I have some pretty major anxiety, I think partially caused by a whole lot of things I've had to deal with. As a result of this, a lot of innocent-seeming topics and words are major trigger words for me and seeing a bit too much of it can send my mood spiraling down rapidly, overwhelming me with either a significant feeling of anxiety that prevents me from thinking about anything else, or a straight-up panic attack. As someone with autism, I find it very hard to fully grasp what I'm feeling, and for anxiety or panic attacks that's the same thing. I know that what I'm experiencing is bad, but I don't really know what causes it or even what it is exactly until I'm knee-deep into the problem. Sometimes I don't even feel it coming up and instantly land in the spike of the issue. I find it extremely hard to find help regarding this — not only do I find it hard to explain what I'm feeling (where the problem's coming from, what caused it in a particular instance, what emotions it makes me feel, where it makes me feel those emotions, how it makes me feel physically, what I'm thinking about, etc.), that sort of information, but also... I don't know who to go to to get help. I'm not super independent as I still live with my parents and they still manage most of my things as my autism makes it very hard for me to take care of that stuff, so if I went to a therapist (if I even managed to find one), they'd likely find out. I don't want my family to know, as I know they tend to react to things like that in ways that only make the problem worse, whether that be never leaving me alone, telling others about it or anything of the sorts. They don't know that I deal with anxiety and panic attacks regularly, but I'm definitely not planning on telling them.

13682	455	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	"In my case, I had a panic attack during self-defense lessons. That one time we were assigned to ""fight"" (not really as we were beginning to train), just the thought of having to fight made me so anxious I couldn't breathe and I didn't even make a move or a blow to my opponent. Is curious to me because in all my life I haven't physically fought someone, although any confrontation makes me really nervous as well. (Ps i joke saying its because of my last life but who knows?)"

It legitimately feels like you're dying when in the throes of an attack.
13690	463	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzFObkVRSV0	I had to stop my study very early for anxiety disorder. But people did not know or if the knew they would call me psycho. After almost 12 years later still people question me why I did not study further. But I have no answere for them. I have no job now and I see no hope of a job. Only God knows what waits for me. May be my life will end oneday without any gain, without any respect. But hope nobody goes through this situation like me.

It was the scariest moments in both our lives. But it was also her last attack. Being there for someone who is having an attack is crucial, It's the same with a bad LSD trip; they think they are dying, you need to be there to anchor them and tell them they are going to be ok. This experience will pass, you will be alright.

He locked me in a closet for 7 hours straight and it was dark, i couldn't see anything and panicked, hammering against the door the whole time while being stuck there in such a small space. After that I always get panic attacks when People in my class do jokes and turn of the light or if its dark in general. I dont get treatment and im fine with it.

13750	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I had meningitis when I was around 5 years old. I remember how much pain I was in I couldn’t sit up.I thought I was gonna die my head hurt so bad everyday and I had to wear sunglasses when I went outside my room for some reason because I was sensitive. I needed help walking and I was in a pretty small room with a bathroom right across the hallway. It kinda traumatized me a hospital had to turn me away because they couldn’t help me and I was so scared. I got to ride in a ambulance though and that was pretty cool. Most nights I had to go to the hospital for a IV and I thought it was a fun trip but I was so clueless. This all started because of a ear infection, I get a lot of ear infections and I can’t have water in my ears at all. This was one of my more serious events but I’ve had to stay in the hospital many times because of my ear infections. yeah thanks for listening I’m kinda traumatized of this but I’m glad I’m okay now-

13756	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Herbal medicine is 100% guarantee of meningitis cure, the reason why most patient are finding it difficult to cure meningitis is because they believe on medical report, drugs and medical treatment which is not helpful to cure meningitis. Natural Roots & herbs are the best remedies which can easily eradicate meningitis so herbal medicine is the best remedies for it. I was once a patient of meningitis now I give thanks to spiritual doctor. Contact Doctor Oje on YouTube channel is there for you.

13760	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Wow. 1987... I was six back then. Wonder why there weren't any lockdowns or mask mandates back then hyukk!
13761	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I had meningitis when I was going through my battle with leukaemia. I don’t remember any of it though as I was very young. I was on chemo therapy at he time, so my immune system was just an open gate to any bacteria. I’m so thankful for our NHS in the UK that I’m here today 😊 I now have short term memory problems either from this or the fungal infection that I had in my brain. Either way I’m still kicking so can’t complain!
13762	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	"My parents are heavy anti vaxxers, fortunately I grew up to be exactly on the other side, when I was little they did refuse to get me vaccinated except for chickenpox which was mandatory. I contracted meningitis while I was about 3-4, I fell in a coma at home, my parents took me to a doctor who insisted I was just sleeping while my mom held me in her arms, unconsciousness, another doctor checked me and sent me to another hospital right away, I still remember when I woke up in the hospital, pretty much the only memory I have from back there, and I told my mom ""that was a nice sleep"" and realized I'm not at home. As I grew up, when I was about 14-15 I realized how important medicine is to humanity and how much it did help us throughout the history, ever since I became 18, I got myself vaccinated and all the medical care I needed, one point I forgot to mention is that after I got out of the hospital, my denture started decaying real fast, throughout my childhood that was a huge issue, by the time I was 14 I lost most of my teeth, had them partially redone when I was 18 because my parents were still against anything that included a doctor, despite the fact that I am still alive due to doctors and the knowledge of medicine we have gathered throughout the history. I also had migraines my entire life. Get your kids vaccinated, do listen to your doctors and most importantly, consult multiple doctors, some are better, some are worse."

He was terribly sick. He was very close to getting meningitis, if left untreated you could go deaf. either way, we had a risk of my brother going deaf. because the surgery was a bit risky, and might damage something in his ear. November 11th 2016, 2:36 pm, my mom rushed into the waiting room telling us the surgery went smooth with no complications, and he was going to be fine :)
13785	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I remember my mum got bacterial meningitis back in 1971 when she was 2.

I woke up with flu symptoms. And in the evening I felt something was wrong. It’s a good thing I went to the hospital because the doctor said that if I didn’t I probably would’ve died overnight. Unfortunately I hand triple amputation of my limbs , as well as fingers on the remaining hand. This is one of the worst things that has happened to me , I had all my vaccinations when I was a child but it still can happen. I will be forever traumatized when someone says they have the flu or cold. Fortunately it did not affect any of my organs and did not leave any brain damage. I am grateful to be alive, but physically this is a challenge I’m on YouTube to look for some inspiration to move forward.

I got infusions every day, and sometimes doctors took samples from my spine. I would probably be very scared if I got it now, but I wasn't aware of all of these at a very young age.

I’m doing hajj this year inshallah make dua for me :)

13823	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Extra reading; there is no single 'meningitis bacteria'. Bacterial meningitis is caused by many organisms including but not limited to: Streptococcus pneumoniae (gives rise to pneumococcus meningitis and is commensal in a significant minority of people's throats), Neisseria meningitidis (gives rise to meningococcal meningitis, typically presenting with the non-blanching rash), Haemophilus influenzae (The B serotype gives rise to aggressive, preventable meningitis), Listeria monocytogenes (typically only affects pregnant women, neonates and occasionally the elderly) and Group B streptococcus (neonatal and elderly meningitis) and atypical causes like E.coli (which can come from a septic UTI) There are vaccines available for MOST of these bacteria (PCV, MenACWY + B, HIB vaccines), but not ALL (Listeria, group B strep, E.coli and a myriad of other atypical causes, not even including viral, fungal and protozoal causes like naegleria fowleri). Additionally, you may not be up to date with your vaccines, each is designed for a different 'serotype' of each bacteria (N.meningitidis has 5 in A, C, W, Y and B that you can vaccinate against), and depending on when you received it, you may not have full coverage, as some are newer than others. TL;DR, 1. Antivax is irresponsible and misguided, so don't be unknowingly complicit in it. 2. Track down your vaccination transcript and make sure you're covered. 3. Don't gun to get the pitchforks if someone has meningitis, many people will develop it from causes outside of vaccines coverage.
13824	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	My husband had meningitis a couple months ago. He can no longer see out of his right eye, has chronic migraine like headaches and has short term memory loss because of it. He was turned away by Drs and ERs for almost a week (they thought it was a cold) and then he was finally hospitalized for a week. We live in a small apartment with our 3 sons and he's the only one that got it, thank God. We still see his PCP weekly for it. It's one of the scariest things we've ever been through.
13825	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Had it when I was 16 years old. Meningitis type B to be specific. Realized it after 3 days leaving me paralysed on the left side. 2 years later I kinda got back to normal life but close case
13826	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	This is kinda misleading. Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges resulting from an infection, whether bacterial, viral, or fungal. So a number of different nasties can cause it, including West Nile Virus, Listeria, and some strains of strep throat. My friend's dad almost died from meningitis after having the flu. It can even (rarely) come from non-infectious sources like certain cancer treatments and penicillin. Get *all* your vaccinations, folks, not just the big baddies!

13835	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	"Why is ""risk of amputation"" a so commonly used phrase? It makes it sound as though body parts just spontaneously fall off as a direct result of the disease (which rarely happens with some diseases, in which it is called ""auto-amputation""). ""Amputation"" isn't the risk, it's the treatment. ""Risk of tissue death in the limbs, necessitating an amputation in order to prevent the death of the patient"" is more accurate."
13836	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	4:33 is showing an easy way to detect if you might have meningitis. Simply grab a glass cup and press it against abnormal red spots. If it is not meningitis, the red spot should be suppressed to skin color and only return red after you lift up the glass cup.
13837	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I had a brain hemorrhage at the age of sixteen (the third instance, actually, in a series of brain hemorrhaging that began at the age of twelve) caused by a rare brain arteriovenous malformation, which caused many of these symptoms, making it an elusive and difficult to diagnose illness. The doctors kept jumping to the conclusion that I had meningitis, which is fair, considering I basically had all the symptoms of it, but also frustrating for me because I knew deep down it couldn’t possibly be meningitis considering I’d had two previous episodes of the symptoms that would eventually go away until the next bleed in my brain. Anyway, I thought I’d share that, and I wanted to say: anyone with these symptoms should always seek prompt medical attention - it may or may not be meningitis but it could be something else!!
13838	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Confusion is mostly a feature of encephalitis. Can happen in meningitis too.
13839	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Nice to see this video! When was 13 years old, I had meningitis. For several night I would wake up at 2-3am and cry to my mom about very awful headaches. She kept insisting it was just dehydration or something not so serious and kept disregarding it. By the 4th night the headaches were making me nauseous and I always felt like passing out / throwing up during the day and especially at bed time. My mom knew something wasn't right then and asked my dad to bring me to the hospital, but he refused initially and asked me to man up and deal with the headache until it goes away. (I live in Canada, healthcare is covered. My dad always hated seeing doctors for whatever reason.) After enough arguing between between my parents my dad finally brought me to the emergency room, where not long after I was seen by a doctor who after a few blood tests, spinal fluid test etc determined I had pretty late stage of meningitis and that the infection was really close to making me lose my vision, hearing or life if I hadn't intervene sooner. I had Meningococcal meningitis (bacterial meningitis)
13840	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I actually was in the intensive care unit last year around Christmas because of bacterial meningitis .. I was sedated for three days. The doctor said if I came 1-2 hours later I would have been dead. It’s a miracle that I don’t have any permanent damage. It took me like 2 months until I fully felt like myself again ... this disease came so fast and i had no clue until I saw the red spots on my arms and started googling. After that I rushed into hospital where I’ve been treated totally wrong after I already mentioned meningitis. I lost my consciousness and I woke up three days after in another hospital (thank god!).

13843	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	*It's amazing to think that i had meningitis in grade 3 and it's really this serious! I've recovered from it within 1 month.* I honestly DON'T think this is a serious disease nowadays with medical care. I was in treatment on hospital bed and I had the viral version. I don't think too much of it.
13844	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Quick action DID save my life. I had meningitis when I was 30 days old and it left me with a bit of a learning disability for which I have learned to compensate and left me permanently 100% deaf in my left ear. Most of the time, this doesn't cause me issues aside from not being able to tell where noises are coming from and issues with wearing headphones where a stereo signal to only the left ear doesn't let me hear everything. Had to watch this video to learn more about the disease that helped mold me into the man I am today.
13845	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I had bacterial meningitis as a six month old baby! Can't understand how I'm alive, I will always be grateful for my parents and my aunt for watching me over 24/7 at the time. I lucky didn't have any serious consequences, aside from little white spots on my permanent teeth from all the antibiotics I took, but I had them removed!
13846	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Get to the doctor, unless you're in the USA then you pray it away. Cause the hospital bill is worse then death. Murica!

I'm Brazilian and if my daddy hadn't a ""medical care convenience"" of his job, I probably should be dead roght know... This desiase is terrible... Thanks The Life gave me the opportunity to keep living. This video made me feel like I can die anymoment so I need enjoy every little moment..."
13849	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Very interesting. I had meningitis when I was fifteen, exactly a week after I got the vaccine. While I think vaccines are absolutely necessary (especially for keeping vulnerable folks safe), they don't always work perfectly.
13850	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I have a question, this video only shows the transfer from one person to the other, but what about the origin? Where did the infected person got it from? Let's say we go down the chain and find the Patient Zero, where did she/he got it from? Is the bacteria/virus always in the air? Or are some animals that we consume host to such bacteria, anyone please?
13851	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	This disease is the best tool for human beings to become extinct☠️

13853	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	They could've included more info on the viral and bacterial type
13854	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	So how did this disease develop? Ive never had any vaccines before and now I dont know what to expect.
13855	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Please make one on misophonia! It's agonising for people who have it and very few people know about it and it's not even considered as a mental disorder even when there's proof!
13856	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I am starting to hate this channel because it scammed me by iphoneX give away. WTH did you do that?
13857	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I had meningitis... All I could do was lie down in the bed, eat and drink. I remember vaguely, but I barely even moved and my head hurted when I watched screens or actually any sort of light. Took up my entire summer holiday. And although this is unfortunate, I was overall lucky I only suffered so much! Apparently meningitis is much more harmful and can be even lethal.

13863	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	Many people believe that your Anti-bodies will help prevent any sort of disease. Well vaccines are basically a dead or neutral virus so when injected into your body your anti bodies will be alarmed that a unlnown substance is inside of you thus attacking the dead/neutral virus. This now keeps the antibodies inside of you active for a long period of time. So without any vaccines your antibodies are like uneducated soldiers who don’t know what to do
13864	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	I work in admissions at my university and even if the student is all good to go, they can not registar for classes if they do not get this shot.

My doctor said I’m at an increase for meningitis infection and now this video has been doing the web md panic. I’ve noticed for going on weeks now I’m my eyes have been more sensitive and the back of my neck stiff. And I don’t think I’ve gone a day without a headache or overstimulation in a while. Thanks for the video. Good thing I also just got insurance

13871	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	The video is damn creepy if you listen with headphones😱
13872	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaQdv_dBDqM	"This is why i hate anti vaxxers. They let their child not take vaccines all because of some bogus ""studies"" and risk their kids catching such diseases. The worst part is, they are also compromising herd immunity. It should be mandatory, for *EVERY* parent to vaccinate their child. The measels cases in America, for example, have risen from zero in 2004 to 600 in 2014. This is alarming as many children have not received MMR ( Measles Mumps Rubela) Vaccine and are thus prone to catching it."

13887	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJoQj5-TIvE	For anyone curious, in 2019 phase 1 of the trials was finally given clearance by the FDA, and the trials are estimated to begin this month (March 2020). Sadly things like this take a lot of time, and the study isn't even estimated to conclude until 2022, so it'll be a long while before it can be used in practice, assuming the trial is successful.

Making 20 different meals may overwhelm an aspie, with all the different ingredients, But making a few favorite meals everyday may be more comfortable. Or having 20 friends may seem confusing, when having a few close friends seems more comforting."
13941	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I have done some right crazy stuff in my life! I have AS! Still to this day do I take people literally. I'm pretty good at reading emotions though, but I used to be an angry and unhappy person for many years. I look at some peoples behaviour and it makes me pretty proud to be an Asperger's. I drink responsibly, I keep myself clean, I don't smoke, I am polite and people are always telling me how intelligent they think I am, but I have had difficulties that made me into a bitter, sad and angry young man! )':
13942	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I have a mild form of ASD (mild Aspergers most likely). I would say I’m fairly intelligent although I do struggle relating to others and feel like an outsider. There are benefits although the social side really does suck. Hopefully there will be better treatment in the near future for the social side of stuff as I would like to be able to relate better to people. Oxytocin sounds promising but needs more research and investment.
13943	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Wow. Is this why when I was a child, I taught myself how to physically show emotions in the mirror?? Like I was a 5 year old girl, in the mirror teaching myself how to show that I am crying and sad, and teaching myself how to show when I’m happy with my face... I used to see friends getting their needs met, and I had a hard time expressing myself so I was going nuts inside myself. Blows my mind that I am 31 and just got diagnosed with spectrum disorder earlier this year. Extremely emotional. Of course, I now have BPD on top of that tho, and depression, CPTSD, and crippling anxiety... I was also misdiagnosed with tourettes and bipolar and drug thru the ringer with meds that I did not actually need but that made me a fat zombie with anger issues. Then I was used as the scape goat. Then my dad died, I was 19, no clue how to function. Dated abusive narcissistic who would help me survive because functioning has been so damn hard. Never understanding what the fuck was wrong with me all these years. My mom beat it into me that I was just born defective and bad and she used to blame my father because his sister was a drug addict. Because that somehow means he was responsible for my issues. My mom is a bad person 😭😭😭 and my dad got cheated out of life. My mom drank and smoked during her pregnancy with me.. maybe that caused my spectrum disorder idek But damn, this is a wild ride. For the first time in my life last year, I saw someone do the same tics I do... it made me suicidal to be 100% honest. Going my WHOLE life never seeing anyone like myself, thinking I was defective and a mistake who would never amount to anything or ever be good enough. It’s emotional to see I am not alone. Very very emotional. 🥺😭😢😓 love u guys. Stay alive. We deserve to be here. I love u :(

13946	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	As a child I started out as outwardly 'exceptional', and then over the years I've slowly lost myself through masking. I'm just now seeing how damaging my masking has been for my mental health and well being.
13947	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I have asp and I used to kick off at school because I was bullyed by p7 when I was a p3 and now I love volcanoes
13948	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Sometimes I wonder if I have something similar to aspergers. I interpret things diff from others and its extremely frustrating to other people. I like being alone. I'm naturally gifted at anything I try, but then get bored quickly. For example, my dad encouraged me to play golf. I started playing golf and when I was decent enough to beat most people, I quit. Same with Jujutsu and everything else I do. Im good at everything but great at nothing. I reverse engineer problems and it used to drive my math teachers nuts. I don't know.

13951	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Idk what to tell actually. I actually know there is something about me. But i dont know what. I dont want to self diagnosed but clearly i know there is something about me. I have no social activity. I mean its rarely happen. I have a lot of problem with people. Understanding them. In everyone eyes i look like someone with no emphathy. Yet in the end i know i what i said earlier is wrong. So i regretted it. In my view i was joking about something. But in other side. They think that i was very rude. And i have a really unique things about myself that making everything is clear. I was so obsessed with actress/celebrity biography. Again. I want to make it clear that there is still many things to solved. But i have no source for it. Still a student but want to reveal it myself. Without my parents knowing anything about it. There is still a hope. Wish me luck

13955	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Nonsense. High IQ is nothing to do with Aspergers. It the social thing/ moody, touchy, inferiority complex, sensitive, rude, nasty, moaning, negativity, lazy, defensive, aggressive, bating for arguments... basically it's terrible for close family members!! from personal experience... all the things and much more are traits of Asperger
13956	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	My nephew has aspergers, be kind everyone. He’s a gift and we love him the way he is. He’s funny, smart and does his own thing.
13957	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	is asperger’s considered autism?
13958	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	My brother is asperger, I always see it but others don‘t at all. He learnt everything. Reading body language, expressions, eye contact (he never breaks it), he is very intelligent and has a great humor
13959	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I met someone with assburgers
13960	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I never used to stare people in the eye, it was so intimidating I felt watched and judged. But I read one thing about confidence and now I never stop staring/never look away when someone is talking. 😂 I do my best to feign looking away.
13961	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I’m 25 and i think i might have asperger. It feels like something is missing in my brain, like someone cut a chord connected to my brain. I can talk to people and understand sarcasm and human emotion but i can’t form deeper connections and relationships and i’m always alone and barely go out. I only do so when i have to buy something. I used to have 4-5 friends (before my teenage years) i could hang out with anytime of the week but got bullied in 4th and 6th grade. After that i kinda changed and became the ”quiet kid” in class. 6th grade we change schools in my country and it goes all the way to 9th grade so it was a new class but i new some of them from my old school and one of them was my friend. Anyway after this happened my mentor/teacher always said to my parents that i need to interact in class more (because they grade that too) that i’m too quiet...anyway this followed me all the way through higschool. 10th grade. New school, new class, new everything. At this point i only spent time with my neighbour who joined me in 7th grade (here things gradually got better) and two people i knew from my soccer team since i was 8. I had basically cut ties with old friends etc. We didn’t text or talk at all. Anyway i spent about 2 months in my new school before i made the decision that i wanted to change school and subjects so they hooked me up at some economics high school. I thought it would be good for me to meet strangers and expand my social network because i felt like i had too. Having 1-2 friends wasn’t gonna cut it anymore. Not in high school. The moment i joined my new school and class was mid term so all the others got a bit of a headstart to get to know each other and form groups and friends. Some of them were already friends from before. I got the chance to introduce myself and they all seemed friendly and all. I remember 2 guys and 2 girls really made efforts to get to know me and be my friend but i was cold and rejected them inderectly without even knowing it at the time. So i was alone until school closed in summer and we were about to begin 11th grade. I felt uncomfortable and changed school again with new subjects. This was more of a nature science school. Lots of math and physics. Basically the future engineers and doctors go to this school but this meant that i had to do 10th grade over again so i was 1 year older than the rest of my peers. But same thing happened here. And it was a nightmare for 3 years until graduation. I didn’t make a hard enough effort to connect so i was the outcast. In the beginning i sat with them at lunch but as they were talking i couldn’t say a word. I didn’t know what to say. I thought they would ask me something but they didn’t. This was 1-2 months in. After this i ate lunch mostly alone or sit 1-2 chairs away from random people. If reading this you know how bad it is so i’m skipping it to the last part. Graduation day...i had do drink shit loads of beer and champagne just to cope with my failure. I didn’t have great grades and the awkwardness being around my class mates celebrating even though i ghosted for 3 years made me sick so i had to drink just to cope. I had not a single friend to take a picture with or to talk to. Just my family. And here i am the exactly the same as i’ve been all those years but with improvements. Ofc i can talk to people whenever i go to the store, dentist, doctor etc. but sometimes after talking for 1-2 minutes my brain feel like the useless small talk is done and i can’t think of anything meaningful to talk about so there’s an awkward silence in the room and then they ask me if i’m ok. I hate this part the most. I don’t hate the person, just the question. I didn’t know at first why they’d do this but i searched it up and people can apparentely think that you’re annoyed or don’t like them and thus your silence makes them uncomfortable and this applies to extroverts especially but this ain’t that lol. So nowadays i always have anxiety before an appointment because i feel pressure to talk and entertain them. That’s not me and don’t think that’ll ever be me but i defintely still need to improve my social skills because i need a girlfriend...but no one wants to be around a guy who’s boring and don’t talk on their own. It’s not that i’m insecure about myself or anything but like i said it’s like something in my brain that’s holding me back. Ever since i was 19 i’ve thought i had asperger but i’ve never gone to a doctor to be tested. The ones i ever talk or text too are my dealer or acquaintances. I wouldn’t call them my friends. We used to hang out maybe once a month. Sometimes once every 2 months. They’d write to me or i to them too just asking what they’re up too. Sometimes i got invited to go out with them and their friends where we went to the club. But i cut all ties with them after reflecting and processing my thoughts. My dealer too. I’ve been using drugs recreationally for the past 3-4 years to escape my lame life and escape my reality. When using i could be who i always wanted to be or anyone. I’m usually on my PC. Used to be a hard gamer in high school, only thing i looked forward too was get out from school and go home to play counter strike. It stimulated my mind. But after graduation i was 19 and needed a job. I was still living at home at this time so i got a latenight job. Was a bitch to sleep at day though but i got money so i didn’t care. I quit the gaming since i neither had time or energy to play. It was work, come home, eat, sleep, wake up, eat, repeat. This shit drained me. I’m a big fan of hip hop/rap and u know how they promote drugs. So it was around this time lean or purple drank became so popular world wide. Teens started drinking that and so did i. It makes you kinda relaxed and u get a great fucking sleep. So this was my new stimulation. I drank in my room, watching TV, Youtube or listening to music nodding. I became addicted before i knew it. Almost a year after i got my license it got so bad that i even drank before driving. I almost crashed my parents car on a bridge when picking up my sister from practice. I fell asleep for 2 second almost driving on the opposite lane. That’s when reality hit me and i got slapped by my mom and had to explain myself. That’s when they found out what i’d been up to. Stopped drinking lean and switched to alcohol. Now 20 years old. The age when u can buy booze in my country. What’s better than alcohol? It’s easy to access and it’s legal. I continued working at that nighshift place until i was 22. Sometimes i was slightly drunk at work but they wouldn’t notice because i had high tolerance and we work alone. Would usually have a couple of beers. Weekends it was the heavier stuff. 22 i quit my job and been up to no good since. 22 i started doing drugs. From weed, to ecstasy, to speed/adderall. Here in europe our adderall comes in a strong smelling powder. It’s phosphate, usually white or yellow. This is much stronger than adderall as pills. I used this up until today with no job or people to socialize with on the regular. It has been my friend and girlfriend. It was all i needed. I didn’t care about anything else. Getting high was all that mattered. I could go 2-3 weeks without using. Like i said it was recreational use. 2g-5g i binged in 2-3 days. But then i got phsycosis and drug induced schizofrenia. I saw people that weren’t there and heard voices in my head and songs over and over again. It was terrible. I needed something to slow me down so when i felt i was dond i used xanax or pregabalin 300mg. Sometimes i combined the two. 25 today and i feel like shit. Been a month since i used now. But i cut all my contacts. My face looks terrible. The speed gave me horrible breakouts. I got acne scars and hyperpigmentation all over my face. My sister though who is normal and younger than me, has a boyfriend and two jobs. She’s the opposite of me. An extrovert, lots of friends and previous boyfriends a life that i always wanted. My life is really sad compared to hers. She’s been to New York as an exchange student and Barcelona, Warzsawa and Croatia with friends. And Cyprus one week before graduation. I’ve been to Turkey and Las Palmas in Gran Canaria but that was just us. My family. Now she’s paying for chemical peels for over $150 to fix my ugly mug. Was there on Tuseday this week, going again next week. Results are great, the dead nasty skin is already peeling off. It’ll probably take a few more peels to get clear skin though. But i know she’s doing this because she feels pity and sorry for me. I’m still at home and on bad terms with my parents. We don’t really speak much because i’ve lied to them 100 times and been using behind their back while saying i’m clean...they’ve given me 100 chances. It’s a miracle they haven’t kicked me out yet but it’s bound to happen soon if i don’t change. I’m basically in my room24/7 on my laptop just spending time on Youtube and Reddit where i can read similar situations to ease the pain. It feels a bit better that i’m not alone but it still sucks. I do think there’s something wrong with me, that i have asperger. But if i decide to go see a doctor it’d take months before i get a possible diagnosis because they need to hear my whole story, talk to my parents, possibly formers friends, teachers etc. It gives me a headache when i think about it. Too complicated but it would help my daily life if i’m diagnosed so people would understand me better and i finally accepting me as i am.

I also don’t feel different and have lots of friends at school, so I’m questioning this diagnosis.

13969	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome because my reading level is higher than my grade
13970	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I’m flashbacking my entire childhood while watching this video. No wonder I felt so different and so alone, and I would usually talk to adults more than the other kids at birthday parties. I can’t exactly understand sarcasm, people have to point it out for me.
13971	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I was diagnosed with Aspergers at 6, so please explain to me how I am one of the top salesmen in the business I work for, also have a good sense of humour and have good empathy with customers! Explain THAT!

13973	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	school counselors have mentions asperger’s before but my parents don't really care so i don't know if i'm weird or if it's my fault because i will probably never get tested
13974	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	So do I have Asperger's syndrome or not ?
13975	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I am 12 and when I was 8 I think they diagnosed me with asperger. But, my mom used a lot of sarcasm, so I can understand sarcasm, and I sometimes use sarcasm too. But I don’t have that many friends, in fact, it’s difficult for me to label someone as a friend, and it’s easier for me to socialize online than in person. Another fact is that I am from Uruguay, and here we speak Spanish, and I learned English at the same time that I learned Spanish. I don’t speak as fluently as my dad, but I’m close to it. Wash your hands (Coronavirus) and take care :)

13977	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I dont know if I have this, but it is difficult to look at the eyes, people think that I am angry because of my face, but i can be dying of happiness, i have all the things of this, like when i had specific interest since when i was a child like building things or maps that i still loving and is a pleasure looking to the world maps my friends gave me or playing with the world globe of my friend, but the thing is that when i was i child i always knew when people died, when my grandmother died when i was 3 years old, my mother just told me that she is in a trip, but i knew it wasn’t true, and i made her think that i was like another baby, and I didn’t say anything else, I don’t know why, i remember a lot of scenes from that time, from 1 to 3 years old and beyond, but between 1-3 years old, in that period i was thinking that how is possible that humans can exists, because i was so amazed of how i can feel, how i can think, how i can be organic material, how i can feel emotions, how i can make stories in my mind, and it was hard to believe that how can someone else could be like me, and i started to think that maybe all of them (family, humans) are blank like a white piece of paper, like something inserted them into the world to fill all the things but they were not human without thinking without emotions, really, i wanted to see someone from my family bleed or see their veins in their eyes in order to know if they are like me and if this perfect organism is posible.
13978	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Asperger's..... What a way to name it scientists.
13979	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I have Asperger and I’m also socially awkward. It’s a pretty bad combination
13980	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Are people with Asperger's on the Autism scale?
13981	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I feel so different than other people. I'm going to go check it put because i have so many of these characteristics
13982	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	i'm not self diagnosing here, but i've been told by my autistic friend that i should get checked. i have several fidgets which include bouncing repeatedly in a chair when i'm tense, i have a habit of biting my tongue when i'm nervous, picking my lip. i've had several obsessive interests in my life, which include, but are not limited to: satellite dishes, fluorescent lights, and air vents on top of houses. i would stand in a room for several minutes at a time to listen to the sounds of the lights and i would extensively research everything i was interested in. i've also had episodes of what i can only describe as being totally overwhelmed, which included my throwing everything out of my room. and throwing objects without even thinking about doing it. i'm not the best at socializing and i usually have to think VERY hard about what to say. i tend to stutter and not make eye contact, when i talk to people i tend to fidget because i get overwhelmed. i'm hoping someone with aspergers here can give me some insight. i want to know if i should seek treatment because my parents brush off that i'm autistic and refuse to have me seen by a doctor.
13983	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Autism is linked to vaccine research it.
13984	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I'm diagnosed as aspergent also. Yes, I feel like an alien among people.
13985	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I don’t have aspbergers but I have always been gifted. I saw a story I wrote in preschool and it was shocking; It was something about a helicopter enjoying nature’s paradise (keep in mind I was 2). And what really surprised me was the fact that there were no spelling or grammatical errors.
13986	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Alot of what he is saying is true. I have Aspergers and im very sarcastic, literal in some ways, and i cant be bothered with people if i know its gonna be a hassle or if they are too emotional
13987	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Why do people care so much about eye contact?
13988	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I don't get this. It sounds like a simple description of one kind of human being. How is this a disorder?
13989	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	no fap cured mine. I couldn't watch people in their eyes and I am really and I mean really smart. I skipped the last 3 months of high school didn't study and still passed my cxc's and graduated with 7 subject passes. my parents sometimes think I'm crazy because I don't go out and be in my room in darkness and total silence but that's not the case. I just be in my room thinking and meditating and I don't find interest in social events. I'm also from the ghetto of a poor country in the Caribbean so my intelligence makes me stand out. I started college but have no interest in it and skip a lot. I try to convince myself to go but because I'm not friends with any of the students it's uncomfortable for me there
13990	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I have Asperger's and I'm 13
13991	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I am the only one who has it Aspergerov sindrom ?!

13993	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I was diagnosed with Aspergers but I can easily read people’s emotions and I appreciate sarcasm too.
13994	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I don't know if I have this, I kept getting put in speech class because my teacher was was worried cos I didn't talk to other kids, just her xD. I just didn't like those bastards lol. If I don't like them, why should I talk to them?
13995	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Hey dude, could you reply to this?: I was diagnosed with severe adhd when I was 7. Although I always thought I may have something more, I ignored it. I've recently looked into aspergers, and I have most of the symptoms. All of which were mentioned in this video, anyway. I want to talk to my psychiatrist about it, but I really don't know how to go about it.
13996	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I have an asperger and I'm proud of myself.
13997	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I’ve been wanting to write a short story about a main characters with Aspergers. This really helps, thanks
13998	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I was diagnosed with Aspergers this year, I’m 13 at the moment almost 14 and while talking to strangers my age is difficult I’ve managed to create a small friend group and even get a boyfriend who I’ve been with for 4 months now, I’m getting good grades in English and other topics due to my extended vocabulary so I really don’t see a lot of downsides to my disability. However, I was always worried that my disability would prevent me from finding love (along with my physical appearance, just ew) to the point where I thought no one would find me attractive which was proven wrong by my bf who surprising had a crush on me without my knowledge! To everyone with aspergers, while it may be difficult you are all capable of doing whatever you set out to do, it may be difficult but you have to have confidence in yourself. 💖
13999	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I'm so ashamed I have it. I thought it was anxiety OCD pstd. I have a 130 iq but can hardly work
14000	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	There's a girl in my class who has aspergers and she doesn't talk to anyone except me and 3 other people and the teachers when she absolutely has to
14001	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	aspergers sound like the next step in human evolution, im serious.
14002	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Ive grown up hiding my Asperger's syndrome the try and fit in with different groups I now feel as I don't know who I am and who I become for others I just want anyone with Asperger's or who has a child with Asperger's to not become someone else.
14003	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I have this, i hate it when people sniffle.
14004	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Is it Aspergers or are these children so intelligent that the adults are labelling them as having a disorder... everyone is different and who says what is “normal” social behaviour who decides this any way 🤷🏽‍♀️
14005	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I have Aspergers :(
14006	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	wow so many smart people here lol
14007	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	So Asperger syndrome just means you skip being a child
14008	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I just realised that I may have aspergers
14009	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	So...how does one with Asperger's deal with the social difficulties?
14010	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I believe I have aspergers as I have all symptoms, but here in India, no one knows about it, and every one think I am just too shy and that is my mistake
14011	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I’m confused , I have most of the signs and difficulties. Except the non literal interpretation thing I have no problem whatsoever with it . Do I still consider to have it ?
14012	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Seems like Aspergers can be easlily misdiagnosed to high intelligent people...or?
14013	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	ass burgers
14014	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	"I have Asperger and I found a letter I wrote about all the knowledge I had of space when I was 10 (I studied space for 2 years): (This is all spelt how I spelt it as a 10 yr old girl) ""Space is a mysterious wonder, most people don't understand that the edges of the world don't egsist simply because space is infinite; however, if people are referring to the earth (like 'the edges of the earth' etc.) the earth is infact a demented oval and cannot have any edges. Most people think that the earth looks just like the one you see on globes, but little did you know, because of the rapid rotations the earth makes, it causes the earth to inherit a rather unusual shape. Furthermore, space is infinitly expanded, scientists still don't have any proper evidence that space is infact a mysterious infinite wonder. Even I struggle trying to find out if space is infinite, their can't just be a void that you cannot go past... earlier in the year, I thought that Maybe, just maybe, space could look a little like a half eaten hamburger, if you know what I mean. As you can see from this text, space IS in fact a mystery......"" I was shocked when I saw the letter.. this was from when I was 10... EDIT: This is 2 years later and i completely forgot about this haha.. i’m now 13 and i did write this when i was 10 just trying to sound more grown up by saying that i ‘wrote’ it when i was 10. the half eaten hamburger statement threw me off as i was re-reading this haha and that is smarter than i thought i would’ve been. i obviously know more about space now and it still aches my mind to think that the world is infinite. but now the even bigger mystery to me is space time and it really confuses me, for example, there’s a planet 53 light years away from earth, if we (somehow) teleported there would we be 53 years into the past? or when we look through the telescope would the ‘present’ simply be just the past? this is the problem that i ran into and i realized its because we measure time by how long it takes OUR earth to completely revolve around OUR star. and it made me wonder if we could use a universal ‘clock’ per say, that just made me realize that it isn’t the problem of us using OUR earth and OUR sun to measure time, its ‘time’ itself that’s the problem. so if there was something else that we could use to know what’s going on ‘right now’, then that might partially cure our problem. but then the answers just branch off into more questions, harder and harder to answer. sorry that this comment is so long haha and if you actually have read this far i respect you, thank you for listening to my rant, ~”that 10 year old girl” almost 3 years later"
14015	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Huh... No wonder, I already know I have that but I still like to listen to stuff like this.
14016	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Yup I got asperger
14017	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I'm laughing while hearing this cause my entire childhood is flashing before my eyes and now I understand why I always felt so different
14018	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	Speaking as somebody with aspergers people like me expect logical reaction. What we get, especially with children our age is that they're not logical. They experience peer pressure, something I never understood. Peer pressure is not a thing for me. If somebody tells me to do something and I don't want to I say no. They pressure me I tell them to fuck off. This is confusing and personally I tried to stay away from it. Teenagers especially are emotional wrecks. I wanted nothing to do with those kids. On the other hand I did go to a psychologist on occasion. We talked math, space-time, etc. Some life's question. Philosophy, etc. and I loved that. Everyone agrees that emotional teenagers are assholes on occasion. Why do you expect us to get along with them exactly?

I also feequently invoke awkward situations during social environments because I act in a way others wouldn't find normal. While I do extremely well in areas I am very passionate in and in various axademic subjects, though this isn't the same for everyone, I have even nearly been in trouble during school affairs for another student feeling uncomfortable around me and taking my actions in a way they were not intended.

14029	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPqtWlZ9mU	I remember when I was little I was taught a different language (because my family is from a different country). My parents sent me off to a summer camp/preschool kind of thing, and they were worried because they thought the counselors there wouldn't be able to understand me because I didn't know English. Then when my parents came to pick me up they asked the counselors if they had a hard time understanding me because I didn't speak English. And counselors were confused because they said I was speaking perfect English, even better than every other 4 or 5 year old or there. My parents were confused too. I had somehow learned English just from hearing other people around me talk and listening to normal TV shows (not kid shows). And to this day I don't have a weird accent in any language. I speak English without an accent and my other language without an accent.

14044	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDtuPrcS3Zo	Hi. I'm Sharon. I was able to overcome my rheumatoid arthritis naturally. Before I was exposed to this natural remedy for healing all types of arthritis, I was once a victim of this debilitating disease. I suffered a great deal from recurring pains in my fingers and the deformity had been a sad structure. My fingers were crooked and thus, it was impossible for me to partake in any able-bodied activity. I was practically damaged by this disease. This led to my prompt resignation from my job. Quitting my job was the most downhearted experience I ever had to go through as a sufferer of this disease, especially as a single mom to two preteen girls. This disease had worsened over time . I was screaming consistently as a result of stabbing pain, should I use my hands for any kind of physical activity. The pharmaceutical recommendations were not favorable to me at all. It was as if the more pharmaceutical products I had depended on, the more severe the situation became. This whole painful scenario had continued for a longer period of time after my diagnosis in March, 2015. Until providence had issued this natural remedy to me via the professional assistance and guidance of an African herbal doctor. A friend in West Africa encouraged me to try natural herbal medications and so he went ahead to introduce me to one herbal healer. This herbal specialist, Dr. Ugo ( ugoherbalhome@gmail.com ) is responsible for my natural recovery from this disease. So I reached out to the doctor asap for professional guidance in reversing rheumatoid arthritis. I was very impressed at his knowledge of naturopathy and the zeal he had shown in wanting to help me overcome this disease naturally. I was thus recommended some herbal products by this healer of which I had used for a brief period of time. The pains stopped immediately, in accordance with my complete recovery from this disease. Initially, I had thought the disease had only gone into remission, until my finger outlines had begun to take accurate forms. I am very amazed at my quick recovery from this disease . No one deserves to suffer like this. The pains can be very horrible. which is why I want to use this opportunity to connect with as many sufferers ' from this condition ' as possible. You really should try this natural remedy for a quick relief from pain, and also a permanent cure to this disease. I do hope to have used this piece of information to resuscitate hope to anyone going through the same ordeal atm. I love you all

It was a sad experience for me after I had found out I had been diagnosed with arthritis. At first at the realization of the news, I was taken aback because I had never wanted to be in a position that would be difficult to handle. It was of some sad oddity to even realize that the pharmaceutical medication that was recommended was not favorable to me at all. My finger outlines were deformed and as I was hurt every single moment, the pain was unbearable and I was desperately in search of a permanent remedy to get rid of these dreadful disease called arthritis. I was soon to deviate another alternative in improving my condition naturally. It was during my ceaseless search for a definite remedy that I stumbled across the professional works of Dr. Harry Obiego - an African herbalist and natural healer whose works had surrounded natural herbs and their benefits from mostly Dr. Sebi's theory. An information was passed online of his professional experience in healing the incurable ailments via a naturopathic process. The content of the information had elaborated that the process of his healing was traditionally and naturally oriented and that the aforementioned herbalist had successfully cured a number of victims from most viral ailments such as HIV AIDS, Arthritis, Asthma-related problems, erectile dysfunction, paralysis and many other ailments via traditional methods of healing. For proper understanding and guidelines, I had contacted this African herbalist with whose professional directions and his recommendations I was able to receive my healing naturally without any side effects at all and under only a little period of time. I wish to use this opportunity to reach out to any person who by faith may stumble across this piece of information and who may be facing any health challenges currently, to hopefully reach out to this natural herbal healer for assistance in battling their health problems. You can reach this herbal doctor via his email: drharryobego@gmail.com WhatsApp: +234901 616 1406.

The Emu oil don't work and neither do any of the othe other ointment creams and crap these bastards are trying to sell ya. The only thing that works is something you don't want to ingest into your body. They are things that will kill your immune system and then you'll die from cancer or something worse. Your best bet is to just find a clean and painless way to end it. Otherwise your just going to spend your life making these horseshit doctors and drug companies rich. To that I say fuck no!!!

They will NEVER offer it...You could be crawling on the floor in agony and thy just smile and say... see ya next visit... 2. Here is how rhumy diagnosis and treatment work. - Come in for initial visit. basic exam and then $1500.00 worth of blood work. No pain meds. - 2nd visit a month later...They all do Sulfasalizine or Methotrexate- get a RX - No pain meds - Next month - $1500.00 of blood work..assess if meds helped - no pain meds - 2 months - assess if meds helped $1500.00 of blood work... no pain meds This is how the VA and the civikian Rhumys work. They never are in a hurry, Meds take forever to work, Never discuss pain relief, barbaric treatment. no concern of value of life with pain."

14135	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEizkwusd6Q	Before any one does this remember it has no real benefit to your diet doctors state that it will not really help you lose weight ( this is a friendly reminder to check your facts!)
14136	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEizkwusd6Q	I drink a cup of green tea with honey & lemon in the morning and night and I drink AVC in the afternoon before my lunch. Doing this, dieting, and exercising WILL work to help you lose weight. Over the past 6 weeks I’ve lost 30lbs. I went from 170lbs to 140lbs. I feel much better about myself and much healthier. It’s takes dedication and discipline!

14162	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEizkwusd6Q	Can we use any brand or just Bragg ones
14163	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEizkwusd6Q	"you really won't notice weight loss for about 3 months. Weight loss is not permanent if you do not change your eating habits. Always rinse your mouth out after you finish drinking acv. It will discolor your teeth. The plan I am doing is 3 tbls of raw, organic acv. it has ""mother"" in it. I started 1 t spoon 3 x's a day for 3 days, then just gradually increased acv. The drink I now make is 2 Tbls of acv, 1 t spoon raw cinnamon, a couple shakes of cayenne pepper, 1 t spoon of ground ginger. I make this concoction 3 times a day."

14176	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o39NrSwfb8	I just realized the PREDATOR JACK, is from the movie Predator when he jumps off the tree and lands next to Arnie lol

14189	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o39NrSwfb8	Is it possible to gain a body like this with only bodyweight exercises?
14190	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o39NrSwfb8	This of course is for advanced Level Fitness People and should never be engaged by entry level gym or Fitness Members . Too many Gyms have Thier Aerobosarous Instructors integrate stuff like this in Thier Group Fitness Class when the people walking in the door can't even stand straight . We need to get away from the idea of Putting Fitness Astetics before addressing Health and movement Limitations

14253	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	he sounds like Gordan Ramsay explaining working out recipes
14254	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Him: 41 years old Me: 𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗬⁉️
14255	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	They should’ve named this “Train like the devil himself”
14256	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Him: 41, looks like the devil Me: 15, looks like moldy cheese
14257	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I just searched everyone's names up and turns out all of them except Mazzikeen is over the age of 40 and ella doesn't look a day over 22:0
14258	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Wait.. He have curly hair?
14259	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Whats the song at 0:17 [Urban Tension Dangerous City]
14260	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Remember people, even the devil doesn't lift without a spotter.
14261	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	this man is getting ready to play James Bond, and he will be amazing. Don't you agree?
14262	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"When he says ""Paulo""; he sounds just like he's in character."
14263	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	If Tom put out a workout program as Lucifer, I think there'd be a lot more fit people
14264	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	If he didn’t have his accent, he wouldn’t be the same
14265	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Can´t take a guy who trains with gloves seriously.
14266	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	If this is what the devil looks like, nobody would go to heaven
14267	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Next episode: Tom Ellis shows his Miranda workout routine.
14268	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Watching this 10% for the exercises and 90% to admire Tom’s body
14269	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Damn his accent and his looks everything about him is legit PERFECT. how ?
14270	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I would love to go hell if devil actually looks like him.
14271	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Honestly shoutout to Tom for including his personal trainer, his trainer essentially made his body for Lucifer
14272	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	not many people in their 40’s look like THIS. his wife is BLESSED. 😭
14273	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Cant think him out of frame. He still looks devil outside the frame.
14274	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why does his trainer look like he's getting turned on lol
14275	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I just realized they always straighten his hair as Lucifer but the natural curls he has are cute af
14276	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	DISGUSTING SHOW. TURN YOUR LIFE TO CHRIST BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.
14277	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Yeah, kids, that's how actually natural bodybuilder looks like.
14278	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	omg why is no one talking about the fact he’s gary in miranda i will literally never see him any other way 😂😂😂
14279	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	His trainer looks like a demon disguised as a human helping his boss to lift weights.
14280	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Ahhh... A man who uses kilos, much appreciated.
14281	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	When you arrive to the hell and the devil doesn't look like tom Ellis. Me: i feel cheated
14282	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	No one: Not a single soul: Not even god: Chloe: **exists** Lucifer: DETECTIIIIIVE???
14283	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	why is his trainer spotting him so much, he really doesn’t need it, especially on the shoulder press
14284	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"Where is the part where he just stares at the camera & ask everyone: ""What do you truly desire?"""
14285	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"*Tom Ellis emerges from the water* ""Oh sh*t..."""
14286	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Can someone please tell me how to start doing more pull ups !! i can't even do 1 correctly.
14287	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	*Tom Ellis facts:* - He’s 41 years old - He has a wife named meaghan oppenheimer - he has 3 kids Nora Ellis (14 yr old) Florence Ellis (11 yr old) Marnie Mae Ellis (7 yr old) - He actually has a British accent - He was born in Cardiff in the untitled kingdom Oh, he’s also extremely attractive.. Yes I said the United Kingdom lmao
14288	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Anyone else just watching this to watch his muscles
14289	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	So wish more YouTube trainers spoke as calmly and naturally as this. It’s a joy to listen to
14290	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Tom: *does 4 sets of 10 for basically everything* Me: *does anywhere from 5-10 sets of 10 for basically everything* Apparently I’m doing more overkill than the devil! Not sure if that’s good or bad!😅
14291	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	The trainer constantly touching him during the movements is very strange. Spotting is one thing, but that's ridiculous.
14292	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	WAIT HE TALKS LIKE THAT NORMALLY OMG FUK ME DADDY >.< lol
14293	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Everyone talking about his more recent roles, but I will only ever see him as Gary from Miranda 😂
14294	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	“OOH my bum feels nice” - Lucifer
14295	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"""Lucifer workout"" barely seen without a shirt in Lucifer."
14296	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I am convinced he is the most handsome person to EVER walk the earth.
14297	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"the title should have been ""train like the devil"" this time. sigh."
14298	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	So tell me, fellow commenter... What is your biggest desire?
14299	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He knew what he was doing when he uploaded this. He knew that every girl that watched Lucifer would most definitely watch this for one reason. He knew.
14300	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Tom Ellis: hello!- Me: *falls over*
14301	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	4 simple steps to become as handsome as him: Step 1: Be attractive Step 2: Don't be unattractive Step 3: Win the genetic lottery Step 4: Don't lose the genetic lottery
14302	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why is he wearing a shirt the entire video? _where's the suit?_
14303	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Tom is the type of guy who calls Lauren German “detective” off camera
14304	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I’ve watched so much Lucifer it was strange to not hear a sex innuendo every other sentence😂
14305	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I can’t be the only one who knows him from Miranda 🤣🤣
14306	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	his eyes look different then they look in Lucifer?? idk he probs wears makeup
14307	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Hearing Lucifer's voice again sounds refreshing after I've finished season 4 just few weeks ago. Why is season 5 not out yet?!
14308	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	No one: Lucifer HELLOOOO DETECTIVE
14309	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Guys, cut the personal trainer some slack, he’s just seen Tom’s real face and hence isn’t speaking, he’s still in shock
14310	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	you mean: Lucifer Explains his Tom Ellis workout
14311	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	거대멍뭉이.......하 광대안내려오네
14312	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	My ovaries exploded after this
14313	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Oh he actually has a British accent 🤣
14314	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why that trainer is looking like a dummy to me?
14315	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	What about Tom's legs? He has plenty muscle on the top but none on the bottom...
14316	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	The only thing missing was abs. How the hell does he have those abs.
14317	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"I deadass thought he said ""so in terms of reps and sex"" at 4:40."
14318	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	The moment I realised I lift more than him and I'm still skinny with a bit of belly. Sad.
14319	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Do i regret watching Tom Ellis working out while eating noodles? Umm Not At Oll!
14320	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	As i can't imagine someone as Harry Potter other than Daniel Radcliffe similarly i can't imagine Lucifer as anyone else other than Tom Ellis
14321	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	40 pounds heavy shoulder press 😂
14322	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He does HIIT before lifting weights ? He should sack his trainer !
14323	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	ITS SO WEIRD SEEING HIM WITH CURLY HAIR AND NOT IN A SUIT😭😭
14324	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	he's the hottest thing to walk this earth
14325	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"I been repeating the ""slow walk out of the pool and take a drink"" routine for a few days now, not sure if it's doing anything"
14326	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Am i the only one who think that he kinda looks like chris pratt?? With that beard
14327	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Trainer looks like Keiran Lee and MCU Quicksilver had a love child.
14328	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	why does it looks like he's training his personal trainer lol
14329	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Keep swinging the weights like that you’ll tear your rotator cuffs
14330	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Tom Ellis: *Works out* Every girl in a 10 mile radius: *Water splashing noises*
14331	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"Tom: says ""warm-up"" Me: ah yes the easy part Tom: runs 12 mph"
14332	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He could really improve this by a lot if he had a decent personal trainer.
14333	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I feel insulted that this guy is actually trying to teach me how to workout 🤨
14334	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He’s not ripped or jacked. Why are we listening to his workout?
14335	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I like how he said its good to have a trainer to help I get ur weights up but then he just stands behind him and doesn't do anything lol
14336	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Someone tell him after training. Check your wings
14337	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Remember how he looked in season 1? dude improved a lot
14338	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This guy has some serious talent in acting no joke
14339	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Every since this show aired, I’ve had random people stop me thinking I’m Tom Ellis. Not to be rude, but I’m not as handsome and I didn’t know who he was until the show aired.
14340	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He protecc He attacc But most importantly, he is lookin like a snacc
14341	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why his trainer look like that one pornstar
14342	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This dude should be the next 007. He's perfect for the role - he wouldn't even need to shave off the beard. EDIT: I'm shocked with all of these likes and comments. Lemme enjoy the opportunity and ask you to subscribe my new Gaming channel! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2RAEqjXJF_hlOOQ8gtw6g
14343	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Lucifer pretending to be Tom Ellis for a workout session
14344	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He’s so hot I’m gonna cry
14345	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He was basically like, I cannot believe this show hasn’t gotten canceled yet, so I guess I better get in better shape.
14346	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Tom Ellis doesn’t look like he works out he just looks like he was born that way
14347	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why does his workout look like shit but his body is so well defined?
14348	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"wtf, hes doing the bench press and the text says ""Squeeze your glutes..."" Someone did not pay much attention to this edit..."
14349	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Everyone is complaining about how horrible his trainer is or how horrible his form is. Idk what going to the gym/working out is like but honestly it looks like they're doing something right if Tom looks that good. He's got a fair load of muscles on his body, that should count for something. Ever thought maybe they don't care about they're doing because it's just for the sake of this video?
14350	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Tom, I love you, but your trainer sucks. Please take the time to watch Scott Herman's reaction to this workout video, and take him up on his offer of training with him. You won't regret it.
14351	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Where's the Scott Herman fitness people at?? This trainer is pretty GAHHHHBAGE
14352	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Whos here after Scothermanfitness roasted his trainer?
14353	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Who’s here from ScottHermanFitness?? P.S. That squat form is GAHHHBAGE
14354	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Here because of Scott Hermann 🙋🏼‍♀️
14355	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Who's here after Scott Herman roasted his workout xD
14356	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This might be the worst personal trainer ever seen
14357	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Um, curling with your back against a pillar kind of defeats the purpose of the wall curl. His elbows aren’t touching anything.
14358	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Honestly feeling kinda bad I'm reading all the comments how everyone came here to talk about how hot he is and I just came to talk about how bad his form is
14359	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	scotthermanfitness?
14360	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Anyone here watching his life being threatened by his form?
14361	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	you need a new trainer to teach you form and a proper workout for weight training 🤦🏼‍♂️
14362	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I feel this is the male version of ‘must have perfect body’ same way women are made to feel shit if they aren’t ‘skinny’. As my guys say they still feel pressure just like women. Not sure how positive this message is... yeh be fit & healthy but I don’t feel this video has that message :/ This isn’t hate btw! Just feel it’s all about looks & pressure to look a certain way.
14363	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Props to the trainer for making a proper program with actual exercises, not those bs programs/exercises so many celeb trainers make their clients do.
14364	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I may be only one here for the actual workout lol
14365	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	No one: Tom: 2:31 “Paolo? He’s so good”
14366	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Huge fan and I work out. But 20 mins of HIIT before weight training? You only need 4 mins for VO2 max. Your warm up just needs to get your blood going for 5-10 mins. Save your effort for your resistance training. Dynamic stretching would do the job. For the gains people.
14367	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Enough with the bs, and talk about all the juice you've been taking for it, mate!
14368	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He should hire another trainer, for his height and weight he's pretty weak
14369	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Since no one else is mentioning it, that looks like a great workout to try!
14370	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I need to watch again because I’m sure Tom was talking about something or other but I didn’t hear any of it the last ten times I watched.
14371	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	5:18 finally , good old kilos! ;) I hate when people speak in football fields per fahrenheits
14372	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	any other girls here? 😂😂😂
14373	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Those weights look light af? Your ass probably used some alternative steroids
14374	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Straight, gay, bi, alien, whatever you identify with, you cannot deny how incredibly hot he looks 😂
14375	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Omg is that lusifer?!?!

14378	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"""Hello Didektiff"" diyecek sandım 😂😂😂"

14385	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	How is he an actor? He’s so awkward

14389	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	PLEASE slap me around and strangle me
14390	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I'm not even listening to anything he's saying, I'm just fascinated with his existence that's all:)
14391	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"His trainer is standing there like, ""Shouldn't I be explaining this?"""
14392	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Marry me! 😍

14395	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Terrible bench form. And the spotter is helping all the way up and down. Congratulations.
14396	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Your trainer is absolute GAHHHHHHBAGE. Listen, I am a HUGE Lucifer fan. It's actually one of my favorite shows. Tom, you are a brilliant and amazing actor. But your trainer has complete shit form on all your exercises and is spotting you way too much. I think you look great, but if you hired me for a month I could take Lucifer to a whole new level. I am 100% serious, let's make it happen.
14397	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	What if Lucifer actually convinced us he's an actor just to star in a show about him
14398	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This seem a little too basic for a celebrity workout
14399	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	No celebrity is idiot enough publish they're workout and eating regiment. Thisi is just a publicity workout you can find on google, don't be fooled.

14401	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Who else came here just to see Tom Ellis and not give a shit about the work out?
14402	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I know this if kinda an odd question but how would you work out if you have asthma?
14403	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	his warm up would be my workout
14404	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"Tom:""another great compound movement"" Also Tom: begins single movement shoulder press"
14405	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I may be a lesbian but even I can appreciate how beautiful this man is.

14408	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Wow Tom Ellis!!! Just love him ...The best Devil ever🥰🥰
14409	174	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	When he said ohhh this is heavy whilst doing squats just shows that hes a good actor i genually beleived him for a sec
14410	175	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I do same things, except squats, knees efed up, so my squatting days are over.
14411	176	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I'm literally sitting here reading the comments and just dying 😂😂
14412	177	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He is ising that thing... in his hands? Like my little sister 😂 only womens use that boy
14413	178	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I think Lucifer might be gay
14414	179	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I accidentally clicked on this video. I don't regret it
14415	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Didn’t even touch his chest while benching, I guess the devil doesn’t have to do stuff right
14416	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This is one hell of a training ! Keep grinding !
14417	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	His 20min warmup of running and sprints on the treadmill is already my Entire workout omg 😂😂😂
14418	183	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	imagine if this guy was trained by jeff cavalier. we gonna have super buff lean devil 😂
14419	184	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	If I did the Tom Ellis workout I will say nope I’m out yeeet bye and I will be dead tired in the end
14420	185	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	To look like that without steroids you will need to be much, much, much stronger than this character.
14421	186	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	so he does cardio before lifting weights.. someone should tell him that’s not the way to build muscle.. it’s pretty simple😂😂😂 How tf you gonna build muscle when you wear the muscle you have out. the body doesn’t work like that
14422	187	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"Surprised he's actually natty, as opposed to 90% of Hollywood actors. Takes way longer to get in shape without HGH, testosterone, etc. And obviously natural athletes have a lower ""ceiling"" aka won't look like comic book characters."
14423	188	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	awfull please don't be a musclor it was charming a lucifer without muscles like all the preatty loozer. you were so good slim and vulnerable and at time you were so hard... my god, your father please don't mucle yoursefl... from a french fan
14424	189	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I WANT TO KNOW HOW MAZE TRAINS, LESLIE ANN BRENDT
14425	190	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why does Tom Ellis and Lucifer’s personality match up hardcore
14426	191	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	If you use gloves during your workout, make sure they match your purse
14427	192	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	admit it, you're not here for the workout, you're here to see Tom Ellis workout and show off those delicious muscles
14428	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Literally the second he started talking my pants suddenly disappeared🙃
14429	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I went to a gym once and shot a guy when I first came in. I then proceeded to lift his corpse up multiple times. I call this deadlifting.
14430	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I thought dumbbell shoulder presses are considered being an isolated movement. Please correct me, if I'm wrong.
14431	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Im impressed he was able to do some excercies without assistance... i have never seen ANYONE getting assistance to do basic dumbell overhead before. Neither a assistance with such a intense look in his eyes meanwhile he helped with his assistance. I guess he did a god job to assist the work.
14432	197	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Omg I freaking love him!😂😍 one day I will act in a movie or show with him!!👍✌
14433	198	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	YOUR TRAINER SUCKS !!! WANT MUSCLE MASS COME TO MY GYM AND ILL SHOW YOU HOW TO TRAIN
14434	199	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Well I didn’t know I wanted it until now, but apparently I want an entire work out series by Tom Ellis. 🤷🏻‍♂️
14435	200	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	You: *Can barely do 4 pullups Internet Body Builders: 'Yea, just do 10 pullups, 4 sets'
14436	201	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I don’t know why I expected the accent to be different in real life
14437	202	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	When you decide to burn calories instead of burning bad people😂
14438	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	it's scary how hot he is when he's 40 years old by now SKSKSKS i mean he's not old but JEEZ
14439	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I kinda always imagined him wearing a suit when working out 😅
14440	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Well hello🥵
14441	206	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	no one: absolutely not a single soul: lucifer: HELLOOO DETECTIVEE
14442	207	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	he looks very young concidring he’s 40.
14443	208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This is literally the most basic beginner's workout routine that you see written either on an index card or on a white board in every goddamn gym in the whole wide world.
14444	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Finally a moviestar Not getting juiced up in 3 months to fit the role, Thanks alot! Edit: but god damn that bench was awful
14445	210	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	The heck? This is how he NORMALLY talks? Hahahahah lucifer was so natural hahaha
14446	211	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Its just a normal workout lol. I was expecting something insane
14447	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Good lucking guy but why does he keep saying he’s going heavy. 80kg bench, 3 pull ups & 18kg shoulder presses are not heavy.
14448	213	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I would recommend, when you're doing Oberhead Press. Don't hold your elbows too wide its Harder and you won't get injuries with your shoulder
14449	214	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	So this guy is just genetics.. This workout is basic, lucky guy
14450	215	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Calling BS on this one, workout makes no sense. 1st doing sprints as a warm up? Never seen anyone recommend high intensity cardio before lifting. Second what exactly is he working on? He’s doing chest, arms, back, and legs. Obviously the guy works out, would be interested in seeing his actual workout regimen, not this promotional video
14451	216	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	his upper body is good but i think maybe he should get his legs thiccer
14452	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	horrible form and no tension. don't think i'll take any advice from you bloke. Khali Muscle would laugh at you
14453	218	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Look & learn roid heads, even the devil wears gym gloves.
14454	219	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Everybody sees him as lucifer, and I see him as Gary from Miranda 😂
14455	220	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"I'm disappointed with you, you had an amazing opportunity to name the video "" train like the devil"" and you dropped it."
14456	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	When I satrted watching season 4, I immediately saw that he had trained
14457	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	His form isnt awful. Which honestly os what keeps most from the gym. bad form turns into pain.... With that being said. He is wearing gloves so all of this is invalid lol
14458	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Even the Lord of hell makes time to workout. What's your excuse?
14459	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	To make things simple. He is aiming for an Athlete body more than a Builder Body/Body Builder look.
14460	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Best feeling when you finally workout harder then a celebrity
14461	226	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I guess you can say.... It’s one *hell* of a workout
14462	227	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	6 reps 6 sets 6 times a week The devils workout What do you desire
14463	228	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Gloves to give smooth hand jobs
14464	229	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He has kind of a perfect body man, not too much, not too less.. 🔥
14465	230	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This guy makes me question my orientation.
14466	231	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why would squeeze the glutes whem bench pressing??
14467	232	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Crossing your legs whilst doing pull ups, lol
14468	233	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I always start my training with a glass of whiskey and a quick dip in the pool. It helps with the lazyness. After that im all good and lazy
14469	234	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why everything 4x10 should the compound be 4x6 or another low numbers? Im seriously asking
14470	235	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	People still act like training video are important, his diet is by far the most crucial factor in mantaining a good shape
14471	236	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I linke you. But your wirkout Routine sucks😅
14472	237	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I can't help but think he's actually in character working out.
14473	238	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Wait when did Lucifer come back to earth
14474	239	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	1:26 Ewwwww his spotter is touching the bar and the bar isn't even touching his chest Edit: 2:53 This is starting to trigger me
14475	240	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He is lean, extremely tall, sexy, fit and very handsome with cool personality. Some guys here commenting hate out of envy & stupidity! He clearly stated he wants lean muscles. He is a natural & damn it works so well on him! That water shots are to die for! 🔥
14476	241	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why would anyone care to train like this dude. Hes not even jacked
14477	242	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	“I like to start heavy at 40 pounds”
14478	243	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	That's why nobody likes the devil... he skips leg day !
14479	244	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He's on trt. Nothing against it. But he's got exogenous hormones in him.
14480	245	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	the way he got the dumbbells up for shoulder press.....wtf lol. what type of personal trainer is this guy smh
14481	246	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Probably the only actor who didn't use steroids!!
14482	247	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	well he is not a bodybuilder so stop complaining, he only train to be in good shape & woman like that, they dont like big guys...atleast not most of them
14483	248	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	That feeling when the personal trainer is silent and inanimate throughout, and the client's enthused and giving all the training advice... Raise your game, Paolo.
14484	249	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Db shoulder press? Compound movement?
14485	250	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Oh no, not the gloves🤦‍♂️
14486	251	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Lucifer is hot as hell.
14487	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Looked more muscular on the show, looks like he barely started working out, with the trainer lifting half the weight
14488	253	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	What am i missing? The guy looks great. But he’s not lifting that heavy. He struggled with pullups, 60kg on squat is about 150lbs, and 40lb per arm presses. I lift those numbers and his arms look much better
14489	254	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This guys knows how to work out better than the majority of people on the internet and at the gym. Finally someone who understand the fundamentals.
14490	255	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	WoW machito guys commenting this is not impressive bc they light 284o7123894237 pounds like wtf dudes we don't care about your workout routines we care about his. Either way, he wears gloves because it's safe, Paolo is with him bc IT'S SAFE. Gym routine is not about lifting a lot, screaming and getting your hands red or full of magnesium. Your comments are precisely why I hate to go to the gym. It is full of people that believe they have to be super big dudes like The Rock and are screaming and sweating a river and calling too much of attention. A routine should be adapted to you and what you want to achieve. The drawings and statues of angels from the renassaince and ancient greek are exactly what his physique looks like. Not too big, just shaped, good form. This is actually pretty accurate, he does not need more. And this shape will be easier to maintain. You are the same guys who critizise Jason Momoa when all that muscle is impossible to balance for all your life. Do your workout routines in peace and forget about others... Bodies are different... Goals are different... And its better to act safe in the gym that to injure your fucking self trying to look like a manly big man.
14491	256	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Sorry but I can't take any dude that wears gloves whilst training seriously...smh
14492	257	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Finally a good celebrity workout lol
14493	258	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"well mr devil if you want your ""guns"" to look big train triceps too"
14494	259	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	That was actually a really solid routine and not a bad video to model your workout after. Definitely did not expect that in a celebrity workout routine video.
14495	260	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He looks natty but all these guys are on roids or sarms
14496	261	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Ooohlala My eyes just had an orgasm 😈😅
14497	262	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Classic trainer touching and getting too involved to make you feel like you need them and keep paying for their service
14498	263	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	and it's time to see how Amenadiel works out
14499	264	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	60-70 kg on a barbell squat?? Mate... Wow i can lift 2.5 times more than the devil himself 🤣
14500	265	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Do the shoulder presses Standing.. Supersets are normally done with 2 opposing muscle groups. Like biceps and triceps. What he did is called a Giant set. 2 exercises back to back and no rest, for the same muscle group. Please work your triceps. Do Overhead extensions
14501	266	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He’s wearing gloves. 🤦🏻‍♂️
14502	267	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He said my name and it was like hearing a god or something calling me
14503	268	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	thank goodness the show got moved to Netflix. Naked Tom is the best Tom
14504	269	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Lol... I'd be dead after his warm up
14505	270	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I always wondered how he got soo big jk who is this again??
14506	271	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	You all do know that God and the devil is real right?
14507	272	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I gotta say, that was some pathetic weight he was struggling with. I hope he was faking it because Ive seen 120lbs teenagers moving more weight than that.
14508	273	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	the guy looks great but squats with only 60-80kg? really?.....
14509	274	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why is MH posting videos of a guy who clearly has no clue what he’s doing?
14510	275	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Workout ain't impressive, using the help of a trainer on overhead press shows he is weak.
14511	276	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Where are the guns 🤔💪💪
14512	277	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	the way he got those dumbbells up for the seated dumbbell press is literally giving me anxiety because that can get you injured.
14513	278	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	"""I put a heavy weight on there"" *Bench press 155 lbs with the trainer pulling the weight up*"
14514	279	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He's pretty small but in decent shape
14515	280	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Finally a good , no-bullshit workout from these series!
14516	281	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	okay, i have been baptized by how hot that coming out of the pool slow mo done by Tome Ellis 😏😍💋🔥
14517	282	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Why is the trainer toching the bar in The Bench press? And The arms in dB seated over head press? Otherwise it seams like good workouts, fokusing on form and not weight on the bar!
14518	283	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	oh so thats what hes doing in hell
14519	284	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Paolo! Hes the best devil trainer!
14520	285	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	OMG if the devil looks like that I'm surely going to hell!!
14521	286	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Suddenly all of men in the gym turned gay for him
14522	287	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	no way he can do 10 straight pull ups at the first set...
14523	288	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This is my goal body! More of an athletic look rather than the conventional big bulky bodybuilding look! Will definetly be implementing these exercises! Thanks for the great video!
14524	289	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I want him to crush me with his thighs 🤷🏼‍♀️
14525	290	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Season 5 better showcase all his hard work in the gym if you get my drift
14526	291	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He is so freaking sexy & tall!! 1.91 cm how that feels!! Perfect body measurements!
14527	292	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	He should be the next James Bond. 🤤🤤🤤🤤
14528	293	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	What exactly is a “rayjeem”.
14529	294	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Guess I need to start watching Lucifer... cause damn!
14530	295	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Tom Ellis can choke me with those big beautiful arms any day he wants to.
14531	296	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Aren't there any abdominal exercises? It would have been interesting because it is the most difficult result to achieve
14532	297	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This is a really great, practical exercise video! Also fun to look at, so to speak ;) Thanks for sharing!
14533	298	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	I'm glad I saw this video just before I go to bed 🍑💪🏼 Sweet dreams to come 🙈
14534	299	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Deeeteeeeectiiiiveeeee!?!?
14535	300	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Cardio before lifting? Hells naw
14536	301	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This video should be called train like the devil 💪
14537	302	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	This bozo is getting a spot on all of his lifts AND he’s wearing gloves! 🤦🏻‍♂️ 👎🤡👎
14538	303	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	20 minutes warm up on the treadmill is BS and a waste of time, you’re better off warming up 1/3rd of that time and with the same type of exercise that you’re going to do later in your workout, just warm up with lower weights/intensity.
14539	304	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F05fvnuF6iw	Seeing fancy and obscure equipment in some training videos is always cool, mostly from a novelty perspective, but I really dig it when people use classic lifts and focus on form. It's far more inspiring to the average person who's never lifted a weight in their life to know you don't need a crazy shoulder-press machine on multiple ball-bearing hinges to build a nice set of shoulders, and it shows that you don't need much to build a good physique or get into shape. Just the drive and discipline to get in and get it done. Kudos to Mr Ellis, and thanks to Men's Health for posting!

14542	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	0:57 He was 530lbs/240kg at his heaviest. He lost 270lbs/122kg over time. He is now 260lbs/117kg. That's insane. I'm happy to say I once lost 70lbs/31kg in the course of 5-6 months, but he topped it off by a long shot.
14543	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He is my inspiration. Aug 2019 weighed 365. With my new job as a city worker I drop down to 285. I'm currently 5'7, and goal is 200 or 180
14544	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	“Earl” “Yeah Randy” “I lost 250 FRICKING pounds” “Great,really good for you,so great”
14545	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Go ahead Tuna 👍🏻
14546	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	What a cool down-to-earth guy, you can tell he's humble in the way he speaks
14547	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He even sounds different as he’s lost all that weight.
14548	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Did he just said the only reason he has done all these efforts is for a girl ?
14549	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	His baby face is gone. He transformed from a grown-up Kid to a man. Inspiring.
14550	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	This sucks now he's just another fake fitness boy. All this bodybuilding shit sucks we hope that he see that sooner then later.
14551	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I don't understand: He's working out strenuously in a gym, but he's wearing a baseball cap. ( also backwards baseball caps still eludes me as to why folks do this)
14552	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	This guy could play Macho Man Randy Savage in a movie about his life
14553	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Super easy when you have a whole gym empty only for you and don't have to fight 20 guys for the equipment
14554	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Dude looks like a retired war vet, kudos to him.
14555	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Now he looks like a football player reshoot the movie lol.
14556	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Are we supposed to pretend this guy isn’t using roids?
14557	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	This is El's brother?????
14558	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	How did he remove all the skin ? I know when obese people lose all their fat they have leftover skin.
14559	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	No one gets veins like that doing exercises like that without gear. But good for him.
14560	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He's a bigger weight loss success story than Adele ever will be.
14561	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He forgot to bring up Boys Meet World!!!
14562	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Look at him pretending he wasn't in Boy Meets World 😂
14563	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Train like a celebrity means do steroids.. its not talked about and its lied about. Im not against steroid use its just these videos give out false hopes to those who are.
14564	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	For a guy this big, he’s not that strong
14565	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I can't get roids in New Zealand. Anyone saying this guy isn't on roids has zero clue
14566	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Even his face changed. Good for him, taking charge of his health.
14567	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	This is an amazing transformation. However, did he ever get to see the sailboat?
14568	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I'm huge and fat and feeling shitty. Day 1 today for me. Pray for me boys and girls <3
14569	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	His voice is trembling... hope he isn't jeopardizing his health for weight loss
14570	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I've been smoking cigs for almost a decade. If he can make such an impressive change I can too. I can't be smoking cigs in my 30's I just cant do it. So here's to you big homie if you can change I sure as hell can!
14571	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	With that amount of money and free time, it's nothing special.
14572	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I remember this dude from my name is earl, god damn that's crazy
14573	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He didn't just lose the weight, this man is jacked!
14574	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	It's pretty moving to see he doesn't have the attitude of his new body (yet ?). I wish him the best with his girl.
14575	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Wow I can’t even recognize him I saw him in the movie bad road trip 😂
14576	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Dude has acted in a ton of stuff, but I can’t imagine he’s able to just not work now. I wonder if he’s gonna try to go back to acting soon with his new body.
14577	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"All I can think is Randy finally got muscles. Haha. "" Oh yea, this buff guy looks like that fat guy from Mall Rats."" Haha"
14578	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	If I could spend all day in the gym with a trainer I'd look like that too
14579	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He's gonna start being the bad guy in movies now
14580	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	With his new physique his acting career should turn completely around. I can see him as a super heroe or villain for any of the comic movie franchises. Congrats big guy you are inspiring.
14581	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	damn i remember this guy from 90's-2000 movies, never even knew his name. He's probably the first person i ever saw who looks much better after getting older
14582	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"When your ""why"" is big enough, anything is possible!"
14583	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Incredible . I hope he hadn't lost jobs whilst being typecasted .
14584	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	And you too can look like this.... you just need a studio to let you quit your job, have no life....pay for your personal trainers and chefs.......and go workout twice a day............ it's that simple......... God is there is SINGLE person in that cesspool called hollowwood that ISN'T a lying POS?!?!?!?!?!?!?? or pedophile???
14585	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I saw him at a resturant in LA. He was unrecognizable.
14586	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Just saw him in “The Hunt” last week. I guess he got fat again
14587	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	“I met a girl who I felt was more important, than all the girls previous to her.” Yeah brother, it be like that sometimes.
14588	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Where did the excess skin go ? He does'nt take his shirt off in any of these Youtube videos. Congrats on the weight loss though !!
14589	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	American History X, stands out the most for me. And Boy meets World. It's hard losing weight. It's a mental and physical battle, straight war. Oh yeah and The Tuna from Blow, lol Proud of this man...
14590	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I've always thought Ethan Suplee was an underrated actor who never really got a fair chance because of his weight. Hopefully now that he's lean and mean hollywood will give him a more serious look.
14591	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	This is an inspiration. I'm 560. Had many ups and downs. A back injury. Depression. Loss of a social life. Loss of job. It's still doable. I will achieve it. It sucks that I have to do it alone it it must be done. I want to live and do things I can't do now.
14592	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Give this guy a show with seriously big guys trying to get healthy! Hes actually lived it, hed be a great motivator
14593	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He looks like a completely different person. His accent is the only thing that stayed the same.
14594	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	The woman who gave this man the time and chance to make such a huge change in life must be something special.
14595	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Wow he doesn’t even look like the same guy. Amazing how attractive someone can get once they lose weight
14596	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Earl: You know folks, it worked out pritty well for Randy in the end.
14597	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Sad thing tho, this probably hurts his career.
14598	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Oh man, when he mentioned doing it to be with his girlfriend a little longer, I teared up...
14599	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	1:10 I met a girl...me too man and I gained 20lbs, must be doing something wrong
14600	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He's just trying to be a better person.
14601	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	If it wasn't for his recognizable voice I'd never believe this was even him. I'm shocked.
14602	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	My god this guy is a legend. He had a bigger glow up than anyone I’ve ever seen, he transformed more than a paid Marvel superhero
14603	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He’s getting ready for the Remember the Titans sequel. Revenge of the Titans.
14604	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"Took me about 1 minute 10 secs and I was like....""oh yeah, it's him"" lol. But I am baked so..."
14605	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Even though he's lifting all these weights.. Rumor is he still can't see that sail boat
14606	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"Does anyone know how he can ""trick"" his muscle so that he doesn't lose a lot of muscle during the deficit?"
14607	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I'm not discount ing what this man has done but I feel it is so much easier to physically change your body when you have the money resources and time that these entertainer is a do. Normal people do not have that luxury. Once again not taking away from what he has done because this extraordinary but…
14608	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Wow steroids do work
14609	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	That could be me but I love Tacos😖
14610	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"""Train Like A Celebrity"" aka don't work for a living and have enough money to hire a daily-scheduled strength trainer, personal chef, and nutritionist who plan and curate your entire physical regiment and eating routine to perfection... see? anyone can do it"
14611	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	A woman should accept you for the way you are. Never change for a woman.
14612	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Imagine if Chris Farley had done this
14613	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Don’t forget he was one of the Head and Shoulders guys from Evolution
14614	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He's a scientologist, don't forget that
14615	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	In the army, extend to the left March! Is how we get the oxygen and blood flowing lol awesome work bud
14616	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He’s more inspirational than The Biggest Loser will ever be!
14617	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Most importantly he played Frankie Stecchino in Boy Meets World.
14618	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Shame that he’s a Scientologist
14619	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Damn, does anyone know if he had it surgically removed or if it was natural weight loss?
14620	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	People like us normal people can't afford fat surgery and he cant say he didnt have to
14621	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Being big like that and seeing him put in the work is heavy motivation!!! At my heaviest I was 420 I'm currently 380 and pushing. I'm never stopping after seeing this man put it in. Fck it I'm doing stomach and back today!!!!!!!
14622	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I was over 600 pounds now I'm down to 438 now I seem like I'm at a standstill and it sucks
14623	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I wish he talked about what he did to lose the weight initially. Cool that he's building muscle now, but I'd like to know how he lost the 250 lbs since that's where I'm starting from.
14624	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Did he play one of the bullies in Boy Meets World or am I thinking of someone else?
14625	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	When he said “My name is Earl” my heart literally dropped. Grew up with that show.
14626	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Thisyis so bad ass!! Deep respect, this is what should be virulized to transform humanity. Everything is surgery and covering up. We gotta explode and transform!! ❤️
14627	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I like how he's built like a tank now. But, still seems to have a mellow & friendly disposition!
14628	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Only a matter of time until Marvel snatches him up
14629	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Holy crap he's in his 40s? I'm so proud/inspired.
14630	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Glad to see he started taking his health seriously, didn't think he was going to be around for long. Again props to him for making that change.
14631	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I’m sure it’s easy when you have nothing but time and money to throw at fitness and physical trainers...
14632	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He looks like an older army ranger or delta force especially with the beard. He's doing a movie called The Hunt....
14633	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I never thought someone my size could get to that well looking! The cost of a trainer would break me.
14634	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	There's only so much muscle a person can put on in a short time without chemical help.
14635	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	What happens when you wear a cap backwards:
14636	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He is a great actor. I hope he doesn't lose his acting skills. Well done mate
14637	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Everyone is referencing Randy, does nobody have any love for Franky the Enforcer? Lol
14638	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Ultimately inspiring... this man deserves the utmost credit for this stunning transformation.
14639	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	testo4sure
14640	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Crazy that his arms are so freaking huge from muscle that you almost cant see his excess skin. I wonder what he looks like without a shirt. This is honestly very inspiring, and it motivates me!!
14641	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	This is the greatest transformation of somebody getting into shape I've ever seen.
14642	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Good for him, however; when you have trainers and Hollywood money I’m sure it’s much easier to achieve these results. A regular man/woman may not have transitioned so fast or at all.
14643	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	1.1k people can’t put down the hamburger.
14644	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He’s going to definitely be in the upcoming war movies.
14645	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	This is pretty phenomenal. I can’t believe that’s actually him!
14646	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	That's impressive, but he still hasn't seen the sailboat in that magic eye picture.
14647	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Poor guy has lose skin but he looks like Elias from WWE though. Maybe a lil surgery will get rid of that loosey goosey for that pum pum
14648	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I love him so much in every single one of his roles.... I so desperately wish he would get out of Scientology though 😢
14649	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I've always said it. You got the money, you can lose the weight. I'm poor by the way, so I may be bias...and fat.
14650	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Dosnt matter how many times I see this transformation, I'm still blown away every single time. Absolutely insane dosnt even look like the same man
14651	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Hes a mesomorph with endomorphic tendencies and a good actor, i hope he still gets movie parts
14652	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"whenever someone says ""it was invented by the soviets"" im all ears.. say what you want but since they didnt have capitalism, all their inventions had to make sense, not money."
14653	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"""What the hell, Randy!"" - Earl Hickey"
14654	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	The weight lost isent throwing me off ...its the beard , dident recognized him
14655	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Surely he’s had some sort of surgery aswell
14656	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	His high school bullies lockin’ their doors and peering through the blinds rn
14657	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	So if they break up he's gaining it back lol. Don't do things for other people.
14658	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Good shit right here!
14659	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Growing old, retaining muscle while losing fat, and intermediate+ lifts. You're on gear. Please be honest about that.
14660	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	So if she leaves him..hes back to pizza and donuts?..he needs to do this for himself..women are false motivation..but kudos for progress.
14661	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Looks like they found who could play Hercules in the next Thor movie.....
14662	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He was hot then, he's still hot now.
14663	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Okay, that was a push day for him, but can we get his diet? How many times a week is he working out? Cardio? Fasting? (not intermittent) We need to know more!
14664	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Personally, whatever his motivation was to do it, the fact that he lost enough weight to equal a large adult male, and that he’s keeping at it, to me, is inspirational. Just my opinion...🤷‍♂️
14665	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Damn, there goes my excuse for why I can't lose weight and get ripped at 35.
14666	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He looks great, but just like Kevin Smith, Jonah Hill, and others, I selfishly liked you better as the funny fat guy. Seriously, can you imagine if Chris Farley or John Candy got skinny? Not the same.
14667	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	BRING. BACK. MY NAME IS EARL. Jacked Randy, Earl is a chill skater again.
14668	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	“Train like a celebrity” except you have a full time job, don’t have millions in the bank (with royalty cheque’s flowing in) no world class trainer, no nutritionist, no access to a Hollywood private gym, no money for steroids and no personal assistant to manage everything while you sit your ass in the gym for 3-4 hours a day. Sounds like a piece of cake!
14669	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Wasn't he on Boy Meets World? He didnt mention that one.
14670	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Who says steroids dont work. Seem to be working perfect on this guy.
14671	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Imagine if he was in shape for American History X.
14672	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Looks like he could act in a military film.
14673	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He’s way older now but looks younger and better than 20 years ago!
14674	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	How does he get lean and build muscle ? It’s called HRT.
14675	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	It’s not a schooner, it’s a sailboat! But seriously, he’s always seemed like a good hearted person. It’s weird being happy for a stranger.
14676	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Randy Hickey: I'm gonna transform myself to be more appealing to my woman and live a good, long life together. Unhealthy woman: If you love me, you won't care how I look.
14677	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"""I just gave you momma a piggy back ride and she weighs twice as much as i do."""
14678	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Love Ethan Suplee ever since Mallrats. Glad to see he's taking care of himself to live a longer life. Wish I could say the same about myself.

14682	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Shame he's a filthy Scientologist. Imagine being in a cult in 2020.
14683	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He made one hell of a change he doesn't even look the same.
14684	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Seeing him right now makes me want to be a man.
14685	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Wait... you can't lose weight while gaining muscle you'll just gain more weight 🤨
14686	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Dude looks phenomenal. I remember this guy was in everything in the early 00's. Wasn't he the goth roommate in Butterfly Effect? What a crazy transformation.

14689	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	You can see how much loose skin he has on arms. Holy shit, its impressive, hats off.

14691	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	God I hope Ethan takes Hollywood by storm Chris Pratt style. He's such a powerful actor when he's in serious roles, and funny as hell in comedies.

14693	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He did this to get healthy and be around longer for the person he cares about. He’s never going to fail. Good job man!
14694	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He came out on the Ranch ! He looks amazing now.. Not that he didn’t before, he has a good sense of humor 😊

14698	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Yep money buys a lot. The average american does it thru starvation and typical excersize done consistently.
14699	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Omg, seriously it wasn’t until you spoke that I realized this was you. I though you were the trainer 😱 Tons of respect for the hard work and discipline you have!
14700	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Serious question here...what gear is he on? Not saying he hasn’t worked extremely hard to get that muscle, but he has to be on at least testosterone, no?
14701	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Thats how he should have looked in american history X.

14706	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Amazing..a trainer that actually had their client doing time tested effective old school bodybuilding exercises instead of all the bullshit in vogue crap today like standing on one leg while lifting, bosu balls, kettlebells..etc..
14707	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	This is years in the making this didn't happen overnight just know that years of dedication and hard work and sweat and blood not overnight
14708	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	It’s funny how huge guys like this always entourage you but in a real gym you’re made to feel unwelcome by all of the guys who are just starting to see some results.
14709	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	With those muscles, that beard, and his acting skills. Gears of War movie anyone?
14710	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	That’s impressive. Hard to lose that kind of weight when you’ve been carrying it around so long. Bet he enjoys life much more. Good for him.

14714	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I wanna know how to lose weight if one has two useless legs and sciatica, if I was healthy I don't think I'd be having trouble keeping myself around 100kg
14715	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I wanna see this guy on Joe Rogan podcast.
14716	174	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I am impressed by his weight lost, but I'm not interested in seeing him lift weights. I was expecting to hear him talk about the struggles during weight loss.
14717	175	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Still comes off as a kind sweet guy. He just looks scary, and I mean that in the best way possible. Congrats to you.
14718	176	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	*_I hope the woman you basically did all this for appreciates the work you've done._* *_Keep up the great work on yourself!_*

14721	179	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He did this without being on a show and making money to lose weight, he'll probably stick with it
14722	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	is that the fat idiot that let loose that train in Denzel Washington movie?
14723	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"His wife probably looks at him & thinks "" oooo yum."""
14724	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	The Incredible Bulk has transformed into THE INCREDIBLE HULK!
14725	183	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"I was watching American History X recently and was thinking ""Damn, he's so unhealthy, I hope he's at least not dead."" Hell yes, dude"
14726	184	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	To be honest, I actually thought that he passed some time ago since I didn't hear anything from him. It is so great to see, that the only thing that passed was his overweight and he totally transformed to a healthy, strong person. Very inspiring!
14727	185	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Not a single comment here about remembering him as Frankie Stecchino from Boy Meets World. I even 2nd guessed myself and made sure it was him.
14728	186	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	No lie this truly just motivated me to get back in the gym hard body. I truly have major respect for this man for realizing that the importance of change. ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
14729	187	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"""pre activated""? Sounds like one of those bro-science-buzz-words like ""muscle confusion"". But hey, if it works, call it whatever you want"
14730	188	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	“I’m the fat guy from My Name Is Earl.” Me: *impossible*
14731	189	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	U forgot American history X the best movie ever but they say bad words so can’t talk about that lol. This is bizarre though because he doesn’t look unique anymore. He’s just another jacked dude.
14732	190	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"""Remember that guy you thought was too stupid and had no drive to do anything with his life, well look at me now!! My name is Randy"" a long way from where you were, awesome job getting healthy"
14733	191	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	This man straight up made turned himself into old Kratos.
14734	192	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Who is putting a dislike on this video? Really? This is fantastic, I'm extremely happy for him. Two thumbs up!
14735	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Curious what kind of movie roles he's gonna get now or will he ever... now?
14736	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"BRING BACK MY NAME IS EARL. ""Damn it Randy"""
14737	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Until I heard his voice I didn't believe it was actually him.
14738	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"I'm very Happy for Ethan. And very sad the Cancelled ”Chance” , I would have loved to see this version of ""D"". He's looking healthy and Awesome. 😋"
14739	197	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I hope he gets back into acting... And put him in a movie about rangerbat or delta
14740	198	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	It almost feels like anyone who's lost a tonne of weight AND gained muscle is more impressive than those who were just 'average' body types before turning muscular. Like, instead of starting at 0%, guys like Ethan start at -75%. Incredible.
14741	199	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He should be doing it for himself not a women.
14742	200	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Bro I’m glad I was friends with him.
14743	201	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He looks better than most Hollywood pretty boys, you’d never realise he used to be seriously overweight. Well done.
14744	202	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Everyone naming movies he was in but am I the only one that remembers him as part of Harleys crew on Boy Meets World
14745	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Just shows you, there is a way back, even if you are the size of a rhino
14746	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Never underestimate the power of the pussy...
14747	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I always like him as an actor. Thought he was talented and I hated to see him so big because I felt he would die young but when I seen him in Wolf of wall Street I was happy to see him change his life around and couldn't believe that was him. Keep up the great work.
14748	206	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	It’s wrong of Men’s Health to promote cheaters.
14749	207	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Too bad he became a crazy scientology cultist.
14750	208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	"My buddy came to me at 500 lbs. He needed help losing weight and wanted to be an mma fighter. So I agreed to help him. He was doing splits at 350 pounds. After a year of training we went our separate ways. He kept training, and over all made it down to 190 lbs. Very proud of him and the determination he had to be a better person. He is 5'6"""
14751	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Maybe now he’ll get to see that sailboat everyone’s been talking about!
14752	210	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I can't believe that's the same guy. This should be an inspiration for anyone who wants to lose weight.
14753	211	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I'm surprised he didn't mention Boy Meets World.
14754	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	As jacked as he is, her sure nuff was shaking with those 50 dumbbells
14755	213	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He looks kind of like Macho Man Randy Savage back in the day.
14756	214	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I can't believe he didn't mention The Butterfly Effect, that role was badass. I'm so happy for him.
14757	215	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Absolut stunning, would not recognise him if he stood next to me
14758	216	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	He was cute as a fat guy but he's even more handsome now.
14759	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I wonder if after losing all that fat he has any lose skin
14760	218	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Pretty easy when you have a ton of money and time. Congrats to him tho he definitely put in work. I’m just saying he has the time and money unlike you or I

14762	220	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Worst part for him will be all that excess skin, I hope he end up in a marvel movie! Great motivation!
14763	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	You look like a different person entirely, if they ever make another Expendables movie, I hope you're in it.
14764	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Must be nice having money and hiring a private coach to train u
14765	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I haven’t heard anything about this guy for years, awesome to see he’s doing so well and living healthy and so well! 👍
14766	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	I can’t hear a damn thing he’s saying because your royalty free music is WAY too loud
14767	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Damn. He turned into Kratos. Was waiting for him to say, “Read it Boy!”
14768	226	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJz_KNgXLw	Damn, this was the motivation I needed to see. I am currently sitting at 400 pounds. 9 years ago I was 210.
14769	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	I wish he asked him how he thought one could get big without eating meat.
14770	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Salmonella isn't in the egg, it's on the shell
14771	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	He’s a pos liberal
14772	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Shills veganism but eats eggs and steak 🤦
14773	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Why did all my childhood heros have to turn into freedom hating socialist morons
14774	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	He cut out all the sugar products... opens the fridge and we see orange juice which is loaded with sugar. 4:11
14775	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	So he stays away from meats. And his favourite food is cooking beef. What an oxymoron
14776	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	I don't like Arnold anymore because he's a backstabbing RINO. Hate to get political but the country is dying because of people who think like he does.
14777	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	I love this man, I'm afraid legends like him one day will be gone. I'm gonna cry so hard
14778	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	8:28 The first bodybuilder who also was a snowman. That is truly inspiring.
14779	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Plant based but still smokes Cigars? This is an example of why I have the utmost respect for this man and his work ethic/achievements but would never look to him for advice on health. Ever!!!!!!
14780	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	F$$k your fridge Arnold...
14781	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	What a savage, the whole egg even the shell 😆
14782	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Spoken like a true politician - Does the complete opposite of what he says.
14783	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Screw you fridge. And your gym.

14786	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Whole egg in without boiling at least first: level of Salmonella 100/100 unlocked.
14787	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	When I see bodybuilders try give advice all I see is steroids. Like bro, talk about the roids.
14788	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	1:20 This did not age well.
14789	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Screw Arnold.
14790	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	The greatest not because of his achievements but because of his HUGE personality and spirit.
14791	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	I've been looking in the stores and can't find Arnold milk.
14792	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Arnold said tequila I thought he was meant to serve and protect? 😁
14793	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	"""I like to put in THE WHOLE EGG"""
14794	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	I’m as u can see 👀 shitfaced
14795	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Imagine that Arnold. Having freedom to choose what to eat and how to work out. Screw your freedom doesn't sound so good now does it?
14796	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Screw Arnold and his fridge!!!
14797	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	This guy is known to give people bad advice he even admits it. I wouldn't trust him
14798	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	No longer care for Arnold.
14799	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Screw your gym and fridge!
14800	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	He started taking steroids at 15, a great example of men's health. Heart problems by 50.
14801	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	screw your fridge
14802	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Screw your gym and fridge!
14803	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Arnold is a traitor . F him and HIS freedoms, per his quote of him saying F our freedoms, hence Recon pulling hundreds of thousands of dollars from anything related to the Arnold classic
14804	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Damn he looks great and young
14805	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Is that the same man and said that you need to have the injection
14806	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Let's look in Arnold's fridge... Shows us his office fridge. You know the dude probably has a walk in fridge at home.
14807	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	That’s interesting he’s rich with a gym at his home but rather go to a busy one 😂
14808	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Imagine just going to the gym, and not realizing a living legend is working out next to you.
14809	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	i was waiting to see more Dumbells inside the fridge.
14810	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	7:24 Kid next to Arnold looks like the uni-bomber
14811	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	He's always trolling, love it. His humour will be wasted on so many people.
14812	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	There’s no way not to love this guy. He’s all around an awesome human being an hilarious, lol.
14813	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Suprised how clueless he is. He claims to cut out all sugars and he blends a whole banana right down to pure sugar.
14814	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Considering your heart it needs the product nature's claim you will benefit from this I care about you and only hope you cheek it out
14815	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Did this man just eat a whole egg WITH the shell and nobody is talking about it???
14816	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	It’s literally impossible to hate Arnold, and that’s a fact
14817	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Arnold : Come with me if you want to live 💪😎😂
14818	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Love how he stocked his fridge before the visit. I'm sure hosnfridge before the show only had mustard, mt dew and eggs
14819	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	That's the lesson, cut down or eliminate the meat, don't end up with heart surgery like Arnie here.
14820	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	I’m glad he was being honest, when asked about supplements and that he emphasized the importance of food rather than supplemental placebos
14821	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	I want to see his actual every workout second for second and diet when he was in Bodybuilding competitions
14822	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Arnold is such a standup guy🙌🏼✅👏🏽
14823	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	"Arnold takes the ""whole egg"" to another level"

I want to understand the motives behind someone’s reasoning for disliking a video showing exactly what it says in the title. It is jealousy? is it boredom? Are they trying to get specific videos out of their YouTube page algorithm? I want answers...

But actually I can’t drink really very much anyways because I just be an alcoholic and I did a lot of damage my used to my liver and it hasn’t been quite seven years yet so it’s still healing so I got to take it easy when it comes to the sauce.

14959	190	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Beef and eggs built his body in his prime, barely no carbs except on cheat day. All Golden Era bodybuilders did that. I think he was joking around in this video.
14960	191	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	2:48 lmao
14961	192	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Normal people: Eating boiled eggs Bodybuilders : Eating raw eggs Arnold: Eating whole eggs
14962	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	"""You hit like a vegetarian"" and now look he's one of them."
14963	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	6:35 check out the form of the guy with the green top in the back 😅
14964	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	keto, a fad diet? LUL that interviewer needs to do some reading.
14965	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	When you invest hundreds of millions into vegan industry (proteins and so), .... Business first. I have no doubt he has another fridge in basement he did not show in video that he actually still uses. :-)
14966	197	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	When he was world champion he ate low carb. Steaks, Hamburger patties without the bun, Eggs, Milk. And now some how he thinks that fruits and veggies are healthy? Vegans are sick all the time. Eat Meat and be healthy.
14967	198	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Arnold just a little bit of almond milk puts the whole bottle
14968	199	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	"""When you're young, you get away with a lot of things."" Ohhhh, so true. You won't learn that or believe it, till you've been in shape, and then get old."

14970	201	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	He put the whole damned egg in the shake... ?
14971	202	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	So he drinks nut juice, aka almond water, which is not a naturally occurring food but hates cows milk. Sounds a little twisted. You should avoid conventional milk, but raw cow milk from a healthy grass fed and finished cow is liquid gold. Wonderful for your health.
14972	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Age really catches you up, after all the beauty and power goes away from where it came from, 😔
14973	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	STEROIDS!! he rarely talks about the STEROIDS he took! He has admitted to taking them. You have to take them to get as big as he was. The major side effect was the increased muscle mass which was abnormal and therefore his first heart could not handle the extra muscle mass.
14974	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	"Hay guys, one question. At 8:15 what he means with ""Cut""? Is like to a slang, meaning ""Smart""? Thanks for the help🙃😅"
14975	206	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	It makes no difference because the muscle doesn't know what you're holding in your hands! _A true hardcore bodybuilder only can say that..no jing bangs..just business!_

14986	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	The muscle don’t see what your holding in your hands! Legend.

15023	254	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Just think about this, Arnold is such a badass he doesnt just drink raw egg (which most people avoid like the black death), he blends the entire egg just for the extra calcium
15024	255	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	wait did he just nutribullet an egg with the shell? wtf

15030	261	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Arnold still has his accent, and it makes me wonder if he even knows much German still? Most people think in their native language, but considering he’s never slipped, and we’ve never really seen him speak it, I imagine he thinks in English without the need for translation.
15031	262	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	I love Arnold but this man has probably never said one true sentence in his life

15033	264	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	He lost a lot of weight, not ripped anymore. The vegan diet probably isn't doing him any favors. But no sugar and no bread is a good look
15034	265	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	This man is 72 years old but he looks like he is in his mid 50s

15104	335	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Arnold looks good at any age, and he’s an inspiration.
15105	336	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	He should have answered the door saying “what”? When the person replied, he should have said “who are you”?

15121	352	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	It is really a mystery for me how, after so many years in the US, he can still have this strong austrian accent :-)
15122	353	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Arnold has said that he loves to give people the wrong advices....
15123	354	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	He's looking more pale and drained than ever, don't think his kidneys and liver are getting all the correct hormone building materials he needs from proper cholesterol consumption

15144	375	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	The secret to Arnold’s appeal is that he is an authentic arrogant badass but so likable.
15145	376	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Isn’t an egg put into the carton by hand or machine?? So wouldn’t it be dirty?
15146	377	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	After all these years he still has that Accent
15147	378	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Arnold is really an inspiration not only due to his achievements, but also due to his humbleness

15164	395	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFk-L7Wcg0g	Lol, you ate meat when you were young. This is just propaganda cause you dont dare to be judged in socialmedia. Scared of loosing celeberty status. Shure you are old now and need less redmeat, but to tell ppl meat is bad is propaganda from lefties...

15176	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Sorry but he’s not actually that big ,he’s just bigger in this film than others
15177	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	For all those thinking that he actually packed mass with *these* exercises- no, no he didn’t
15178	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	What about Legs - we don’t do that here
15179	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Fluffy light shit How about one of these celebrity trainer fucks recommends something worthwhile like some heavy compounds and progressive overload
15180	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Also: Take steroids
15181	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	What the fuck is this nonsense? Just proves when your on a little bit of gear, it really doesn't matter how you train.

15184	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	I like this trainer, I like his calm and clear way of explaining things
15185	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Guys.. if you are trying to put on muscle.. these exercises are BS. What you need is progressive overload for squat, dead lift, pull ups, bench press, military press. That’s about it.
15186	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	The actor who played the beast stated that he picked up a 5x5 powerlifting routine to pack on the muscle

15189	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Lat pulldown over pull ups? Weird flashy row variation instead of barbell or dumbbell rows? Seems like odd exercise choices for putting on muscle as quickly an efficiently as possible.
15190	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	This muscle mass in 3 months. My friend has one question, what roids was he taking?
15191	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	At my gym I did that Lizard Crawl & everyone thought I was possessed... They didn't have any Holy Water but they threw their protein powder at me..

15196	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Ironically, he said this workout is for mass, yet there are no big compound movements, no pull ups, no deadlifts. I call bs on this dude as a trainer.
15197	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	please tell me more about I can get huge by doing 4 exercises for 4 sets of 10 then moving like the girl from the ring for 3 months.

15201	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	He was on steroids, it’s a fact. The male human can only gain 20 percent of muscle naturally and that 20 percent of muscle gain takes years Upton years. It’s a scientific fact.
15202	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	we had about 3 months---> roids
15203	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	If he did full body , coumpound movements, he would have came out with better progress. His progress wasnt that great

15207	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Lizard crawl looked cool, will try at home. But seriously 2x/week and you'll get jacked in 3 mos??? I think you forgot the vitamin T maneuver .
15208	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Lizard crawl - that’s how I leave most pubs.

15213	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Pretty sure he used sarms or steroids

15218	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	None of these are mass building whats his stack? Probably the only thing i would recommend is the lizard dance. Just to summon the gains gods
15219	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	hard tren and a good diet, there are no excuses *ops I meant hard training of course ...
15220	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	"""We only had two months, and we got him to gain 25 pounds of muscle!"" Yeah and what PED's were used to achieve that?"
15221	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Dude, your technique instructions and knowledge of functional movement and activated muscles is limited and poor. and sometimes false. You are a hack... Watch AtheleneX videos, he knows what hes talking about.
15222	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	so he just worked out his back for 3-4 months? okay, cool...
15223	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Its funny how the muscles that respond best to steroids, delts and traps, grew the most on Mcavoy. And 3 months huh? Sounds like a natural transformation for him.
15224	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	The Lizard walk reminds of the time I sniffed 6 grams of ketamine..
15225	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Celebrity trainers come up with the most outrageous exercises to do. In order to get The actor/actress ready for their movie role in a few months. Celebs gotta go on a strict diet and gain muscle. I’m fine with the basics. Squat, deadlift, bench press, burpees and running. 😂 I got no time to be crawling like a lizard😂😂😂😂
15226	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	"""We didnt have much time...we had three months to pack as much muscle mass as possible"". ^That's the best line for making beginners fall into buying his program."

15228	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	I would probably be shot by NYPD trying to do that outdoor
15229	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Lizard Walk is dope AF. Also, it looks like you're having a stroke.
15230	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	1:35 the hell is wrong with that leg
15231	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	I get that James' back was impressive, but this training was almost all back exercises. And McAvoy has shoulders, chest arms and also legs popping out like damn man, his physique was complete and I didn't see any lack in any part of his body.
15232	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Specific exercises aside, how much muscle mass did he gain in 3 months? Exercise is one component to #GAINZ, so it would be better to know how his exercise routine fit into diet regimen.
15233	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	I did that crawling thing in gym, and everyone was staring at me as if I'm mentally challenged😂😂

And tell me he did this workout routine two days a week that's 24 sessions granted other stuff can be thrown in there. However this doesn't explain it, they had to have given him steroids. Edit: Movie stars often take steroids and other enhancement drugs to look like gods take this video with a very big grain of salt. Real motherfsss know it takes much longer to make those kinds of gains.
15239	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	10 reps 4 sets.. ok understood but how abt the weights? Same weights for all the 4 sets??
15240	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	2º exercise is pure BS, sorry
15241	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	trash isolation exercises don't build muscles FAM...it's all compound movements! Military press,squats,deadlift,bench press & bent over rows...in this actor's case I believe functional workouts with weights,calisthenics and compound movements gave him that body...
15242	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	Ill show you a real life BEAST!!!!
15243	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdopQDjNOaE	That crawl thing....umm wut,like,how do I make my leg do that

15248	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	When I deadlift it feels like my eyes are popping out
15249	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Thanks 🙏 I just did a 190 deadlift with good form
15250	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	you guys skip leg days a lot I think
15251	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I did deadlifts for the first time yesterday, and I feel soreness in my lower back more than anything. I'm almost positive I did them wrong, I will not stop until I achieve perfect form.
15252	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Great question; I had abdominal hernia repaired years ago. Still have a little weakness in core. What are the chances of blowing a hernia out even when flexing your core doing deadlifts?
15253	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	is 225 at 15 good?
15254	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I wish I could be able to deadlift
15255	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I just had someone come up to me at the gym trying to correct my form which was already embarrassing. Realized from this video I’ve been doing it wrong this entire time 💀
15256	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	i know it sounds dumb but no matter how much i watch tutorials i always feel it in my lower back
15257	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I tend to bend my back
15258	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Bar always be hitting my knees on the way down
15259	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	POV: You just realised how trash your form actually was
15260	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Watch 1:35 on 0,25 speed repeatedly
15261	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I always feel like I'm still using a little bit of my lower back as I stand, even when I'm set like he is
15262	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I feel pretty happy with myself deadlifting 300 @ 14 yrs and I've been told my form is good, but I came here to further improve it. I didn't know about locking your shoulders... Thanks for your pointers 👍
15263	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Im amazed that I can still even walk given how wrong I've been doing dead lifts...
15264	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	At 53, I’ve been training for 6 months now and just found a barbell and some plates to start deadlifting, so thanks for setting me straight so early, as I already have disc degeneration issues of which to be mindful.
15265	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Ok but is it permitable to lock your knees straight or should that be avoided in favor of keeping a slight bend in the knees at the top?
15266	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	There this guy in my gym who had horrible form his back was more curved than the curvature of the earth
15267	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Just did a deadlift this morning and i cant even bend down 🥺
15268	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	1. Toes 2. Overhand grip 3. Hips lower than shoulders 4. Set lats 5. Core involved 6. Lift 7. Squeeze glutes
15269	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Hey guys great video! I'm stuck with 100 kgs on deadlift for a month...what should I do? I checked my form and I found that I was crouching a lot more than what you've shown, so after adjusting that I can feel my back getting involved a lot more and the weight is more uniformly distributed now...but still can't get through that 100...
15270	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	As a teacher I'd love to use these videos to help demonstrate movements but I can't use it in school with foul language. Just thought I'd share.
15271	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I wish i could be able to deadlift, my form is perfect and even though i use light weights i still always feel everything in my lower back. I talked to many experts and showed them my form and they all don’t know why i only feel my lower back being used
15272	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Is deadlift for back or legs?
15273	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Thank you very much, really. I've always tried to deadlift and always stopped due to strange sensations in my lower back. Most of the video focus on bad form and fill time with not usefull informations. For the first time, almost 6 years after the first time i've tried the deadlift, i felt nothing in my lower back. I can now progress !! There is nothing I've never eard or seen in this video but you just gave usefull informations and did not focus on bad form or whatever that could distract me, only the most important things.m were told. Pardon my aproximate english. Thanks again.
15274	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I always avoided this exercise because I was afraid of having bad form in front of people, it’s safe to say that I’m practicing this in an empty gym 😂
15275	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I did my first deadlift after this video earlier this year and just hit 385 in a few months. This exercise goes from scary to fun. Once you get comfy with the positioning the numbers really shoot up fast.
15276	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I would deadlift, but I heard it causes cancer so I avoided it.
15277	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	How heavy are those weights in kilograms?
15278	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I find it funny that this channel is called “Mens Health” when women could lift just as much. How sexist LOL!
15279	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I just did a 265/120kg deadlift weighing 144lb/65kg as a beginner. Pretty proud...now I need to work on my bench and squats lol
15280	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I was deadlifting yesterday, 1 dude told me that im young and i'll have problems later, abother 1 told me to use a belt or i'll cry in the hospital in a coupleof years, another one told me to use mix grip and not leave the bar on the ground on the ground every rep.... i'm dissapointed and i don't want to do deadlifts anymore
15281	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Ehm im 14 and dead lifted 110kg today but after it i have had alittle pain in the back, should i be worried. my weight is 54kg btw.
15282	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Ive been taught to lift with your legs first then hinge yourself up with your back no?
15283	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	The engaging lats part is the piece of the puzzle I've been missing holy crap. Thank you! I knew I was doing it wrong but couldn't quite feel what it was naturally.
15284	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	His butt needs to go down a lot more. He also needs to be looking up at the ceiling with every lift. His spine won't be vertical but it needs to be damn near close. Do whatever weight necessary to maintain that form. Form, whatever the exercise, is paramount above all else.
15285	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I have a question that is off topic, so i was at work the other day n there was this steel bar that weighed around 100 kg and i was able to lift it so does that mean i can deadlift 100 kg? If anyone could answer my question that would be nice.
15286	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Watching this because my lower back really hurts right now after deadlifting in the morning. Damn.
15287	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	A variation called the straight legged deadlift is done with the hips a little higher. It's more of a glute and hamstring exercise.
15288	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I did deaflift, all I remembered is everything going black.
15289	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Thanks for using real weights and not tell us you’re a physical therapist
15290	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Quarantine made me lose my deadlift form
15291	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Don't use belts? Why do most professional dead lifters use it? Doesn't it contribute to spinal stability and reduce the risk of injury?
15292	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	This helped a lot I was lifting with my lower bacc and I threw my bacc out
15293	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	My question would be what about newbies who dont have a 45lb plate on both sides? Smaller plate means the bar is closer to the floor which for me as a tall person is next to impossible to reach that low with a flat back. Anything I'm missing?
15294	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I don't think it's a good idea to start heavy with this lift. Don't even think about it because you will risk injuring yourself. Perfect your form first.
15295	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Thanks man very helpful, after deadlifts my lower back hurts. Now after this video my hamstrings are sore and it's a amazing feeling. Hope I'm doing it right.
15296	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Thank you for the short and direct video. People love to go on and on about irrelevant stuff or continue to talk in circles to make that 10+ minute video rather than straight and to the point tutorials.
15297	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	My weights allow my barbell to come off the ground by 4.5 inches, should I put plates underneath it to make it higher because I think it should be
15298	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	i see people making 12 minute videos, these guys just get straight to the point 🔥
15299	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I always get a burning almost ripping sensation in my lower stomach upper groin area? What’s that from?
15300	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Not messing with this exercise ever again I messed up my left butt muscle sciatic nerve and the pain ran to the bottom of my foot for months. Not worth the risk.
15301	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	How much time you supposed to wait between sets?
15302	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I don't go gym and I don't have weights at home so I deadlift my own bed that weighs I'd say a good 30kgs if I want more weight on it put my blanket and whatever on-top
15303	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	One important key tip. You push with your heels! This is a mainly leg exercise
15304	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Well I sure wanna look like a badass in the gym! Lunk Alarm won’t know what hit it!
15305	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Lose the music. It is annoying.
15306	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	This helps greatly, thanks. I'm brand new and I caught most of the tips from other videos but you gave key things I can improve: I noticed I was thrusting out a bit at the top. I'll stop. It's possible my hips aren't low enough at the start. I fixed that. I was doing 114 lb to start: some weight but fixing form first.
15307	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I’m embarrassed now lol. I was doing deadlifts the other day and my form was trash. Ugh love working out but getting form down is difficult
15308	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Always videos with light weight🙄🙄🙄🙄
15309	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	75% of the video was talking about pre deadlift form. 1% was the actual deadlift and 24% was about not over extending at the end.
15310	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	"""Hey Brett, go ahead and do that unhealthy lifting practice they shouldn't do."""
15311	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	Thank you, my poor form was making my lower back hurt. This helped a lot.
15312	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	In my opinion if you're doing a decent weight for you and the barbell isn't killing your shins... Your probably not doing it right
15313	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	That dude needs to hit the juice.. hes only lifting 95 and looks like that's max
15314	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	He skips the steps about deadlifting
15315	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I dont trust anyone deadlifting in sneakers tbh
15316	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MzxtBKyNE	I always scared to do deadlift, I will give it a go now. Cheers

15330	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAZobMyRy8o	No shade but I'm just wondering if he has joint pain from his size? As I watch him walk, it's kinda the same as people dealing with obesity or pregnant with the form, it's not exactly straight. I hope he doesn't but watching him walk caused me to feel concern for him.

15411	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	What... he put the whole egg 😂😂🥴🥴😮😮😮😮😮
15412	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Does he really include the whole raw egg? Or was that a joke?
15413	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	I wonder how many people actually put whole eggs in their shakes after seeing this. Or Schnaps 😁👍
15414	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	That counter top is a mess. Where is the housekeeper?!
15415	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Can someone actually try this and let me know how it tastes
15416	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	In the video it said cherry juice, but I think he was actually putting in concentrate, not regular juice. Can anyone confirm?
15417	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Man he puts de hooooole egg, dats hard core! imma try the same
15418	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	"In ""The End of Days"" he put also a cigarette into a power shake 😅"
15419	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	My smoothies are much better. I should start showing people how to make healthy high calorie and high protein meals.
15420	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	I heard this man is an alien, that's why he got success so easily and that perfect body.
15421	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Been my new protein shake for past 2 weeks
15422	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	When he throws in the whole egg with the shell, I can’t tell if he’s joking or not. Lol
15423	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	He's 1000% spot on about micro-managing and over-thinking everything to the nth degree. Just fuckin' do the work.
15424	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	"Why is Arnold saying, ""here we go with the protein"" when the package has a green stripe and plainly reads, ""greens"" and is a green herbal substance? Because it's not protein, it's greens. Which all means this.... Arnold doesn't know what he's putting into his own drink because he's sponsored by Ladder and he doesn't even drink Ladder products. That's why he has no idea that Ladder wanted him to up-sell Ladder Greens in this video and NOT Ladder Protein. Pretty shameful when you find out how bad reality is and marketing. If Arnold were actually using the product, the green package and green powder would have been blatantly obvious."
15425	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Notice how Arnold didn’t really acknowledge what type of protein he is taking. Well that’s because in the golden days there was no such thing as Ladder or any type of protein like today. Old school body builders had other ways.
15426	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Gym trainers: look the lesson today in the workouts are gonna be... Arnold: hey, just shut up and do it
15427	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	What is the protein pack brand that he is using?
15428	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Plot twist: he put the whole egg cuz he could'nt broke the egg

15430	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Hey Arnold! Is it true that too much calories makes you fat? I have seen other protein shake over than 1200 cal.
15431	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Mmm cholesterol.

15435	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	He’s on point in the end . Especially with powerlifting how we tend to avoid think stuff. I just got to the point it’s 11pm or its 3am just do the workout . Don’t complain .
15436	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	I was doing the whole egg thing wrong all these years... Thanks for enlightening me ARNALOD.
15437	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Love that he says not to overthink, cause that’s what we are all guilty off and we shouldn’t. Arnold’s the man
15438	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	“DONT WORRY!!!! THIS WAS FILMED BEFORE COVID 19!!!!” I laughed.

15455	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	I thought he was trolling when he dumped the entire whole egg in there. And the next second it got blended

15459	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4c3e3zZ8kU	Arnold is the original troll, i bet he doesn't really put a whole egg in his shakes.

15491	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Damn if he trained like this years ago he’d still be in beast mode for the Yankees!!
15492	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Ehh...why you ain't did that when pitching for the Yankees?
15493	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Man’s is 40 years old and lost 60+ lbs. Who cares if he’s on the sauce?

15495	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	to all the folks talking about roids. dude just spoke about the heart problems in his family. Folks of African decent, especially from west Africa which is where most our ancestors came from. we can get like this easy. the dude was already big, which means carrying around that weight did help build muscle. he shedded and then got ripped. if you have a personal trainer and a nutritionist with the money he has. you can get this with over the counter supplements. highly unlikely he uses roids, the man is trying to escape heart problems not create. ok hater.
15496	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Veggies no meat high reps changed my life so great job Cardio daily walking And Bike work

15519	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Where was this commitment to fitness when he was actually a professional athlete? Good for him but he definitely did this backwards.
15520	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Trust me he’s not on anything... he put in the work.
15521	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	He lost a lot of weight but this can't be just from lifting. What was the cardio or eating changes
15522	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Bro just imagine if he was in shape like this during his career he's already a all time great but man he definitely would have added to his accolades in baseball for sure🏆🏆🏆

15528	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	He’s clearly not natural but you have to give him credit for the transformation, no easy feat enhanced or not

15530	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	He would of lasted longer if he worked out during his playing days.

15538	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Bro his shoulders are insane. Definitely not natty tho, which is concerning since he says he’s worried about hypertension and other health problems…trading food for steroids isn’t necessarily the best idea…
15539	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Super proud of CC, Imagine if he would've done this transformation while still playing in the league.
15540	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Whether he’s using something or not, he still has to put in the work! 💪🏼
15541	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	62 lbs for someone that tall and converting prob just as much weight to muscle is very impressive. It’s not easy. Great job CC now come back and help the Yankees 😂

15543	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	No way he's natty and got shredded and bulky up at that age lmao
15544	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	I better he could still play in the MLB if he wanted to now since he's in better shape than when he was in the MLB.
15545	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	If he’s full natty I’ll eat my hat.
15546	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z88o0dmhh7Q	Can you imagine had he done this while playing MLB

15572	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	This particular episode of ASAPScience seemed quite boring and unappealing to me. Then I realized there was no background music.

15575	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	Iam personally a powerlifter but I know from personal experience and my PTs that flexing for a strength exercises is pointless, if u are involved in heavy athletics bodybuilding powerlifting strongman etc u dont need to stretch before work out/competition as it will not improve your strength performance. Thou this is legit for light athletes runners etc.

15578	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	1. yes and i know why because when i was lifting weights and doing cardio 7 days a week in high school i was stiff as hell and slow in punches and kicks 2. now i stretch 2 hours a day and work out a lot at the gym when i have the time but recently i havent been stretching because of college but i am taking a yoga class which we stretch for 2 hours so i make up for it and my punches and kicks have vastly increased in speed because of my gym routine 3. but recently for the past 6 months going on 7 months i have been doing push ups and squats at high, medium, and low positions and am still very flexible even though i only stretch for 2 days out of the week instead of 7 days 4. i cant wait until i have the time to do my gym routine again 5. BRUCE LEE is the perfect example of what stretching can do who is also my fitness goal

15580	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	I'm calling this guy out as part of the illuminati, stretching has been proven for centuries to relieve stress among other before/after work out benefits.

15589	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	warming up but its the winter olympics
15590	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	Well there are more than one types of stretching, two that I know of. Static stretching is what this video is talking about where you are stretching a muscle and then holding it there for a little bit. And yeah too much of that will affect your performance negatively, that's why you need to alternate it with ballistic stretching. I'm not very good with words but, ballistic stretching is when you kind of use gravity to stretch your limbs by doing kind of swinging and sort of jerking movements? You should just google it.
15591	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	At 1:20 I thought he was about to draw a penis.

15599	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	What about weightlifting ? Do you just hit the treadmill to get the blood pumping or is stretching still important?
15600	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	My question: What is it physically or mentally that enables these athletes able to train so hard?! How do they have the stamina?? Is it genetic?
15601	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	What about stretching AFTER the exercise?
15602	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	Explain.. How come the Cheeta does not stretch on the wild before Att and running like 60mph without cramping?

15605	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	Also, with decreasing soreness, I find that doing a full body 20-minute stretch in a sauna, steam room, or hot tub if you can find one or just in a hot shower, can really do a number on soreness the next day. Also, watching your diet and not eating really heavy, greasy foods and hydrating before and after a workout can also help. I don't know about the science behind this but it always helps me out.
15606	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	Is it necessary to warm up before stretching though? I swim, and am told by my coach to warm up before stretching, but in my martial arts classes, we stretch to warm up
15607	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	how flexible is moderately flexible???
15608	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEIoGMldyc	Ha! I knew I was right! Back in elementary school, I was the fastest kid and was in a school race. But the coach had us stretch way too much right before the race and for far too long. Ive ended up in last cause the stretching ruined my muscle power and stamina, while the others that didn't do much got good slots. Yet they blamed us/myself for not exercising enough. Take that you asshole teachers.

Like Testosterone 200: (2) shots per week of 200 mg shots. Or, 50-100 mg shots 4-5 days a week. This will make your muscles recover so quickly, you wouldn't believe it! If your in your 40s ? Get steroids. Oh! And most importantly eat right!

15626	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	I thought the muscle damage causing growth was a myth. From what I’ve understood, there’s two different types of muscle growth, hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Hypertrophy is when your muscle cells grow, hyperplasia is when you generate new muscle cells to repair and replace damaged ones. You want hypertrophy, to grow your individual muscle cells, so having too much muscle damage can actually hinder your gains. This is even observed in several studies showing massive drop offs and even declines in muscle growth after a certain amount of volume, particularly with higher weight, lower rep work.

15636	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Question: Why do bigger/stronger muscles make work easier? I understand how muscles grow but I don’t understand why that makes them stronger. For example a robotic arm can’t make itself stronger by working harder. What is the body doing that an engineer needs to do to make the robot stronger? Is the effort being spread out over more area or something?

15639	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	When I started working out, my two main mistakes were lack of sleep and not eating enough (not being in a caloric surplus). I always thought I was eating enough and was disappointed because my weight stagnated. Then I got my first diet plan created (I think it was from nextleveldiet iirc). I realised that my previous food intake was way below my needs, although I thought I'm good. At the beginning it was hard to eat 3500 kcal in a day, but I got used to it. I started noticing real gains and it felt amazing. I wish I'd understood the importance of diet earlier.

So our Capitalistic Parasites who exploit the workforce will indeed love this video to show their employees that all the stress they are being subjected to is in fact important for their own growth. Omitting that underpaid employees that can't rest enough nor afford proper nutrition in order to do grow."

15663	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	I have never seen a single bodybuilder ever lived 100 years. But I know guys who never exercised lived for 100 years. Look around you, you will see that normal people who go to work, laugh, eat and enjoy live longer and healthier than others.

15668	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	you why does the purple guy look like a bearded thanos
15669	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	So in theory, I can absolutely destroy my muscles from a work out and they will grow big?
15670	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	it's been 1 year and 6 months since I starting working out and I went from benching 85 to 150 not that impressive but a huge improvement along with tripling my squat record and having more weight overall,
15671	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	When my legs feel on fire does that mean I am becoming super strong
15672	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Bro why this dude purple tho
15673	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	I didn't know Thanos was such an Avid body-builder.
15674	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	But one key factor here is TIME. You will not gain alot of muscle mass in a couple of weeks or months. It takes years, be patient.

15686	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	3:57 A formal way of saying *No Pain NO GAIN*
15687	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	So what is not happening when your muscles don’t grow after workout? Something is happening with my body that is causing pain after I work them and I’m actually starting to experience muscle atrophy. It seems my muscles/ body tissues aren’t repairing. They are actually getting weaker 😔
15688	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	The most important thing is self confidence. This is the main motivation for every thing including building up muscle.
15689	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Hey: have you ever wonder 💭 who’s the guy with the clean voice
15690	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	"I would recommend squats and or leg presses on push day, and deadlifts and or back extensions on pull day. Chest press will be a good option as your major upper body exercise on push day, with seated rows being the main upper body move on pull day. Considering doing inclined and declined moves in addition to standard moves if possible. Keep in mind that shoulder presses are pretty much fully inclined chest presses, with chest dips being fully declined ones. For seated rows, fully inclined equals lat pulldown, and fully declined equals shoulder shrugs. Incorporating leg exercises into push and pull day makes it logical to make the third day in a three day circuit hybrid day. Hybrid day routines could consist of cable crossovers from a myriad of angles, and or to a myriad of focus points. Also, this might be a good day for ab exercises such as torso rotation and crunches. Also consider adding neck flexion and neck extensions somewhere in your routine. If you're doing squats and or leg presses on push day, in addition to doing deadlifts and or back extensions on pull day, it seems logical to do calf extensions and or calf raises on hybrid days; alternating between pushing with your toes and your heels should promote good activation levels in all calf muscles. One last note, adding “wood chops"" left to right, right to left, and straight down on push days, and “reverse wood chops"" left to right, right to left, and straight up on pull days might also help you maximize gains. As far as isolated arm movements go, I recommend tricep focused moves on push day, bicep focused moves on pull day, and forearm focused moves on hybrid day. It's worth noting that using a pronated grip tends to add focus to the triceps, using a supinated grip puts more focus on the biceps, and a neutral grip is more balanced. Furthermore, a wide grip puts more focus on the torso, while a narrow grip puts more focus on the arms, with a more neutral grip again being a more balanced option. It's likely a good idea to favor a neutral grip in terms of pronated and supinated as this tends to generate more muscle growth overall than a pronated or supinated grip, because it recruits many fibers in the biceps, triceps, and the brachialises that connect them, as well as the brachioradialus that connects all of these muscles to the forearm."

15708	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	What Makes Muscles Grow? (Transcrição) Muscles. We have over 600 of them. They make up between 1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight, and along with connective tissue, they bind us together, hold us up, and help us move. And whether or not body building is your hobby, muscles need your constant attention because the way you treat them on a daily basis determines whether they will wither or grow. Say you’re standing in front of a door, ready to pull it open. Your brain and muscles are perfectly poised to help you achieve this goal. First, your brain sends a signal to motor neurons inside your arm. When they receive this message, they fire, causing muscles to contract and relax, which pull on the bones in your arm and generate the needed movement. The bigger the challenge becomes, the bigger the brain’s signal grows, and the more motor units it rallies to help you achieve your task. But what if the door is made of solid iron? At this point, your arm muscles alone won’t be able to generate enough tension to pull it open, so your brain appeals to other muscles for help. You plant your feet, tighten your belly, and tense your back, generating enough force to yank it open. Your nervous system has just leveraged the resources you already have, other muscles, to meet the demand. While all this is happening, your muscle fibers undergo another kind of cellular change. As you expose them to stress, they experience microscopic damage, which, in this context, is a good thing. In response, the injured cells release inflammatory molecules called cytokines that activate the immune system to repair the injury. This is when the muscle-building magic happens. The greater the damage to the muscle tissue, the more your body will need to repair itself. The resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles bigger and stronger as they adapt to progressively greater demands. Since our bodies have already adapted to most everyday activities, those generally don’t produce enough stress to stimulate new muscle growth. So, to build new muscle, a process called hypertrophy, our cells need to be exposed to higher workloads than they are used to. In fact, if you don’t continuously expose your muscles to some resistance, they will shrink, a process known as muscular atrophy. In contrast, exposing the muscle to a high-degree of tension, especially while the muscle is lengthening, also called an eccentric contraction, generates effective conditions for new growth. However, muscles rely on more than just activity to grow. Without proper nutrition, hormones, and rest, your body would never be able to repair damaged muscle fibers. Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building blocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids. Adequate protein intake, along with naturally occurring hormones, like insulin-like growth factor and testosterone, help shift the body into a state where tissue is repaired and grown. This vital repair process mainly occurs when we’re resting, especially at night while sleeping. Gender and age affect this repair mechanism, which is why young men with more testosterone have a leg up in the muscle building game. Genetic factors also play a role in one’s ability to grow muscle. Some people have more robust immune reactions to muscle damage, and are better able to repair and replace damaged muscle fibers, increasing their muscle-building potential. The body responds to the demands you place on it. If you tear your muscles up, eat right, rest and repeat, you’ll create the conditions to make your muscles as big and strong as possible. It is with muscles as it is with life: Meaningful growth requires challenge and stress.

15825	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Looking at it that way, isn't building muscles kind of pointless and unnatural if our current lifestyle doesn't require them to grow?
15826	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Dose an iron door needs more strength to open then a wooden door ?
15827	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Why this video has so many dislikes?
15828	206	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	what does steroids do to them
15829	207	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	I need to damage my little muscle ASAP
15830	208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Callout to anyone taking neuroscience: At 1:45 they mention cytokines are released by injured muscle cells, are these the same cytokines that is linked to Alzheimer Disease??
15831	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	What is thanos doing here?

15834	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	But why the skinny legs though? Lol!
15835	213	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	They mentioned how muscle growth requires protein intake, yet as examples of food they showed apples and carrots, which have NO protein! How ironic.
15836	214	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Is there a difference between length of time muscles are expected to be used? Like does a sprinter develop inherently different muscles than a marathon runner?
15837	215	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Now I see reason to grow muscles, man I need to pet those giant cats
15838	216	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	"What part of the muscle actually tears. You just said ""tissue"". Is it the actin, myosin, z-discs, the cell membrane, or something else that tears?"
15839	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Im trying to build muscle but i cant stop my sugar habit. Im in the gym 5 days a week for two hours doing cardio and high reps and low sets. I take vitamins and drink plenty of water daily but Im not getting the results. I guess it may be genetic and my diet. My metabolism burns every food I eat into nothingness, that along with college track practice I deduce.
15840	218	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	What is leg day ?
15841	219	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Stress you muscles, relax your brain💙
15842	220	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	I dont know why but I think that I have seen this man before
15843	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	So then I chop my arm off and I get a super muscular one?
15844	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Thanks for the advice! Let me go grab a knife and some carrots.

15852	230	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	The video length is 4:20. the REAL secret to muscle growth is weed. 420 blaze it.
15853	231	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	My right arm is a lot stronger than my left arm
15854	232	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	People made fun of me for being small all my life, I worked out everyday, took protein powder, did everything right. But I never gained muscle. Not until I started taking a supplement called muscleX. I don't care what anyone says about supplements, but they helped me gain 30lbs of muscle in less than a month. And you can even try musclex for free, request a bottle here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbqt3x2CzM-LDdQI0-2sfB3JLMe7XEBDJrpJ3ptEN6Y/edit?usp=sharing
15855	233	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	The video is awesome, but my experience tells me is bull. I got a 20 years old crisis 2 years ago and I started doing daily 100 push up, 40 sits up, a full hour of abdominals(I managed this by watching cartoons 2 cartoons during the whole hour) and 4.2 miles, again, each day. All that for about 4 months just to look like badass muscular man, and guess what, no a single difference from the scrawny body, and 133 lb I have since I turned 17. Every 4 months I do a less exaggerated version of this training and still looking scrawny and weighten 133 lb.
15856	234	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	I have a question. Does muscle mean more strength? Are they the same thing? This video is about building muscle, but how do you build strength? I mean I've seen people with less muscle, who are stronger?
15857	235	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	can science provide us with a pill filled with those repair men? so we can grow muscles by taking a pill while watching tv.
15858	236	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Protein? What about vegan bodybuilders?

15861	239	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Hello , i have a question concerning muscular hypotrophy . If testosterone speeds up the muscles' recovery does that mean females will take more time to build muscle comparing to males ?
15862	240	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	so nutrition is all about getting a lot of protein?

15890	268	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Nice video! But I was hoping to find the answer to another interesting question: Do muscle cells divide?
15891	269	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	You forgot to mention the importance how eating HUGE amounts of food if you are trying to get big. Healthy food.
15892	270	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Isn't there a way to generate microscopic damages on a more comfortable way than going to gym?

I mean minds, sorry... Actually are slowly damaging themselves to achieve a temporary & superficial condition that will grant them more problems than benefits on the long term? THEN WHY THE FUCK DO PEOPLE LOVE TO GAIN MUSCLE... AND NOT SIMPLY STAY IN ""REGULAR"" SHAPE!?!?"

15933	311	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Isn't there a point where you can damage them too much, though?
15934	312	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	is there a reason to grow the muscles beyond every day's demand to which they are already adapted?
15935	313	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	I'm a skinny kid but I'm not weak. I want to gain muscle mass but i'm having a tough time doing it. I eat right and everything but they just don't get bigger. I think i need more carb intake but I'm not sure, is there anyone that can give me some advice?
15936	314	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	But I thought gender was a social construct with more than 50+ genders....
15937	315	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	"So is there any way we can use the ""muscle repairing cell"" with the really long name they mentioned artificially? For example just straight up eating a ton of them... Wouldn't in theory your body have an abundance therefor use more? Also y do I sometimes have a really good lift and I only feel sore for the next day and sometimes it takes a while... (Something to do with lactic acid I think) this is really interesting I always wonder how strong the people were before they knew that lifting will make them stronger."

15943	321	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	is there actual scientific data on whether drinking alcohol destroys muscle or is it a myth?
15944	322	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Someone help me please; what the correct sequence, if it matters; eat lots of protein first, then work out, or the other way round? Let's say I commit to working out for 1 hour every morning. Should I work out on an empty stomach first, then eat afterwards, or do I eat first, then work out? Does working out on an empty stomach not tire a person out sooner? Thanks.
15945	323	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	or maybe your body develops muscles as much as you need for your lifestyle and artificially increasing them is completely useless even unnecessarily stressful on your internal organs.
15946	324	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	3:00 you don't need meat or eggs for protein. All 9 essential amino acids are in plants.

15957	335	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	so in other words, you're basically damaging your muscle then waiting for it to repair? Correct?

15964	342	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	What is the science in increasing muscle strength without hypertrophy. Is it improving the efficiency or frequency of action potentials firing? Does that mean there is a genetic limit? And how can you improve that?
15965	343	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Wow this was incredibly accurate, I clicked assuming it'd be filled with garbage. Neurological adaptation, progressive overload, adaptation response, etc it covered the basics well

15968	346	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	genetics plays a huge role. I have one muscle that is peculiarly large despite zero workout there... And I've been working out for years on ALL my muscles EXCEPT that one.... and yet the genetically advantaged muscle, is still pretty large in comparison to all my worked-out muscles. You could say years of working out allowed my weaker muscles to catch up to the strong muscle that I was born with. Genetics plays a ridiculous role.

15973	351	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	then if i hit my musucle hard enough it can grow ??? XDDDD
15974	352	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	do i have to eat right after every workout?
15975	353	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	so what does steroids do ?
15976	354	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	so then how do women build strong muscles since they don't have testosterone?
15977	355	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Is it sad that I recognized Doom Guy's grunt at 00:22 ?
15978	356	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	On the other hand your muscles are perfectly adapted to your everyday life and daily activities therefore the muscle mass you have is just the amount you need and anything beyond that is just waste of energy and time. I mean you grow muscles by lifting heavy things at the gym so you can lift heavier things at the gym. Somehow this doesnt seem very sensible. Of course it attracts women so theres that.
15979	357	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Wish I could eat more... I struggle just to eat 2000 cals a day

15981	359	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	is it true that if we don't workout our muscles shrink? coz I got muscle and I don't want them so if I'll not workout and just don't lift anything my muscles will shrink?
15982	360	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	And yet body builbing has a huge dark side to body building.
15983	361	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	These Ted videos are all annoying and pretentious
15984	362	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	I don't think carrots are the best post-workout snack, might be better having a soya or whey protein shake

15986	364	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Want to get in shape easy? Do 10 to 20 pushups or something else every time you are waiting for the kettle to boil when you make a cup of coffee. If you drink coffee like me you will get a lot of workout done every day and it becomes part of your daily routine. This is all you need. Going to the gym for hours at a time is an unsustainable habit I have found. Life tends to get in the way of partitioning off that great a deal of time in your day. Life never tends to get in the way of me making coffee though and I thus have no excuse not to work out every day. This is the only thing I found that works for me, lost over 20kg this year already and I generated a surprising amount of muscle.
15987	365	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	A video that I can show my kids. Great Job TED.
15988	366	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	you forgot steroids
15989	367	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	That's so true. If you think about it slaves like in Egypt had very poor muscle and it's because the ruler didn't give them the nutritional value.
15990	368	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	The body responds to the demands you place on it? Well I've tried jumping out of a window several times now and I still can't fly. Can't walk very well either.
15991	369	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Cool! If this works, I can just tie my arm to a car to break my muscles to achieve growth! Be back asap.

15997	375	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	I do bodybuilding as a hobby and this video said it all perfectly about how to grow your muscle!
15998	376	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Is there a difference between big muscles and strong muscles?
15999	377	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	But huge muscles just look pretty gross... one of the main reasons I no longer go to the gym is because I ended up with huge calf muscles, which looked crazy with the rest of my body, so is there something you can do to lose weight healthily without gaining muscle instead?

16001	379	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Very good video but I wish there had been a greater a mount of detail. It was a little bit too simple.

16003	381	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	Don't skip leg day!
16004	382	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	This video didn't point out clearly enough that strength gains and hypertrophy aren't the same. Most strength gains for a beginner comes from neural adaptation, not muscle growth. That is, your body learns to use its muscles more efficiently. There's also two types of hypertrophy, sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar.
16005	383	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	no pain, no gain.
16006	384	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	why would our muscles shrink when we stop working out? Coz i thought it had already been damaged and repaired to a bigger size.
16007	385	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	will this work for my penis? :p no seriously though
16008	386	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	my left arm is more muscular than my right, is this normal?
16009	387	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	But the speed of muscle growing and the maximum reachable strongness alters from person to person.
16010	388	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	"Isn't hypertrophy pronounced ""hype-purr-tra-fee""?"
16011	389	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg	So if I just eat, sleep and open doors all day I'll have a six-pack? Shit guys this changes everything.

16029	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YImqb-g0pfo	A fellow gym enthusiast informed me yesterday about not doing so much cardio before a workout. I typically do 40 minutes. He said I would end up being tired and not be able to lift properly. I told him I knew that cardio does nothing to help weight loss, which is partly why I'm there, I just need something for my heart. He probably has a point, that is why I am here. Good video.

16052	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YImqb-g0pfo	dude, not gonna lie, the anime Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? brought me here because I couldn't believe that I've been lied to about static stretching by my school PE teacher and coaches all these years... thank man
16053	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YImqb-g0pfo	I used to do 5-10 minutes of cardio machines like the treadmill and bike prior to training. However now since I have allocated days of cardio, I now only do a range of dynamic and a couple of static pre warms ups prior to resistance training and no cardio machines . Would you recommend I include back my 5-10min cardio warms up or are dynamic warm ups enough? :)
16054	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YImqb-g0pfo	"Oh wow how wrong I was. I've been stretching slowly ""targeting"" the muscles I'm going to work out then jump on the stair master to get my heart rate up before work out. Thank you so much. I will do more research on this kind of stretching and will try it as well. Thank you !!!!"

16080	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	If you are a teenager in the ages of 17 or below, you shouldn't push your limits when it comes to you one rep max. Doing that while your body is still growing naturally can damage it severely and leave you with a shit back or joints for the rest of your life! Give yourself at least 6 months before you start to really test yourself.

16084	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Consistency is key. As long as you do compound exercises, push yourself, dont eat like a pig, and go at LEAST 3 times a week, you should be fine. If you dont see results, dont quit. It will come in time
16085	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Might've heard it wrong but u should not do 5, 3, or 1 rep. You should do between 8 to 12 for maximum muscle rip. After that, go heavier later on by doing 6-8 reps

16095	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	for anyone who cares to read, my brother in laws mother is one of the leading cardiologist in turkey and what she said to me was: it was newly discovered that everytime you push yourself too hard, there are micro injuries happening in your heart. as far as i remember heart tissue cannot reproduce itself. so dont push yourself extremely hard, know your limits.

16113	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Had to give a dislike. Begginers should def. Be using machines. You even reccomend begginers heavy weights????? Wtf.. Progressive overload can come in the form of resistance.... and intentional slow movemnts back to the down postition.... Machines literally tell you what to do. Push to the top. Hold for a second. Slowly return to starting position. This WILL HELP. Start on machines. Move to free weights. Then throw it all away for resistance bands
16114	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	wait how the hell does youtube know i've started goin to the gym recently?

16117	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	"Let's see - a review of my mistakes I did way back then as newbie at the gym, wanna see if you guys can relate (yeah probably not). 1) Locking knees on the leg press machine (luckily, nothing ever happened.... yes I know, fight me) 2) Trying to hit the weights a week early after getting 4 wisdom teeth and one of my ""k9"" teeth pulled. Needless to say, I literally ""HIT"" the weights when I passed out and was dragged to the showers half unconscious. (happened in highschool whatever... :/) 3) Trying to do cardio AND lift weights afterwards while on a pure vegan diet. Wait, it gets better. Did I mention I ate NO protein because I thought vegan meant NO protein? yeah a few hypoglycemia episodes later, lets just keep the story short and say I've never done that again :D 4) Working ONLY biceps. Shiiiit son, my biceps were the things of legend..... but them Tris were flatter than my x wife's boobs sooo yeah :P 5) For atleast 7 years, NEVER did I EVER do any back workouts. Chest - check, arms - check, legs - check, abs - check..... back - ""wtf we need to do back too?"" -.- yeah yeah whatever, fuck all of you too! That's all I can remember at the top of my head."
16118	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Machines are good for beginners to build muscles and prepare themselves from free weights Light weights are very effective and build muscles. 3 repping anything is begging for an injury. High reps increase strength and endurance with less chance on injury, not saying lifting heavier doesn't have advantages.
16119	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I’m new to my gym. And I don’t do any of these. Personally, I’m surprised people don’t bring water, or don’t accept any help. I thought that’s the norm. Welp, guess I was wrong
16120	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	But I hate talking so I dont wanna ask for help
16121	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	When going to the gym you dont want to do full body workouts every day, focus on different groups each day, so you are not straining any muscles.
16122	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	#6 dont skip legday
16123	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Love how you put in the idiocracy reference. That was awesome

16125	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	:( I couldn’t even lift the bar on its own.
16126	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Oh yeah yeah take over time
16127	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	What happen when you cannot progressively overload? If i go heavier, i just get less rep in my usual set. Not only that, subsequent exercise get lower in # of reps too. I end up stagnating for months on end.
16128	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Here’s what I do at the gym: the first day of going I find my complete max weight on bench press deadlift and squat. After that write it down in a notebook and take percentages. So you would start off with 40% of your max for five reps and so on and my notebook looks like this: 40% x 5 50% x 5 60% x 5 75% x 5 85% x 5 5 sets of 5 reps of 65% Do this and alternate workouts like do Monday deadlift, Tuesday run, Wednesday benchpress, Thursday run, Friday squat, and weekend rest. Even if your max is not high at all this will still work you to your fullest if your a beginner I recommend this.

16138	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Biggest mistake i made in the start was doing cardio everday i was only about 46-49kg and now Im around 65kg still doing it but not everyday
16139	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	hey wtf was that demon on the lower right side of the video that was shown for a blink @ 0:27- 0:28
16140	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	1. Only using machines (height, unnatural movement, no strength stabilizing) 2. Too many isolation exercises (compound movements = more muscles in less time, max weight increased) 3. Only using light weights (push your limits for more gains) 4. Not drinking water (combat against dehydration) 5. Not asking for help (allow others to motivate and help)
16141	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	The first machine you showed isn’t just for squatting, lmao
16142	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	An actual beginner mistake is lifting heavier than you are able to fuel your ego infront of your friends. Lift light and do high reps as a beginner until you have the form down or else you will just get injured.
16143	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	It’s 5 am I’ve been going to the gym for many years now and am very experienced. Why tf am I here
16144	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Steps in order for most efficient workout 1. Body weight warm ups 2. Compound exercises 3. Isolation exercises 4. Machine exercises
16145	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Whoever is new to lifting. Here's some advice. 1. Focus on form if you wanna get big. Sometimes lighter weight is better If your form is breaking down. 2. Do compound and isolation lifts in the gym. 3. What you eat outside of the gym impacts your gains and how you perform the next few days. 4. Drink water. 5. The most important is being CONSISITENT. I didnt watch the video but these are things I'd tell myself if I could go back to when I was 16 17.
16146	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Is ok to do more lots of reps if you only have light weights
16147	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	The lift heavy to get muscles or to improve is total BS. You will get results if u lift light with more reps and sets too.
16148	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	1. It depends. 2. It Depends. 3. IT depends. 4. iT dEpEnDs. 5. Depends it.
16149	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	The first point missed one important thing, machines is often necessary in the beginning for starting with chins/pull ups, same for dips.
16150	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I've got a question. Does nutting cause any problems? Like a stall in muscle growth or not get the same muscle mass otherwise?
16151	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	yeah i’m 13 so i’m not lifting my heaviest cause i don’t want to stay 5’4 forever
16152	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I do 10 reps a set is that ok?
16153	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	>Barely does one rep >Puts on more weight next time >Tears a muscle good shit my dude. XD
16154	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Dry workouts are good sometimes too, because when your body is dehydrated it bonds oxygen and Hydrogen from fat stores to make water internally
16155	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I don't get the pizzas joke, do they give pizzas in American gyms?
16156	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I weigh 72,9kg and i need to mantain this weight for competition, is there any way i can mantain weight and get stronger?
16157	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	IF You can do easily more then 15 Reps the weight is to light to build muscle.
16158	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	"Muscles don't have a brain they don't care how heavy you lift as long as you lift until you run out of ""Steam"" they will still grow and yes lifting heavy will make your body look a bit different than someone lifting Lighter weights"
16159	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Ok I disagree with the first machines point. Beginners SHOULD start with machines to avoid injury.
16160	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	#6 Having 3 sets of dumbells around you when the gym is packed
16161	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	1 to 3 repping is very dangerous especially for beginners. Once you develop good form you can try this strategy, but when you re new go for reps between 8 and 15 for minimizing the chance of injury!

16170	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I wonder, is there any evidence on the benefits of training those stabilizing muscles? It's always used as an argument to use more free weights, but why is it important?
16171	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	What's the healthiest and safest way to loose fat? Including which diets are the best to loose the fat.
16172	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	You don’t only have to life a heavier weight to achieve progressive overload, study’s have shown that if you use a lighter weight but go till failure you will make the same muscle gains.
16173	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	One kid I know was bragging about how he could bench 300+ lb. He went to the gym very often, but his gym doesn’t have free weights, only machines. So we set him up with 300 in our school’s weight room and he unracks it, only to have it fall to the side and flip over onto the floor. Turns out he had little to no stabilizing muscles, so when doing free weight bench he couldn’t stabilize the 300lb
16174	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	0:08 where’s the pizza 🍕. Is that planet fitness?
16175	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I always recommend Starting Strength or 5x5 Strong Lifts workout programs for begginers. It's a great way to build progressive strength focusing on compound exercises
16176	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Hi how do I balance the barbell when doing bench press. I can help it even with no weights lol
16177	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Can somebody answer my question please. I’ve been in the gym for awhile and have finally passed my newbie gains. But I’m wondering if I should do full body workout 3 times a week now

16180	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Is it good to take a gym break? for example every 4 month 1 week off
16181	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	using only 3 or 5 reps is best for strength gains but for muscle hypertrophy ideal rep range is 6 to 12 and definitely not 1 rep. correct me if i m wrong
16182	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I get the “I don’t lift but I’m experienced enough to give advice” vibe from this guy. No?
16183	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Doing less than 6 reps increases risk for injury and that's the last thing a beginner needs.
16184	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I'm training for 15+ years and I gotta say point 3 (the heavy weight part) it total bs! Yes, once in a while you can go for max strength with 1-3 reps, but doing it on regular basis? Or worse: being able to do only 1 rep and next time people should put even more weight on?! Don't do that guys, use light weights first, concentrate on doing the excercise right, build a soild mind-muscle-connecten and when you can actually feel and target the muscle, then increase the weight. Choose a weight, so that you can do 8- 12 reps, 6- 14 is also fine, as long as you tire out your muscle. But only going for 1-3 reps will only increase strenght, not actually visible muscle mass. Also as a beginner, starting with that heavy weight, you can injure yourseld pretty easy.

16191	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I'm not a beginner but i shy away from free squats and deadlifts because I'm worried about injury. Had lower back issues since early teens and i just dont like the pressure you feel from it. I think if a person can't, or doesn't want to squat you can recommend box jumps or something more functional that still works on stabilization muscles.

16196	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	I notice your channel has been very aimed towards beginners lately, which is fine tbh, but I personally feel like it ends up becoming... repetitive (?) I don't mean to be rude, this is an amazing channel and even got me introduced into smart lifting, but I believe this is a great medium to break down in simple pieces more complex stuff, such as periodization or training methods (giant sets, pyramids, etc.), and I believe you could go a little farther, you know? I've personally noticed that learning about complex stuff (thanks, Nuckols) early in my training has led me to better results, and I believe your channel is perfect to simplify the complexity (and saving beginners the hours of extensive incomprehensible reading). Just my opinion, though. Sorry for the bother.

16200	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Number 3 is misleading and simply wrong. Lifting heavy and doing progressive overload does not limit you to 6 or less reps. Studies show similar muscle growth for high reps also, even up to 30 (progressive overload still needed)
16201	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Biggest mistake is not being consistent

16206	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Here's my problem - I go to an government gym, where there are not so many weights or machines but even though I go there as I can't afford for private gyms, but now the weights I have there are very light for me now, what should I do???
16207	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	As a beginner, all you need to do for starting is the bench press, overhead press, Pulldown, Squat and Deadlifts and your gains will be so much faster than the isolation machines. You gotta have a really good form for your own accord though, so spend the first month doing these with just the bar so you get accustomed to the proper movement. And don't go for 1 rep max from the beginning, you risk potential injuries even with proper form because you are weak at the start. 5 sets of 5 is the best. Your welcome
16208	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	"@PictureFit how important are stabilizer muscles if the goal is mostly aesthetic (no planning to do competition)? What give faster muscle between working with free weight bench press VS machine bench press given ""almost"" same weight (with machine I add little more weight than free weight because it's lil bit easier) + same volume ?"
16209	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWoegDcHMI	Can anyone help, I'm stuck on certain weights when it comes to bicep curls and bench presses. If i try to add more weights i fail to lift and can't progress, how do i progress?

Lifting heavy is great, *after* a person has consistently good form. Just like being in shape isn't just about the size of your arms; lifting isn't just about the weight on the bar."

Notice how by the time these guys fall to the mat they stiffen up really unnaturally in the trunk and lower limbs ? (search decorticate/decerebrate posturing in google). That's very similar to the kind of increased muscle tone/abnormal posturing you get with damage to the brain like in a stroke or intra-cranial bleed for example. I can only imagine its because of temporary ""stunning"" of the higher centers of control in the brain - the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord then takeover for awhile leading to the abnormal posture and stiffness. I keep thinking of the soft brain tissue suspended in the cerebrospinal fluid bouncing back and forth like a vibrating ping pong ball in the hard skull. Can only imagine the impact it would take to ""stun"" the brain so completely like that (even if temporarily). Those are some REALLY hard punches to the head. Hope to God these guys are alright afterwards"

16232	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Joaquin Buckley obviously deserves the KOotY, but Cody's big right hook is absolutely beautiful, and would deserve the win any other year. That might be the most authoritative punch ever thrown in MMA.

16234	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I think we can all agree that Holland's knockout on Buckley was way better than the knockout on Jacare Souza.
16235	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody’s knockout is underrated, it wasn’t as clean as Buckley’s but you gotta admit that hook was so well timed and satisfying.

16257	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	To be honest, Kevin's KO was when you finally stand up to the guy who has been bullying you for the last 4 years but you grew. 4 years of pent up emotion released at once.

16262	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	That last one was amazing. He knocked him out with the first punch thrown from the bottom. Notice the guy sat there in guard with his hands up lazily defending. He was acting on instinct because he was already out. Then he got blasted again and it showed how far gone he already was. Insane.
16263	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	there was no need for that second shot from Williams- his opponents head literally bounced off the canvas. sloppy...
16264	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	This is tough pick kinda. Gotta go with Buckley. But damn... some of those other ones are more brutal.

16280	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	It's funny how the commentators had no idea Jacare was practically unconscious after the first shot in that clip.

16288	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I really really like No Love’s, the speed and the timing of the KO it was outstanding. But then came Buckley’s... it’s a no-brainer. It’s an insane and one-of-a-kind of a KO. He has to win it.

16307	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	0:55 best knock out of the YEAR for sure, that is flipping MATRIX shit
16308	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley’s definitely looks cooler, but Holland’s just is insane to me still. Way harder to generate that much power from that position.
16309	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	ima let UFC finish in a moment but Joaquin Buckley had the greatest KO of all time
16310	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley’s KO is something you’ll probably never see again. Holland’s is brutal, Garbrandt’s punch is lightning fast but Buckley’s is still the most impressive
16311	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	This really must be a no brainer right? Buckley's kick is one for the history books, no one else was even close.
16312	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Kevin Holland deserves Ko of the year; Jacare was a good opponent and he fought four times this year too

16314	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	They’re missing the one where holland KOed buckley.
16315	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody Garbrandt knockout was the most clean and dope... That was a pure counter Skill, waiting to throw the big right at the right moment.
16316	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley, Holland was a close second. I don’t think anyone expected him to win that fight, including me. Garbrandt got lucky with his haymaker.
16317	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Holland's was cool, but Buckley's KO is just on another level.

16326	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Joe Rogan: who’s faster than Garbrandt? Dillashaw: hold my beer
16327	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	No Shawn O’Malley?
16328	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Why did they include Khaos' KO, it is just a regular straight right KO. They need to include any of Israel Adesanya's KO. He intelligently put himself in the harm's way to deliver a KO in each case.
16329	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Um where is the the O'Malley knock out ? Looks like to me it was replaced with Kevin Holland. Great knock out O'Malley !
16330	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I am surprised they even have to do this this year. Buckley's knockout is easily the nastiest KO ever seen in the sport.
16331	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Usman breaking Colby's face was my knockout of 2020, for more than a billion reasons. That day the good guy won. The world was a better place to live in for a day. Also, the runner-up was Biden knocking out Trump aka Colby's dad's arse in election 2020. Honourable mention goes to Covid-19 knocking everyone's arse in 2020.
16332	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	disrespect to omalley
16333	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Commentator: “he hung in the AIR FOR LIKE TENNN SECONDS”
16334	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley coolest knockout of the year. Holland is by far the most brutal.
16335	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I like Holland’s the most, Never seen someone do that off their back, then proceed to stand over them, Super Savage!
16336	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody's KO was against a RANKED opponent not past his prime, and at the last second of the round. Cody wins
16337	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	"""I don't think there is a man faster"" Early 2000's Vitor: Hold my beer...."
16338	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	holland wins cos he birthed buckley, baptised him in their fight then set him free into the wilderness
16339	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I like Cody’s Ko the best it was just ruthless, Raphael looked dead.
16340	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	dariush had two crazy ko’s and you couldn’t even add one
16341	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	1:48 I'm innocent, officer
16342	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody should get it. That’s my all time favorite KO
16343	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	He's not my favorite fighter but O'Malley threw that punch at Weinland SO FAST. It should be considered.
16344	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody with the one punch K.O. That was as clean as it gets.
16345	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	in hindsight, I really like the No Love knockout the most. That KO was vicious, and the walkaway priceless.
16346	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Every striking coach ever: you generate power from your legs Kevin Holland: hold my beer
16347	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Real life ninja stuff is the winner, easier winner there’s ever been.
16348	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Joaquin Buckley was the first I ever seen to get his opponent to a Mortal Kombat 'Finish Him' state. 1:10
16349	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Kevin Holland’s KO definitely deserves most “Brutal” KO of the year.
16350	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Haha O’Malley’s KOn wasn’t a nominee, Aldanas should of been one
16351	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley one should win, so insane. The Garbrant KO was my favorite though, dude is so quick.
16352	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I love how Khaos walked away with his hands up like the ref was the cops.
16353	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Joaquin Buckley's knockout has to be the best of 2020. It was actually one of the best knockouts of all time
16354	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Uh, is that a rhetorical question? Buckley, without question.
16355	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley. No argument.
16356	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley had this award the second his kick landed.
16357	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody for sure.
16358	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Where’s suga we all know he won KO of the year
16359	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Geez...Im torn between Cody and that spinning back kick.
16360	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley was playing Mortal Kombat when everyone else was playing Swords and Sandals
16361	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Joaquin Buckley however I feel like there were some more knockouts missing
16362	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	"""He hung in the air for like 10 seconds "" exaggerated exaggeration."
16363	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I’m impressed more that Kevin holland won all 5 fights in this year and he only 28
16364	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Valentina Shevchenko Kick to Eye
16365	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Obviously Buckley
16366	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Part of me wishes fans would never come back, I loved the fights this year! What a great year for the UFC!
16367	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley all day, Holland's runner up the man was on his back goddamn
16368	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Punch: Garbrandt Kick: Buckley
16369	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley's KO is the most unique and ninja style. Whereas Cody has sweet one-punch buzzer knockout
16370	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckleys might be in the top KO's of all time let alone this year.
16371	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Remove Buckley's KO and rename the video to ''Which one of these is second best knockout of the year''
16372	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley is in KO of all time contention, he won this years hands down 🙌🏻
16373	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Idk Cody knockout to me looks like perfection
16374	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	IMO a KO of the year also has to depend on the stakes. The Buckley KO was nice but it was between 2 unranked nobody's with low stakes.
16375	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Holland the champion, them other knockouts pretty good. - Django
16376	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Holland grabing the shoulder and beating the man on his knees, pure madness.
16377	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	0:56 I still can’t believe that KO
16378	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Kevin Holland mayne
16379	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	What about o’malleys walk off KO
16380	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Its very simple lol Buckley for KO of the Year Holland for Fighter of the Year
16381	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Kevin Holland KOing Buckley should’ve been on here.
16382	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody Is gonna win that ko of the year
16383	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody garbrants KO reminds me of snatch
16384	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Hard to pick between Holland and Buckley!
16385	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Holland for sure. Even heavyweights haven't been able to generate that power from that position.
16386	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Joaquin Buckley by far dude XD Holland's was great but Buckley's is in another level
16387	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	What happen to Sean O’Malley’s knockout?
16388	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Thought for sure Buckley had done it, then Kevin Holland came out and MERCed Jacare. AND Holland starched Buckley earlier this year, so......
16389	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Goodens voice bugs the shit outta me lol
16390	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Why is Kevin Holland’s KO in the beginning and the end? I guess he wins KO of the year?
16391	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley’s KO should be knockout of the decade let alone knockout of the year.
16392	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Where's my boy Khamzat?
16393	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I've had people TRY that switch kick when I snatched there foot and I have ko'd a dude with a head butt from the bottom. Therefore I vote khaos for that CLEAN left straight that was unbelievable!
16394	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Kev. I’ve seen plenty of spinning back KOs. They’re a dime a dozen in TKD tournaments. I’ve never seen anybody knock anyone out quite like Holland knocked out Jacare. Not even Niko. And not against an all time great Grappler like Souza. Kevin Holland ftw 💪🔥
16395	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Imo it’s between Holland and Buckley. I’ve never seen a ko from guard and the way he stood up over jacare makes him scary. Buckley’s ko was straight outta a karate movie. That shit is rare
16396	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody all the way... He beat the bell and that punch was sickening 🤘🏻
16397	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley secured that without question - Arguably the best KO in UFC history let alone 2020 💥
16398	171	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Kenny west I mean Kevin Holland gay fish in the year
16399	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley’s knockout was something else
16400	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Jordan Leavitt’s KO of Matt Wiman is missing. That’s #2 for me after Buckley.
16401	174	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody made the UFC the NBA by bouncing Assuncao’s head off the floor and scoring a buzzer beater
16402	175	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	1:32 Tell me he doesn’t look like DaBaby 😭
16403	176	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	For a straight up KNOCK OUT its Garbrants! But I am for Team HOLLAND FOR 2020 KO
16404	177	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	It’s between Buckley and Cody to me, Cody’s was probably the most surprising while Buckley’s was just pure uniqueness
16405	178	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	The Holland KO was the most impressive IMO
16406	179	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Although Buckley wins, he should give it to his father, Mr. Holland. Just as a thanks for birthing him into the game.
16407	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Holland must be so proud of his son for getting the knock out of the year, A father couldn’t hope for anything better 🖤
16408	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Khaos Williams gets it. He had Razak out for ten straight minutes, and to do that to a guy ad underated and dangerous as Alhassan is insane. Buckley's is for sure #2.
16409	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley’s KO was insane!!! He made me stand up and scream!!
16410	183	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I take into account quality of competition. Holland has the best KO and it's by a landslide.
16411	184	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	UFC needs a new editor. Put 2 of the same knockouts in this edit like cmon 😂.
16412	185	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Not Buckley because the way he runs out feels like he was just looking for a spinning push kick and got lucky. Cody's got my vote. Just keeping it real.
16413	186	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Khamzat Chimaev?
16414	187	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	The fact that Sean Omalleys isnt on here is great haha
16415	188	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Is Sean O'Malley crying that he's not on the list/
16416	189	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	That Buckley one still gives me shivers when I watch it
16417	190	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley with the best KO OF THE 21st century. So dope. Holland's was straight SAVAGE though! 🔥 I've never seen anything like either 😳
16418	191	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	For everyone saying Buckley.. jus remember.. Holland Starched him🤨😂
16419	192	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley had the coolest looking KO but Holland’s was super hard to pull off so I’m torn between those two.
16420	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I love Kevin Holland's, it reminds me of Wanderlei vs Jardine, but better
16421	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	How did Cody make the video when Sean had a better knockout the same night
16422	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	O'Malley fans about to be pissed lol
16423	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Suga knocking out Eddie was better then Cody’s knockout😂
16424	197	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Agreed. There’s some top notch but Buckley takes it. It’s a straight out of Tekken style knockout even the reaction to it.
16425	198	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	The Buckley kick was cool, but the Holland KO from the back was WAY more shocking to me.
16426	199	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	O’Malley vs Wineland? I wouldn’t have voted for it but it should still be a nominee
16427	200	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Kevin Holland just because of who he did it to and how he did jacare Buckley was amazing but he did it on impa if he would had done it to a guy like jacare then yeah ko of the decade but he did it to impa so IMO Kevin Holland ko of the year
16428	201	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	"I liked the ""bus driver uppercut"" from Cody the most"
16429	202	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Joaquin Buckley Easily Got This 💯👊
16430	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Sean o'malley not even a choice? I mean i know buckleys winning but damn o'malleys ko was also sick
16431	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	OMG that Buckley KO is one of the most perfect things I’ve ever seen in this sport.
16432	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley's was cool but Cody starched a top 5 contender with one of the craziest one punch ko's I've ever seen. Context should matter when considering these things. I would choose either Cody or Holland based on the level of competition.
16433	206	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	I think cody won ! The Dodge and k.o was ridiculous! The kick one was just something we never seen before
16434	207	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Khamzat vs Gerald should be mentioned
16435	208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	This should be for second place really
16436	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley’s has to be the best in ufc history?
16437	210	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Where is Suga Sean’s ko against Eddie Wineland? That has to be in the conversation!
16438	211	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	omalley had the best knockout
16439	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	0:36-DC sounds like a chicken
16440	213	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Where’s Cory sandhagens ko over moraes
16441	214	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	He hung in the air for 10 seconds..... or 1 second
16442	215	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Been some amazing kos this year. But there can be only one. And we all know it’s Buckley. What a kick!!!
16443	216	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Wow
16444	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	What an actual good year of knockouts
16445	218	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Joaquin Buckley and it’s not even a debate.
16446	219	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Honestly Cody's is better than Buckley'€
16447	220	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	The only man that got Kanye to make him the song cover deserved it !! 😂😂 that was mean
16448	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	There was no point in this lmao we all know who's got this
16449	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Its buckley by far! But holland still torched him
16450	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Buckley. Hands down.
16451	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	We all know who is the winner
16452	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1RzOeVtroY	Cody is easily the winner
16453	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Pretty sure God isn’t praising men beating the crap out of each other
16454	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	imagine reitiring undefeated with as many matches as he fought we wont see someone like khabib for a long time
16455	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Can someone translate his speech in the end? Thanks you
16456	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib boring fighter👎👎👎
16457	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He quit because hes the male equivalent of Rhonda Rousey. Double let take down, lay and pray repeat. Most boring mma fighter ever. I'm glad hes gone. We need fighters not wrestlers. It's why the ufc and Bellator are losing viewers.
16458	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He gave nobody a rematch because he knew he would lose one of them. That and the fact that he only had 13 UFC fights is why he isn't the GOAT in my opinion.
16459	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Can i just say the GOAT of octagon
16460	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I have no idea how hard it is to leave the stage at the peak of your career. The biggest star of UFC at that time, media , money fame everything revolve around this man and he still choose to leave everything of that? is mind blowing...
16461	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Was he the best to ever do it? Jon Jones is great and has never lost but this guy as never even lost a round in my opinion.
16462	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	It too earlier i think why he retired
16463	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Alhamdulillah ❤️❤️ proud to be muslim
16464	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	1 year later an say the same with no likes.....khabib is an inspiration for everyone- no trash talk.. he has so much respect an don't know if he knows how much he is loved around the world in all walks of life- amazing human ❤

16472	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Listen to this man. I lost my father 2 months ago. The time flys by when they are alive. Not a day has gone by when I haven’t thought about him. I miss my father every day and wish I could go back in the past and spent every second I could have with him. Anyone that’s fortunate enough to still have both parents, please enjoy it.
16473	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	HE IS GREATEST FOREVER...
16474	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib is a fake fighter and this wife is this cousine....
16475	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Böyle spor mu olur yapanında seveninde canı cehenneme, böyle insanlık yerin dibine batsın , hayvanlardan daha aşağılık insanlarsiniz , insan insana bunu yaparmı ,medeniyetimiz çağdaşlığınız bumu aşağılıklar. To hell with people who do sports like this, let humanity sink to the ground like this, you are people less than animals, can people do this to people, our civilization and your modernity are despicable. You cannot be a person who loves and watches this, Allah will hold you accountable in the hereafter. Keep this in mind.
16476	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	As a McGregor fan, have a good retirement Khabib

16478	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I have never cried after watching a fight before, when he was in the middle of the cage crying, I cried, my husband cried. I do not care how old you are, what you have been trough in this life, your parents deserve respect from you. If they leave this world and you have not treated them with respect, you will go the rest of your life wishing you did while they were still here. Don't do that to them or to yourself. If your parents stood by you, provided you with a home, security and shelter, they deserve your respect, for some reason in our country today, very few know how to show their parents respect. Kids think we owe them happiness, no we owe them shelter, food and security from the world. Your parents guide and shelter you, it is you who is responsible for your happiness. You will gain much happiness if you show your parents resect. This was a great fighter, a great son, father and most of all a great human being. I am grateful to have witnessed the rise of Khabib. There will be very few to reach the level he has.

16510	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	This is so sad... I dont comment on anything really, but this tugs on my heart strings. He is so loved and respected that English speakers don't skip his native language. I can feel the love in his voice, it's beautiful. Love how the last thing he did was tell dc , love you brother.... personally never been a DC hater glad the Russians were able to show the world what there made of and open peoples eyes to the man DC is. Much love from an American to my Russian brothers, I've worked with alot of them on visas here on the east coast and they all were good trustworthy people never met a bad egg.
16511	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	And from now I quit watching UFC

16523	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Afraid of tony ferguson 😂😈😈😈
16524	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He is beloved because of his love towards sports , no trash talk, no flexing, just pure love. Kudos to you CHAMP
16525	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib is like Muhammad Ali. He won all the fights in his ufc history, was a good man (didn t drink, didn t trash talk, worked hard), and respected people for what they did. Then, he retired young. *L e g e n d*
16526	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	That smelly hat
16527	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Got tired of hugging men finally.

16529	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He was afraid that he must lose the streak 😄😄😄
16530	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Yes and he's such a good person. I think/hope that given a few years he'd do 1 last fight to do what his Father truly wanted..... 30-0 and last fight against GSP!
16531	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Came from the mountains, wiped out the lightweight division, returned back to the mountains pledging to never fight again. What a legend. He will be forever remembered.
16532	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Repent and BELIEVE IN LORD GOD JESUS CHRIST
16533	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	How on earth so many people say that he is really humble?! The guy just tell at the ufc to put him number one and undisputed on whatever s*** list?!?
16534	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Did anyone even realize when he started ufc with the age of 22, 10 years ago, he didnt even could talk english?
16535	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	“God Gave me Everything”; I’m not a religious person, but the fact he said it as soon as he won, that’s a guy who knows the kids watch.
16536	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	11k dislikes are these real people??
16537	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Retired, because the defeat will come eventually :D
16538	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	0:28 how many of you notice that he doesn't have a finger on his left leg
16539	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	What is that fur hat about?

16541	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	What's he say at the end ?
16542	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	When I first watched this I started having a drinking problem.
16543	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	30-0 has to happen
16544	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Quit before you have to give rematch to any of your earlier opponents. 🙄 A better way to honor your parents would be to become a double or triple champ. But I guess not everyone has the balls to dream big. 🤷
16545	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I believe kamzat is better than khabib...he finish all opponents..do u people agree.?
16546	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib made me think about religions differently and that's huge
16547	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Its respectful, at right time... A fighter life is short span.. If he continues he must face losses and that will hurt his ego...
16548	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He said there is no way he is going to fight without his father. Figuratively speaking, 50% of his strength comes from Mr. Abdulmanap who was his father, coach and inspiration. Let destiny seal his 29-0 record. Khabib is the true GOAT, the only and only CHAMP.
16549	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	The name will live on. Now Hasbulla Magomedov will carry that name on his shoulders. Eentering the ring, The king, the one and only Mini Khabiiiiiiiiiib!!!
16550	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Never a fan of Khabib's but I have always respected his talent and warrior mindset.
16551	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Why did he retire?
16552	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	yea, give props to homophobic fundamentalist
16553	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Can anyone translate the final part of his speech? Thank you in advance.
16554	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	How can anyone dislike this video? Absolute trash
16555	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	jon jones ego is just annoying...
16556	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	gets exposed and almost loses then retires... funny
16557	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Joe Rogan said he never went so fast from jerking it to crying as when he was watching this.
16558	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Can someone translate the last part of his statement please
16559	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib is an inspiration for all muslims all around the world
16560	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	A defense against Conor Justin and Dustin. Wish he could've defended against others particularly really good ground game opponents which none of his defense titles were against.
16561	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	11k dislikes from Christians
16562	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib is a bum ,Gaetchje got robbed .And he retired because he is afraid of a smack
16563	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He shed more tears then blood in the octagon. U will never see another fighter that dominated any sport like this. Appreciate him now he’s retired the undisputed goat along with gsp
16564	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I remember watching this live with my father and he said “Amazing Decision “ and 22 February my dad passed away😔 it was the worst day of my life
16565	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Probley because he didn't want to have to wear that goofy head dress again ??!
16566	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	A brilliant fighter and human too. There will never be anyone else like him. G.O.A.T!
16567	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	If I were Justin I could not have been more honoured. He was Khabib‘s last opponent and witnessed this speech.
16568	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	That childhood bear is probably saying “don’t forget who gave you your first start.”
16569	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	WWE ...... try to buy this fighter surely
16570	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	A humble god..unlike Connor
16571	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I wish you all best in life khabib... I'm not Muslim but I think it's proper to say... salamu alaykum (forgive me if I didn't write it correctly)
16572	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He should have retired 30-0
16573	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	His final words in a UFC OCTAGON as a fighter, DC, I LOVE YOU BROTHER!! What a frickin Bond. A white russian who barely spoke English, An African American DC.. wow the world can learn so much from this
16574	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 idc what others say.
16575	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Overrated fighter who fought bums throughout his career
16576	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	30-0 if he chokez dana white because asking him to not retire yet
16577	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Don't forget he's best mates with Kadyrov. :) Doesn't deserve to be celebrated whatsoever.
16578	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	"He is a true inspiration to all fighters, he taught to respect, stay humble and always prays to God. UNBEATABLE, UNDEFEATED , ONE N ONLY KHABIB The Eagle Nurmagomedov. Greatest UFC Fighter Past, Present and Future. ""Allahamdullilah""."
16579	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Charles Oliveira has become a new lightweight champion for 11th in the division. Who will be the next 12th champion ?
16580	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	His faith for his god is really inspiring 🔥🔥
16581	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I don't really like him,but I RESPECT do him!!
16582	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Started because of his father Ended because of his mother Moral of the story: Connor won't get a chance to beat him😂... Happy retirement champ🙏
16583	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Man.. Such a loyal person and friend.. Remembers his coach and DC and says 'I love you' to both of them. Remembers how Justin helped him cut weight in 2016. He's a class act. And so is Justin. Justin deserves a lot more, especially the way he carries himself.
16584	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	"Little anyone know the real name of khabib. Habib = the one who love Nur = light Muhammad = Rasulullah/prophet Ov = ""i didnt know this"" Habib Nurmuhammadov = Muhammad's light that people love. And prophet Muhammad is the best wrestler no one can defeat him somehow this is connected. https://youtu.be/Q4B6IIh1iWA"
16585	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	But What is the reason behind Retirement of Khabib I want to see khabib vs Tony fight Anyway khabib is best ufc fighter
16586	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	It takes a man like Khabib to be like he is, in what is considered a bloody profession, and with the current image of Islam in the world, he is bearing a lot of moral burden. Just like a man, plain and pure strong...
16587	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Just breathe bro damn
16588	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	still tears me up a bit but i aint no bitcc

16590	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	why is he wearing a wig can someone explain
16591	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	No fake confidence, no trash talk, just PURE fight skills and class. Long life Khabib !!!
16592	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Bnyakan gaya
16593	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I think 🤔 hes not happy being a fighter in his own will . It's just his old man wants that .he is inspired when his father acknowledges him. He love being acknowledge by his father. But now his father died. His Will for fighting is gone. And a relief he retire on body aches.. he's so tired doing that .. sorry im a judgemental person 😂
16594	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	You may hate him , You may love him But you can't ignore him What a personality dude❤️ Respect.❤️
16595	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	*You either die a hero,or live long enough to see yourself become a villain*
16596	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	ONE WORD IS ENOUGH FOR KHABIB.... ALHAMDULILLAH ☝️
16597	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	i had the chills the whole time
16598	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I really can't take Khabib seriously here with that hair cut. He looks like a fuckin feather duster 🤣🤣🤣 oh shit wait is it a hat or hair? Either way it's really beyond bizarre. I can't even begin to deal with it
16599	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Hes great but constantly struggled to get weight n never moved up,,,,, so really he was a heavier guy who cut so bad every fight to put weight on to smoother the opposition so never will be a great at one struggling weight
16600	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I love Khabib and his record will forever leave a dynasty and I hope people look up to him as a role model and for inspiration. But I just can't find myself categorising him as one of the greatest ever as I just found him very one dimensional and not very entertaining.
16601	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Why the hell is nobody wearing a mask?
16602	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	“DC, I love you brother”. Last words in the octagon. What a legend.
16603	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Islam is a message for humanity
16604	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I salute you khabib and i feel what you felt about your father, when i hear you saying words about your father I can’t hold my tears back. Rest in paradise both of our father’s.
16605	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	"too lazy to translate everything he said in russian but at the end he said ""If you have parents then be happy with them, I have one parent left and that is my mom, I wanted to spend more time with her""."
16606	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Does anyone else ever just come back to this video to listen to the greatest fighter of all time say his goodbye? I am happy I got to experience his domination.
16607	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He is only 29 and retired wtf man and everyone’s in the comments section called him a legend no he is not a legend. (stupid decision ever)🤣🤣🤣
16608	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Coward, never really fought anyone and only worried about retiring with a perfect record, the way he got the belt in itself is embarrassing, he got the belt cos the then-current champion had to pull out cos of injury and some nobody had to be called up in less than 24hrs notice, be real, he fought conor at the worst shape of his career, everyone in the world except him wanted a rematch but he retired before conor could be fit again
16609	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	3:08 Trevor Wittman's facial expression showing his love for the sport and athletes is a hidden gem I think
16610	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	The only thing I dislike about this is that Joe wasn’t the one to interview him on his retirement speech.
16611	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	"I completely disagree with Khabib that he has nothing else to prove. These are my issues with Khabib: 1. He had a total of 13 UFC fights in his entire career and defended his title only 3 times. 2. Of the fighters he fought, none of them were champions in their prime: He beat RDA before he had peaked, beat Conor after two years of inactivity (would have lost in 2015 against him), and beat Poirier and Gaethje who were weak contenders in an empty division. 3. He lost his fight to Tibau, who had 28 significant strikes to Khabib's 25, with a 32% landing rate compared to Khabib's 24%. 4. He ends his career with a total of 8 fights in the last 8 years, making him the least active champion in UFC history. After all, the rule is that you give up your title after one year of inactivity, so he did the absolute minimum to maintain his title and minimize possible losses. 5. His style is one of the lamest in the world because the UFC is meant to determine the best fighting style, but his strategy of pushing people into the fence and holding them there wouldn't work in a real street fight because his eyes would get poked out, so he's using some kind of cheap technicality to win fights with a fighting style that doesn't actually work in real life, defeating the entire purpose of the competition and why the UFC was started. 6. If he actually fought at the weight he walks around at of 185, he would lose to Israel Adesanya without much of a contest. 7. Even if he fought 15 pounds below his walk around weight and fought Kamaru Usman at 170 pounds, he would lose there too. 8. Khabib was brought up to avoid losses, and avoided fighting anyone like GSP or Anthony Pettis in 2014 to protect his record. 9. In the original days of UFC, to determine the best fighter in the world, Khabib wouldn't even be in the top 10 contenders, would get smashed, and no one would hear about him. Shrinking down to 155 pounds to fight small guys is an advantage that gives a special advantage to short guys like Khabib. Fighting a longer fighter like Jon Jones, he wouldn't stand a chance, even if both fought at 200 pounds, which would be easy for Khabib to make. 10. All in all, he feels like very much a paper tiger champion: a fighter brought up with barely any fights, who lost to Tibau, has a fighting style that doesn't work in real fights, who fought at an artificially low weight class with no good wrestlers or top contenders to be heavier than everyone else on fight night by 10 pounds, then vacated the title quickly to avoid losing. In the old days of the UFC, we never would have heard of Khabib because his approach only works at an artificially low weight class with no good wrestlers and he isn't actually as good a fighter as any of the big guys. Conclusion: Khabib Nurmagomedov barely fought, barely had any challenges, had a fighting style that doesn't work in the real world, ducked tough opponents, and fought at an artificially small and easy weight class because he would have been destroyed by real men. He is the most overrated fighter in UFC history, and did nothing to prove his greatness. Beating a 5'7"" guy by weighing 10 pounds more than him and pushing him into the fence doesn't show greatness of any kind: it just shows that he can beat small guys with a lame fighting style that doesn't even work in the real world."
16612	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib best lightweight yes, but P4P NO..., he only defened his title 3 times, also even bigger fact to this statement is that he simply never challenged himself with higher competition, I' ve mean on 170 pounds fight against Usman..., can't blame him tho, cause he knows this would be toughfest challenge for him by far.

16659	206	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	This fight was rigged from the start to favour kabob. Gathie is a sellout. They both have the same management and now the toarch is passed to the new champ
16660	207	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	A little douchey to demand best pound for pound “because I deserve it” but still the GOAT.
16661	208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	My grandma just passed away so came to see this again. I don't know. It is strangely comforting.
16662	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	3:43 look at how bloody and how much blood Khabib's right foot has lost. It happened when he put the triangle against the cage.In addition, he had already injured two toes on his left leg before fighting. Crazy
16663	210	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I'm actually happy that he retired because now his toxic casual fanbase will gradually dissipate and we as normal fans can have better conversations in the comments. But khabib is an amazing fighter though.
16664	211	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	It’s hard to break a man who has god on his side.
16665	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He has done all the hard work since he was a kid , now I just wish him happiness and peace and that he enjoys the rest of his life as the GOAT he is ♥️

16676	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Now I see why Khabib was going for a takedown against Conor, he can’t match Conor on his feet
16677	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	One of the saddest days of my life. I'm not american and I want to have a great job in my country. That position is very hard and this guy inspire me.
16678	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Not to hate but if he can’t fight without his father does that still make him the GOAT? I mean shouldn’t he be able to fight by himself?
16679	226	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Announcing retirement is good way to avoid usada till next fight . Btw Conor is looking huge now.....

16719	266	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	This man is a true Muslim. He spreads his religion through peace and love, not hatred and bloodshed. Do not let those evil terrorists make you believe otherwise: true Muslims will love their brother, for He made him in His perfect image. Perhaps he has been led astray, taken from his path of righteousness. But fear not, for in this life or the next, he will find his way. He is only being tested by Him, who wishes to watch him grow as a man and find his way on his own. I believe in the Buddha's teachings, personally, but I have nothing but love for practitioners of Islam. Just be sure not to lead yourself astray through misogyny or hate, because everyone, male or female, regardless of color, creed, nationality, religion, sexuality, or anything, is the work of Allah. With the help of faith in Him, whatever you may call him, we can find peace in our world.

I'm a simple guy from a regular village in the mountains of Dagestan, who came over here. Just yesterday my brother told me: ""According to Google you are the most discussed person on the planet"". I simply couldn't believe it, because if you can imagine, I never had any of this on my mind, it was just my father and I dreaming of becoming the champion one day. I could have never imagined so much could happen to me. If you have parents, be close to them, and that's it. I have only one parent left, my mother. I would like to dedicate more time to her""."

He has always been so polite to his opponent, well except in circumstances where the opponent act rude first. Maybe people who don't understand will question, why would you give up your career to take of mother etc and think of it as an axcuse but you see people have different priorities. And death of loved ones can do alot to you. You're one of the best fighters I've known Khabib

16767	314	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib may be a good fighter - but he is an radical islamist. Just today he threaten President Macron from France, said, god, Khabib called Allah, will punish him because of some drawings of Mohamed. What a poor and stupid religion is this, to support terrorist like the guy who beheaded a woman and killed two other in the name of god in a christian church? And Khabib takes money out of a christian pocket. How unpolitical and corrupt is Dana White, to let a person like Khabib, who is somehow nice, when he is talking to you, but who is probably at the same time, someone who is able to kill you and your beloved, just because he feels offended because of his god...

16824	371	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I don't think he's retiring. As much as I like him this is a classic trick to force UFC to put A LOT of money on the table for a fight against another future champion. He earned the right to pull that trick. Good for him.

16834	381	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	"Khabib's speech after the fight, translation from Russian: ""And now for my fans, and it would not be quite right to say ""to my fans from Russia"", so let's say ""to all Russian-speakers"", thank you so much, when I started all of this in 2008, and when I signed for UFC and had the first fight in 2012, many didn't believe in me, many thought it would be impossible. I'm a simple guy from a regular village in the mountains of Dagestan, who came over here. Just yesterday my brother told me: ""According to Google you are the most discussed person on the planet"". I simply couldn't believe it, because if you can imagine, I never had any of this on my mind, it was just my father and I dreaming of becoming the champion one day. I could have never imagined so much could happen to me. If you have parents, be close to them, and that's it. I have only one parent left, my mother. I would like to dedicate more time to her""."

I Did Not Knew That This Was Going To Be His Last Fight In The Ufc. But Now I Know. And Khabib Nurmagomedov, This Message Is For You. Dear Khabib Nurmagomedov, I Am So Sorry To Hear About Your Father Passing Away, And All Of The Situations About Your Father's Death. But Hopefully You Can Get Through That Situation. And You Made The Right Decision To Officially Retire From Mma Forever. Because You Are Getting Older, And You Need To Begin Thinking About Retirement. Even If The Fighter Had Worked So Hard To Win A Fight That You Needed To Get Back On The Winning Colum. But It Wasn't Enough. And You Are Thirty-Two Years Old My Brother. You Came To The Ufc At Age Twenty-Three. You Had Defeated Kamal Shalarous, Thiago Tavares, Michael Johnson, Edson Barboza, Ia Quinta, Conor Mcgregor, Dustin Poirier, And Justin Gaethje. You Had Defeated So Many Fighters. You Are A Hell Of A Beast. Nobody Could Ever Beat You. You Are Absolutely Amazing. And I Hope You Will Be In The Ufc Hall Of Fame This Christmas. Because That Will Be Your Christmas Present.

16846	393	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Retire because he’s afraid of connor
16847	394	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I understand that he's been labeled the number one PFP fighter now but that is definitely due to sympathy and somewhat of a parting gift for his retirement. Jon Jones is a far more rounded fighter with 12 more title defences. Emotions shouldn't affect official rankings
16848	395	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Bullshit. He made a deal and signed to fight in may next year.
16849	396	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He will come back soon or later, There will be a conor vs khabib 2 But we have to wait a long time for this

16851	398	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	He's disgraceful looking.
16852	399	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	One has to pay respects to an athlete of such skill, heart, commitment and humbleness. He’s reached the end of a long journey(?) From growing up and training in war-torn Dagestan, fighting in the streets to settle group conflicts to attaining a record of 29-0 in the UFC, with some of the best well-renowned fighters of this generation having been unable to truly decode what makes Khabib such a force of nature to be reckoned with. His tenacity and grit come from his experiences growing up in the time and place that he did and despite his surroundings, applying himself rigorously under his late father’s instruction to the art of fighting. A true champion through-and-through in both character and ability. If this is the end of the road as far as competing goes, it’s been more than a pleasure to watch this man take on and defeat all comers!💯💯🥇🏆
16853	400	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	I called my parents immediately after this and told them thank you and I love them.
16854	401	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib fought that fight with his dad on his mind and still excelled. That is something most fighters couldn't even dream of doing. You are an exceptional man khabib.
16855	402	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Hey khabib is 30-0,, remember his first opponent was e bear so he retired 30-0
16856	403	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Got so emotional watching this. This guy deserves it all. Such grace. So much respect.

16866	413	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HuTGeF5AA	Khabib’s speech after the fight, translation from Russian: “and now for my fans, and it would not be quite right to say ‘to my fans from Russia’, so let’s say ‘to all Russian speakers’, thank you so much, when I started all of this in 2008, and when I signed up for UFC and had the first fight in 2012, many didn’t believe in me, many thought it would be impossible. I’m a simple guy from a regular village in the mountain of Dagestan, who came over here. Just yesterday my brother told me: ‘according to Google, you’re the most discussed person on the planet’, I simply couldn’t believe it, because if you can imagine, I never had any of this on my mind, it was just my father and I dreaming of becoming a champion one day. I could never have imagined so much could happen to me. If you have parents, be close to them, and that’s it. I have only one parent left, my mother. I would like to dedicate more time to her”.

16938	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	It hurts that he can't even look up from the writing. He had to separate himself from the situation, and just read what he wrote, it was too painful. I really don't like seeing the happy, nice, and kind people we all know to be in pain like this. Its like watching Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey in true pain.. they are supposed to be the happy and lovable people in the world, and to see them broken is breaking a part of you as well. Shaq is too good of a person to endure such a hardship. The world sucks.
16939	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I literally expected Kobe to get up and walk out of that wreckage.
16940	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Shaq is like the Paul McCartney of the lakers, aging and always thinking of Kobe while Kobe is John Lennon. A duo that we will forever miss. RIP Mamba

16966	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	The fact that people disliked the video is just straight disrespectful
16967	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Who’s here after Kobe died?
16968	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	1:47 that men looked like kobe!!
16969	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Shaq by his own admission last saw Kobe when he dropped 60 that was 4 years ago you were that busy? Is that your idea of staying in touch? Kobe's parents weren't dismissed they were in attendance whatever the problems were between Kobe and his parents well documented It wasn't about them remember they sold his stuff
16970	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Kobe didn't die, he just faded away...
16971	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	You can tell that Shaq is deeply hurt. It's showing in his weight, eyes, and slurring speech. He's a gentle giant with a giant heart. He works a lot and puts others before himself. Kobe was always looking out for Shaq's kids, and that meant so much to Shaq. His kids are hurting as much as he is, so he's carrying an even heavier load. I honestly hope that people watch out for him. He needs the rest as much as anyone connected to this awful tragedy.
16972	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	The old man at 4:00 didn't hear what he said that was so funny, the guys next to him says just laugh.

16980	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Hey guys I just started a YouTube channel please give it a watch if you wouldn’t mind and sub if you like my vids ! Have a good day x
16981	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Why does everyone keep saying “I’m glad they mentioned his parents”. His parents and Kobe had a bad relationship. They CHOOSE not to be mentioned. They choose not to speak. They didn’t want to. Accept it. This is a reflection of the life they choose after rejecting his wife, rejecting his marriage and disrespecting their marriage. Death don’t change reality. Kobe’s dad can call for a conference and there isn’t one news media that wouldn’t come to listen or host him. His mother too. They are choosing to stay in the background. I’m SURE she asked for them to be mentioned. I’m sure she asked for them to speak. Vanessa lost her Husband. Vanessa lost her daughter. She’s not thinking about being petty. God bless his parents. But perhaps this teaches us all to value one another and stop being petty. She was married to this man for 20 years! They need to get over it. If Kobe was my son I would of been on like 50 shows already bragging about his legacy doing the ugly cry. I would be all over telling the world about his work and charity. Securing his legacy. If I were his mom nothing can keep me clapping back at idiots like Gayle and Oprah for dragging him after his death but avoiding the real serial rapist like Harvey. Man please. Stop hinting it’s Vanessa when his own mom was just trying to sell his high school memorabilia for a bigger house. This woman stayed with him while he cheated— and she had no prenup. She could of easily walked away with half. When they got married they he no prenup. Another reason why their family was mad. But they never ever stopped being petty and nasty. Black Women ( i am a black woman) are really mad as biased because he’s a black man with a non-black woman. It’s ridiculous. You really think Vanessa BANNED them from speaking and they were treated badly? Yah right. They would speak to the press! You really think that his sisters, his mom, and even his dad wouldn’t hold a press conference?? They made their choices as parents. It’s the parents who are grimy. Regardless—- you just lost your husband. You just lost your daughter— and you can’t put your differences aside to comfort her and be there for her and your grandkids??? Your grandkids just lost their parent?? And their sister?!? Look at them sitting separate. I’m SURE as hell its not Vanessa as she’s barely able to hold it together losing her daughter and her husband in one go. This is the way they always acted. They never came to his game. Not even his retirement game. They never came to his awards or mvps. Never. This is just how they are. They allowed money to be an issue to divide them.

17014	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Everyone forgets to mention that Kobe was also a talented rapper. He released a song called K.O.B.E. , man could do it all.

17027	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Thank God, Shaq had the heart to not disregard Kobe's parents and siblings. He even fist bumped those cute little twin looking boys who were with the parents. Exodus 20:12 will never be obsolete. Despite their obvious differences, I'm praying for forgiveness, supernatural bonding, and healing to come to fruition with the entire family of Kobe Bryant. God bless them all.
17028	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	@4:00 guy on the right didn't get the joke and guy on the left said just laugh.
17029	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Thank you Shaq for being classy enough to mention his parents and sisters! It was the human thing to do.

I am thankful to those that have mentioned the others, just wished more would.
17031	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	877 dislikes, 877 people who won't forget the 7 no-names who died with him. R.I.P everyone who died in the crash, I haven't forgotten you, when everyone else seems to.

17042	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I wasn't there nor saw a full version of the ceremony. What I have seen is great tributes and condolences to Kobe's wife and family (and the other families of people who died). I'm curious about one thing....and this comes from my dislike of how celebrities continue to bring politics into places it doesn't belong (i.e. Pitt at the Oscars): Did Kimmel abuse the ceremony and attack Trump or the Republicans in any way?
17043	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	The Big Fella has a way with words❤️❤️❤️💯
17044	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Why is Kimmel here? God, I cant get away from this shitbag

17046	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Off subject but just curious what are those glass window things for?
17047	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	sucks that kobe left knowing his parents still had a bad relationship with him

Jesus Christ Will Be The Judge. ""Repent"" Before It's Too Late."
17049	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	My friend passed away recently, and somehow Shaquille saying these words comforts me, also. Very well said.
17050	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	It's very sad that koby and his daughter died, but why cant we give a little recognition to the other people who died on that horrible day
17051	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	The details man, perfect speech, not too long, didn't talk about himself, even at the end when he holds up his hand and due to his size accidently smacks the teleprompter....this whole speech is all Shaq...his essence, love it.
17052	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	He dead get over it losers
17053	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	i didn’t ask
17054	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Kobe-Shaq Lakers Era was one of the best teams in the 21st century.
17055	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Did anyone acknowledge this man's Parents?? Didn't they PAVE the way for him??
17056	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Pretty Crazy Kobe's retired numbers 8 + 24 GiGi's 2 = Shaq's 34
17057	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	This is getting kinda old now, death is just a part of the life cycle everyone gotta go through it rip 🙏🏻
17058	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	His speech was best and then MJ. I read a quote somewhere and it goes “a wife that looses a husband is a widow a husband that looses a wife is a widower, a child that looses a parent is an orphan, but there is no word for a parent that looses a child, because the pain is unimaginable.” So when Shaq mentioned his parents it made my heart smile, before he was anything he was a son. It saddens me to see his own wife not mention the parents. Also she lost a child and when she spoke of her, her emotions were more raw then when she spoke of her husband, so she should understand that they also lost a child and a grandchild. Anyways speech was amazing, I wish this memorial honored all of the deaths. Rest In Peace to all of the people and I pray for the ones left behind who have to live with this sadness.
17059	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	"""I guess so, Kobe, I don't know how to play chess."""
17060	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I feel truly sorry for Kobe's parent's my condolences to his family. But vanessa i can't co-sign on what she did. Let the past stay in the past about his parent's. Not even women enough to be the bigger person. Smh.. Great job Shaq💔💪
17061	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Glad to see Vanessa laughing after Shaq's joke
17062	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	whoever genuinely disliked this video has no heart
17063	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	The fact that Shaq mentioned kobe's parent and make Vanessa smile this is a good and a goal speech 👌🏾👍💔🙏🙏🙏 RIP mamba RIP GiGi and the others wo past 🙏💔
17064	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Why did shack curse like that GOD doesn't like that disrespect
17065	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	"Shack is a freemason (he shows off his ring a lot) are they in league with coby's ""boules"" society? I remember seeing coby doing hand signs (satanic ones but old and tried and true) but cannot figure out if he was a freemason as well. They never tire of getting attention and money from the plebs who slavishly support them."
17066	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Shaq cares about kobe and so many commenters on here seem to care about shaq but he doesn't care about you. He is a Master 33 degree Mason that worships the devil and wants depopulation so keep on idolizing him.
17067	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Love how he mentioned his parents as well!
17068	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I can’t understand this part. 3:51 There’s not I in team (I got it) But there’s an Emmy?
17069	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	What a great speech Shaw and was so great how he put some humor into such a sad moment. And so happy that he acknowledged Kobe’s parents and sisters! Shaq you’re one hell of a guy!
17070	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I’ve been to a lot of funerals... 1st time I heard the words “M***F***..”.
17071	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	This is why I love shaq. He had the class to mention Kobe parents and other immediate family. I mean regardless of Kobe and his parents fall out. His mother did carry him for 9 months and his dad was one who put a basketball in his crib. At least acknowledge them for that.
17072	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	loved that shaq also acknowledged kobe's family including his mom and dad,sisters and nephews that's real....
17073	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	The way this hurts feels like I personally knew them
17074	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	"""I guess so Kobe I don't know how to play chess."" Kobe, you really were in a different league. You are an inspiration."

17076	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Shaq never disappoints. Well, with the possible exception of from the freethrow line.
17077	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Vanessa was very disrespectful not to acknowledge his parents. This chic never had to work a day in her life because of the wonderful human being they produced. Kobe would do anything for her she said, why didn't she insist in a reconcialition????It was heartless of her not to try and heal this rift but used him to take care of her whole family. Selfish!
17078	174	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Scientists need to rename the actual Black Mamba Snake, the Kobe Snake, out of respect.
17079	175	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Shaq’s speech is the best speech ever. He acknowledged kobe’s parents and sisters. And other family members of the other souls on board. Bless you shaq.
17080	176	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	For once somebody mentioned his parents and siblings.

17083	179	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I know Kobe's dad is taking it so hard. That was his friend that was his only son. He taught him to be the great man, husband, and father he was. I can only imagine his pain.
17084	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	"I""m so thankful and happy he acknowledged his parents and sister, it really bothered me that nothing was honored about them in any pictures or expression as if he wasn't a son and a brother.

17085	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Omg I Lol and cried so nice to see Vanessa and Nathalia laughing that’s what kobe would 💕
17086	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Shaq acknowledged his entire family and that was awesome

17089	185	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	This passing came 9 days after the passing of my baby brother. Already being deep in mourning this hit so different. My heart continues to break for his wife and the lost of Gigi is gut wrenching. I cried like a baby for days for the family, my brother, my family. Smh.. Like most I never met Kobe but, my respect and admiration for him is so deep I prayed and asked God if he would ask Kobe to look out for my little brother in heaven. RIP Babybro, Kobe, Gigi and those other families who suffered a great lost.❤

17097	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Am I the only one that noticed that Shaq was the only speaker that gave his condolences to Kobe's parents or did I miss something? Just an observation 🤷🏾‍♂️ R.I.P. To ALL that passed in that horrific accident 🙏🏾
17098	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	SHAQ mentioned Kobe was also LOVING SON AND BROTHER!! WERE THEY THREATENED IF THEY MENTIONED HIS PARENTS AND SISTERS?
17099	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	"That ""And I promise I will not teach them my free throw techniques"" omg"

17105	201	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	The Buss family should've said a few words.
17106	202	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Legends never die .
17107	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I like how Shaq gave condolences to Kobe parents and his sisters.
17108	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	kyrie put lebron and cleveland on his back against a great team, a better team. the made the greatest comeback in sports history and made the clutch walk off picture perfect dagger respect that man stop hating. kobe saw it we all did. why you thinkmkd said come on bro. i hope they both get healthy for a full 2021

17112	208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Kobe, and even more so the young Gigi, are the only strangers for whom I’ve ever shed tears. Not only for who they were, but also for the endless potential what they could be and the change they would’ve brought to this world.
17113	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I thoroughly enjoyed watching Kobe and Shaq! This really breaks my heart💔💔💔
17114	210	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Shaq: Kobe there’s no “I” in team Kobe: I know but there’s an “M” & “E” in that m******😂😂😂🥺 You will be missed Kobe & Gigi
17115	211	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	The man is a giant,but soft as a teddy bear..❤🧡💛💛
17116	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	3:47 Kobe let Shaq know that there's a M-E in that Muthafuka!
17117	213	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Love that he mentioned Lennon and McCartney. Brothers forever, make you better! Love Shaq!
17118	214	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Where was Charles Barkley to show support SMH.
17119	215	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I miss Kobe. I also love shaq. Man the world really took an L this year.
17120	216	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Shaq made Vanessa laugh. Good job!
17121	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Once again Shaq's tribute is one of the best.on point...(i guess he's the only one who mentioned abt Kobe as a son &brother)!
17122	218	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	"""Just get the rebound, he's not passing""."
17123	219	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	They were like Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Connor together....brother have their tough times but the ones who love each other grieve for one another. Shaq is Kobe's brother. Much respect to them both.
17124	220	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	3: 45 there is a me lol
17125	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Y’all need to move on
17126	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	What did he say the words that had been muted ?
17127	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	24&2
17128	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I love how Kyrie couldn't bring himself to even smile during the any of the jokes. Same as during Jordan's speech. Exactly how I'm feeling.
17129	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Powerful. The pain he's feeling is so tangible.
17130	226	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Yeah sorry Jordan and pippen are better than shaq and Kobe
17131	227	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	Still can't believe it! Will forever remember where I was when I first heard the news.. Still makes me sick to my stomach..
17132	228	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fqYgNR6174	I love Kobe and I'm so sad. RIP MAMBA+MAMBACITA.

17135	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	I love how Dana always holds them back, as if he's actually capable of single handedly holding any one of them back if they really wanted to fight
17136	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Anderson killed every face off, his energy hits different
17137	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	2:46 Funny af Rose is talking like she's mentioning some verse on a bible. Or a song lyrics she memorized
17138	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Aldo fans still waiting for a W since this match.
17139	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	3:05 Joe be like “what the fk is up with his face ?” 😂
17140	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	I don’t care what anyone says I love Cody Garbrandt man... He was destroying people before he started getting reckless
17141	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Too bad we didn’t see at least a couple of rounds of Aldo vs Conor, would’ve even interesting
17142	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	While watching Cejudo I thought he was gonna evolve
17143	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	0:51 that was good self-control from Chael.
17144	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	That preacher's daughter took soul from the ronda rousey body.
17145	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Adesanya vs Whittaker and Zhang vs Joanna should’ve been included
17146	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Finally, someone set UFC faceoffs to 80s porno music. All my dreams have come true.
17147	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	I love Holly. She ended ronda's ufc career
17148	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Im surprised Cruz didn’t injure himself during both of those face offs
17149	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	The music makes this hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
17150	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	0:28 GAWD MIESHA IS BAAAAAAD
17151	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Aldo looked so calm and cool at weigh ins what a shame he let his emotions threw his gameplay out of window
17152	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Just to mention: All this fights were amazing
17153	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Honestly, I don’t know what’s better, the stare downs or Joe Rogan’s reaction🤔
17154	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Joe Rogan watches staredowns the same way I watch porn
17155	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	"1:55 one of the best Even dana was like: ""Robbie holy shit"""
17156	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Tony Ferguson is the type of dude to faceoff with his mirror reflection
17157	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	In the first face off, Aldo try to imitate McGregor's pose right?
17158	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Rogan at 1:22 you can tell he just ate an edible and is living his life
17159	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Conor looked like a drained zombie in that staredown with Aldo.
17160	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	U know the ufc is running out of ideas when they aren’t even showing fights
17161	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	You can see how much Dana White really loves what he does, Like obviously he can easily pay someone to be the muscle between the two fighters yet he still does it all
17162	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Lmao why is Nunes vs Pennington included. Lmao that fight held no meaning to UFC history
17163	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Tf is wrong with Cejudo Mr Cringe is on drugs or something
17164	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Anderson shoulder never be the same.. goat sonnen break his shoulder with his chin..
17165	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Do one for inside the octagon! For example, the one between Covington and Usman was badass.
17166	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	The Lawler and MacDonald faceoff seems so much more intense when you think about the fight they had
17167	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Sonnen didn’t even flinch. Never lost a round or face off
17168	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	UFC face-offs, disco edition?
17169	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	little did silva know that chael has a killer spinning backfist
17170	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	The aldo conor faceoff was longer than the fight
17171	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Seriously, all want this fight .. Tony Ferguson Vs Conor McGregor Tony Ferguson Vs Nat Diaz
17172	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX2gun7KRfQ	Conor learned that shoulder strike from Anderson

17176	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Herb Dean is an amazing referee. He cares so much about the health of the fighters. He dives in there and shields the KO'd/TKO'd fighters with his own body whenever necessary. True professional.
17177	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The Reyes knockout is on my top list. His soul literally left his body.
17178	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	What is with all the hitting when someone is down? Either you knocked them out or you didn't, don't jump on someone who's already down let them get up if they can.
17179	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	MIKE TYSON WOULD HAVE GONE UNDERNEATH THAT SHOT AND COUNTERED WITH A HOOK. FUCK! @ 0:01 SEC.
17180	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	He let Masvidal take more shots than needed before calling that fight. That was one of the most movie-like knockouts of all time, he was clearly out when he dropped.
17181	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Never understood why would you still be punching a totally blacked out opponent laying on the floor defenseless.
17182	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The hammer fists instead of showmanship are disgusting.
17183	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I hate this game.. bloody game ,It should be banned
17184	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	pervert sport for pervert people
17185	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Sorry, hammering a fist on an opponent who is on the floor is not a sport. This is fun for the uneducated.
17186	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I watch like rocky movies when stallone get punch the sweat comes out. Thanks kamaru usman you make movies become real life and not bullshit
17187	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	BORING.... Makes me miss the old days
17188	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Damn Edgar was ASLEEP the moment that knee crushed his face!! Extremely IMPRESSIVE
17189	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	honest question: why do most fighters keep throwing punches on heads while the opponent is clearly KO? It's a sport, right?
17190	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	My top 3 are: 1. Sandman’s Flying Knee 2. Jiri’s spinning elbow of doom 3. Usman baptism of gamebred
17191	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	UFC is brutal lol, they could careless if you die in the octagon. All they care about is the money.
17192	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	"Fantastic sales job by Joe Rogan on the ""KO"" by Usman over Masvidal, the fight looked a little sus back then, and always everyone's an expert with hindsight, but what really seals the deal is what has happened in the UFC since then. All of the fights, or probably practically all of the fights in UFC - ARE NOW STARTING TO CLOSELY RESEMBLE - ROCK N ROLL WRESTLING, YOU KNOW - THIS IS WAR, RAW IS WAR, WWF OR WWE. The ""knock-out"" of Jorge was absolutely CHOREOGRAPHED, everything looked a little out-of-whack, there was the excessive amount of water put into Jorge's hair, also he seemingly very uncharacteristically, plants his feet in a certain spot, then he turns his head, turns his chin, in exactly the same direction, the very straight right punch, almost labored, although with some power, it only really sort of glances Jorge's face, it was never a ""blunt impact punch"" - it was more glancing, causing the braided Jorge (who had never been KO'd in his entire MMA career) to turn his head, turn the entire angle of his body, and stance, his head pivoting away from the punch, and of course, the soaking job on his hairdo, flying water droplets spectacularly, and his body falling, almost like collapsing onto itself, and then the little slap hammer fists, to get check-mates. Joe Rogan selling ice to Eskimo's. Note: UFC used to put on war's back in the day, nowday's there are more slaps and backhanders than Andre the Giant ever did in his whole career, this ""recent phenomenon"" has taken hold of the UFC, where even World Title Fights are little more than a pleasant sparring session. The greed-hooks have devoured the majority of the purse, they give the fighters THE SMALLEST CUT - OF ANY PROFESSIONAL SPORT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, much much smaller in fact, where NBL, NFL, Baseball, NHL give their players around 60-70% of the budget, the UFC pays a tight-fisted, limp-wristed, smoke and mirrors misted 19% - the fighters dissed, rissed and pissed, they have gone to negotiate a better deal, knowing the damage of the sport - BUT THE UFC MANAGEMENT HEADED BY THE BALD-HEADED ROGAN, SAID NO-WAY, KEEP YOUR GOOD LOOKS, AND GO GET SOME ACTING CLASSES. YOU CAN ALWAYS SLOT STRAIGHT INTO HOLLYWOOD AFTER RETIREMENT, JUST LIKE DWAYNE JOHNSON DID. IN THE MEANTIME, LEAVE THE SALES JOB TO ME, I'LL TURN A FAIRY TAP INTO A GODZILLA THUNDER SLAP."
17193	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I think fighting is bad, only animals fight, wish i never watched this
17194	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I love how Masvidal was so confident he could beat Usman, even tried to fight the guy outside the ring, and then BOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!
17195	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	"""A man that calls himself a fighter, knowing he wasn't blessed by God with knockout power? I don't know how he could live like that."" Masvidal speaking about Usman before their fated fight."
17196	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Reyes lost that fight but earned my respect. He was getting tagged with a bunch of great shots but never gave up
17197	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	5 seconds in and some dickhead hammer fisting a k.o.ed opponent, trash.
17198	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	A sport where, when one man is down, the other still punches him, it's not a sport, it's just any street fight. I really do not like it!
17199	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Everyone talks about how great that sandbagging Sandhagen knee was. The dude is 5’11 and knees a guy who’s 5’6 and everyone Loses thier damn Minds..that’s crap.
17200	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Cant respect usman or Francis at all for slamming a man in the face on the ground when you already know he is out cold.
17201	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The fact that stipe recovered from the first haymaker is absolutely amazing. Ngannou is fucking terrifying
17202	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	UFC is stupit
17203	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	hate Rose
17204	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	"Sure Usman, Diaz, McGregor are pretty ""tough"", but rest assured none of them stand a CHANCE against ANYONE in the comments..."
17205	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Superman Flying knee 3:00
17206	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	1:19 this is disgusating he is down this is not needed to finish total disrespect awful
17207	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Dude Masvidal got his fucking world rocked. That was one of the squarest prettiest knock outs you'll ever see. That snapped his neck bro. I am a fan of Masvidal but bro that had to hurt. Night night
17208	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The way Herb dean ran to stop that usman masvidal fight makes me laugh 😂
17209	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Even if you don’t like Mazvidal, you gott respect him mannning up and taking that loss with respect to Usman. He admitted that Usman got the better of him and won that fight.
17210	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jiri is a SCARY man, not just his fight game, but he is just a legit scary looking man
17211	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	As good as Rose’s kick was, the best part of that knockout was Pat Barry losing his mind on the side of the cage after the KO 😂
17212	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Watching Usman twist Masvidal's head around like The Exorcist will always put a smile on my face.
17213	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The Edson KO was the most I've been afraid for a fighter in the cage in a while. That late reaction was scary AF.
17214	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman still suks
17215	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Ngannou definitely improved but stipe seemed more hesitant than usual. Ngannou is a monster though
17216	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal getting humbled is what we’ve Ben Askren for.
17217	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The way francis brings that hammer fist down from the clouds like Zeus
17218	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	"""He's out cold... You see him trying to get up"" He wasn't out cold then Joe."
17219	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Rose is an absolute WEAPON! All of these knockouts made my mouth hurt just from watching them ha!
17220	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	1:54 is my personal favorite, that was a sneaky ass kick timed to perfection. I picked her to win by KO in the 2nd, she exceeded that expectation in dramatic fashion. Usman sleeping Masvidal was a downer, didn't want either of them to lose as I like them both. I also knew the shitstorm that was coming Masvidal's way and I'd never wish that on anybody.
17221	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Literally why does everyone who gets a knockout go in for extra hits like their gonna get up after getting knocked?😅
17222	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I’ll never get tired of watching masvidal’s soul leave his body.
17223	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Pro fighters are considered weapons. I'm not a pro fighter so I wouldn't fight a pro fighter without a weapon 🗡🔫. I would advise a pro fighter to keep there hands to themselves when dealing with me...there's a reason don king dominated the fighters her promoted.
17224	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	It's really sad to see what happened to Reyes after that definite win he had over Jones. I really wished he was gonna be the next goat. Kinda the same thing that happened to Conor after the Alvarez fight.
17225	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Miocic Vs Ngannou fight had me sad but I was also very excited for ngannou… it was so conflicting
17226	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	4:43 I can honestly say I’ve never seen a delayed reaction like this to getting rocked in my life. 😂
17227	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jorge: laughing and smiling Usman: 👊🏿 Jorge: what happened?
17228	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Imagine thinking MMA is a sport rather than just prize fighting. Still fun to watch though.
17229	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	"I'm not really a fan of fighters that hit people who are clearly knocked out, but I usually just shrug it off most of the time because of the whole ""Blah blah downed fighter could recover so keep fighting till the ref says so blah blah"". However, wtf is wrong with Ngannou?? The dude literally raised his fist as high as possible to get maximum force to hammerfist a dude who is clearly not defending himself. That shit just shows a weak will if you ask me. Getting so caught up in his anger that he can't hold back from hitting someone who is clearly out of the fight."
17230	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Miocic: ight let’s turn this shit up a bit Ngannou: JAB 😭😭😭
17231	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	4:09 Those are some lethal elbows man, that was savage!
17232	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I don't get this whole smack them while they are on the floor. Not disciplined not skilful and if you didn't hit them hard enough to knock them down on the first punch then you have to keep on fighting
17233	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Weili's stoppage was too early. She was the champion, she should've been given a few more seconds. Rose's hammer fists weren't that dangerous, and Weili was conscious. She should have a chance to defend herself, even if it took her a couple of seconds.

17247	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman on all the PEDs!
17248	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	How can you knock someone clean out, then hammer down on his head 5 more times when he is lying on the floor unconscious and call that a sport?
17249	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I never get tired of watching Masvidal get his ass knocked TFO! Maybe he’ll learn a bit of humility.
17250	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The patience from both of them was crazy, but Ngannou as soon as Miocic reset his stance Ngannou was on him 🙏

17259	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal: smiles Usman: you’re smiling? Masvidal: yup Usman: oh okay Masvidal: *confused gurgling sounds*

17265	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Make note of the fighters that continue when the opponent is clearly knocked out, hands down, defenseless and the fighters who stop knowing there's no need to follow up. There's a VERY clear trend. A very clear common denominator.
17266	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I Love seeing Masvidal being reminded that he's human lol
17267	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	God I hate when they are so obviously slept and then they take big hits to their unconscious face lol like it would be way cooler looking to just let em drop..like this 2:55
17268	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Crazy how masival got caught like that he never been caught like that
17269	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	why the brutality continues if someone is already knocked down...
17270	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal is a good fighter but he never respects his opponents so Usman gave him a proper etiquette lesson. He'll think next time before he smiles his opponent's move.
17271	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman uses the same moves my wife does when trying to kill a roach
17272	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I love how they show masvidal being ko’d twice, once in the beginning and once in the end😂😂😂
17273	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal let all his fan’s down by playing around in his 2nd title fight in a year, we don’t know why he was doing that on he’s highest peak of career if he fought seriously we might have different and better fight 😔
17274	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal getting obligated is still so gratifying
17275	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Stipe was way too light in the ass to fight a perfectly tuned and conditioned Francis.

17282	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	1:55 that kick was lighting fast. I'm not a huge UFC fan, but this made me think what world class really means.
17283	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Love seeing masvidal get fucked up
17284	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	261 was one for the books man, so many classic fights with great finishes
17285	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	3:54 literally the cleanest spinning elbow ive ever seen
17286	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	It's absolutely exceptional how long Stipe survived though, he took an insane amount of power punches and didn't fall. He's still the king of heavyweights in my opinion.

17295	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I like how we see masvidal get knocked out twice. It’s like a reminder of “Btw this happened.”
17296	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	what utterly idiotic hear style on the guy at 3:23. Its like he comes with a handle to carry him around with.

17299	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	0:52 what no one noticed is that Miocic hits Ngannou in the face, which makes him back off slightly, swaying a little. I recommend setting it at 0.25 speed. Of course it's not something very significant but that demonstrated that the Cameroonian is not unbeatable standing.
17300	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	4:40 god damn he needs better internet, that’s like a 200ms ping
17301	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Its sooo satisfying seeing Masvidal got those “super necessary” shots 🤣🤣🤣

17307	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Francis is so slow...
17308	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I really like Prochazka. He's got that wild unpredictable quality and he's not afraid to come through his opponents power shots so he can land his own shots in devastating combinations. Looking forward to seeing him in action again.

There’s a lot of other amazing female fighters that I like to watch, but Rose has the “it” factor that draws me in and won’t let go.
17317	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Its crazy to see Ngannou here, considering how the UFC acts like he didn't fight this year at all.
17318	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	If Usman continues on this part,he definitely will eclipse GSP.
17319	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman's KO of Masvidal is the most perfect straight shot I've seen since Henderson KO'd Bisping.
17320	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Pretty crazy how Burgos was literally knocked out but managed to resist it and acted like nothing happened until his body shut down.
17321	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	0:42 And Francis is gonna be careful to not load up.

17324	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal should handover his BMF title !!
17325	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Gotta love seeing Masvidal's big ol' grin seconds before winning a one-way trip to the shadow realm.

17329	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	That Masvidal knockout was so satisfying.
17330	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Massive respect to Stipe and Reyes for going forward even after taking those massive shots.
17331	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Every knockout: appreciation for the fighter who timed the finish but sad to see another human go down like that with worries about their future health! Brutal sport 👊🏻
17332	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	How fucking sick would it be to see Jiri vs Jon Jones? He reminds me of a super young and ready Jon Jones. Holllyyyyyyy smokes.
17333	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Kamaru usmans knockout was satisfying he literally restarted madvidals systems after knocking him out 😌👌
17334	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Should've had McGregor getting knocked out
17335	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	can someone please explain to me what happened in barboza vs burgos fight?? it looked like he was fine
17336	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Brandon Moreno finishing figgy and capturing the title is definitely my top moment of 2021
17337	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Where is Dustin knocking out the leprechaun?
17338	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Dumb video, Weili or whatever her name is wasn't knocked out, that Burges guy also wasn't knocked out. I get that maybe you had to add a woman's fight for other reasons, however that Burges vs Barboza wasn't a KO and you should have not included it, instead you should have had Lewis KOing Blaydes in there. Additionally another one you should have added was the the O'Mally vs Thomas Almeida.
17339	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I don't know who's watched Street Judas getting KO'd more me or Ben Askren lol love it
17340	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	These are some insane knockouts, but finishes should include submissions as well. Paul Craig comes to mind
17341	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Doesn’t seem like the ufc is protecting Conor’s image at all.
17342	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	"In 2019 Jorge was in the thumbnail of every ""best UFC ko"" video being made. Two years on and he's in the thumbnail again, but on the opposite end of the ko. How things change...."
17343	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman’s has to be the most impressive considering who he did it against. I bet if you told anyone leading up to the fight that he would knockout a ko artist like Masvidal, they wouldn’t believe you.
17344	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	O’Malley’s finish over Thomas was one of the most vicious knockouts Ive seen
17345	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal: I've been having trouble falling asleep lately. Usman: I can help.
17346	171	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	So sad Reyes has to go through two huge killers and suffer two KO losses back to back; would have been better if he had won the belt against Jones and lost his defense. Those Jones judges really did him bad. He can only keep dreaming about the belt now
17347	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The Usman and Thug Rose knockouts were on the same card, if you didn't remember. It was the best main card i've EVER seen. It was all finishes, and the one that wasn't got fight of the night I think
17348	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Watching Stipe get folded like that breaks my heart 😭😭
17349	174	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	is everyone gonnaa ignore the fact they put masvidals twice lol

17356	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Dang I never realized how badly Reyes landed on his head after that KO. Look at his neck when he lands. Yikes.
17357	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usually a flying knee lands on a fighter who is trying to take his opponent down but Frankie wasn't even looking for the takedown, Cory just flew out of nowhere and landed that knee.
17358	183	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Man so satisfying to see Usman smack the arrogance out of his opponents. First Covington, now Masvidal.
17359	184	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	2:53 ahh mannn sad seeing that.... but Cory might be future champ
17360	185	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	When Stipe landed one punch in that fight, it really must have pissed off ngannou. That hammer fist was Ngannou’s way of saying, “how dare you”
17361	186	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jiri is the most exciting fighter I have ever seen
17362	187	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	God bless Jiri. The guy is so exciting to watch.
17363	188	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman silencing the Pro-Masvidal crowd was incredible

17365	190	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Hard to get more satisfying then that Usman KO, Masvidal was such a prick leading up to that
17366	191	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jiri beat Dom in a way that we rarely see. his face looked like ortegas face when max put on that clinic

17368	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Knockout so good, UFC can't control putting it at the starting and at the end of the video.
17369	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Even though he’s lost 3 in a row, I gotta admit I was wrong about Dominick Reyes. Anyone who can take that kind of abuse and keep throwing heat deserves everyone’s respect. Absolute warrior. 🦾
17370	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	No matter what happens the rest of the year I can't imagine usman's KO being outside the top 3 of the year..
17371	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	They're all AMAZING...so gonna break it down. 1. Most Picturesque - Usman 2. Most Painful Looking - Prochazka 3. Best Technical - Rose 4. Saddest to Watch - Sandhagen 5. Craziest - Edson 6. Already Knew The Results Before The Fight Even Happened - Francis
17372	197	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	If you haven't done so go look up Jiri's mma record and look at how many of his fights end in KOs/TKOs. It's insane.

17374	199	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman's KO was so violent they put it twice on the list
17375	200	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jiri violently knocking out Reyes with that spinning back elbow, one of the greatest KOs imo
17376	201	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Yes you don’t mention Conor McQuitter’s nap time? Bias!
17377	202	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Dude... I still can’t get over the war that was Dom vs Jiri. I feel for Dom man he fought like a true warrior hopefully he bounces back but damn Jiri is like the terminator
17378	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Derrick Lewis’ knockout over Curtis Blaydes should be on here. That was one of the most brutal knockouts!
17379	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman has two of the most satisfying wins in ufc history. Even crazier that they were both finishes 👏👏👏
17380	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Oliveira vs Chandler, Lewis vs Blaydes, Volkov vs Overeem, Poirier vs McGregor
17381	206	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Francis with the unnecessary hammer fist
17382	207	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Ngannou walked into a right hand from Stipe, right on the chin, and he ate it like a TicTac UFO candy.
17383	208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Damn all these 2021 title fights are 🔥
17384	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman's fist literally caused it to rain inside the octagon...SHEESH 👀😈🔥
17385	210	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	What about connor getting knocked the fuck out?
17386	211	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The crowd makes everything better. If you disagree you're wrong and thats okay.
17387	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Oliveira KO should be there, not only was it beautiful, it was so unexpected not only for Charles background but also because of round 1
17388	213	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	usman's probably at about 60% now He's not even in his final form
17389	214	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal getting baptized is the best thing this year, out with the fake bmf
17390	215	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	That Usman finish is one of the craziest Knockouts EVER. So unexpected the way he KOs a dude who usually puts guys to sleep, the way the first fight went while Masvidal was on short notice. Usman just continues to show his greatness can’t wait to see him fight again 🔥🔥🔥
17391	216	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Sandhagen's KO on Frankie Edgar is my personal favorite.
17392	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	HOW IN THE FUCK IS POIRIER KO OVER CONOR NOT ON HERE. It's so fucking annoying how the UFC caters Conor's nuts.
17393	218	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	You can see Masvidals participation belt in his corner when he gets knocked out lol
17394	219	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	We all know if Connor wasn't fighting next weekend the Poirier January knockout would've been on this list. I guess theyre selling the fight by hoping people forget about that.
17395	220	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	How the fuck does someone's goes to sleep after a punch
17396	221	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Broke my heart to see Frankie get turned off like that
17397	222	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Most surprising: Usman Most epic: Sandhagen Most inspiring: Namajunas Most WTF: Barbosa
17398	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The way Masvidal was clowning Usman the whole fight and then got 3 pcs and a soda was one of the most satisfying k.o. I've watched so far...
17399	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	That Cory KO is so underrated imo bc he not big like the other stars in this video but also bc it was like in Feb so kinda far time from now especially with the crazy KOs we been getting recently. All i got to say is wow, cory KO thats a piece of art right there
17400	225	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	O’Malley should be on this for sure!
17401	226	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jiri Prochazka is the 205 version of Tony Ferguson. Gets hit too much and will get finished by a technical striker.
17402	227	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I wonder why Conor isn’t on here🤔
17403	228	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal being KOd and put in the highlight video is so satisfying, all we need is Israel Adesanya to be slept and 2021 is a great year
17404	229	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I love how everyone was more hyped about Ngannous finish more so then the fact that he is now champion, Everyone knew that he was going to become champ. He must be proud
17405	230	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	If That *B.M.F Title Fight* Had Been Anywhere Else *Besides New York* .. #Nate Would Have *Finished* #Masvidal In The *Last Two Rounds* (Guaranteed) .. & He Fought #Jorge With An *Injured Knee* .. & *Only 75 Days After Beating* #Pettis #WarDiaz .. The *Real B.M.F*
17406	231	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Cmom dude, the ko of charles on chandler it's better ko of edson over burgos
17407	232	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	You mean to tell me the Poirier Conor tko didn't make it?
17408	233	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Honestly one of my favorite parts of Jiri’s fight is how much he went up the middle to the body. So many people just head hunt, but those teeps were huge
17409	234	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	That Jiri fight was like a tornado, so much chaos and of course with that violant ending became perfect.
17410	235	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	THIS is the content you need to be putting out. UFC needs to learn if you dont put it out. Someone else will.
17411	236	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Sandhagen Edgar was this year? Damn does time fly by quick, that felt like it was end of last year. Also, I'm surprised Oliveira and Chandler wasn't in here.
17412	237	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The amount of liquid that comes from Masvidal’s head when he’s hit is impressive
17413	238	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Watching Masvidal getting knocked out. I can hear Morgan Freeman: And just like that it was over.
17414	239	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Dustin vs Conor 2 must be here but yall know son of Dana is red line
17415	240	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jiri has the KO of the year so far, Sandhagen is a close second
17416	241	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usman KO that piece of trash was the most satisfying KO of all time
17417	242	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal may have the fastest knock out in UFC history but he got punched into the 5th dimension by Usman.
17418	243	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Can’t show that boy Conor getting slept and I knew y’all were gonna forget the black beast
17419	244	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The more I see Sandhagen's KO the more badass it looks to me. Perfectly timed perfectly walked off
17420	245	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The usman one was unfair he grabbed his arm then straight lol
17421	246	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	El ko a Masvidal me dejó helado cuando lo vi en vivo. Me dieron escalofríos y hasta me latía rápido el corazón. Ni me la podía creer 😆
17422	247	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Really didn't think they'd include Shane sleep walkin..
17423	248	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Ummmm, what about Dustin vs Connor?
17424	249	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	If Miocics counterpunch landed on the chin correctly he might have had chance...
17425	250	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	These foos really didn’t put dp finishing Conor cause that’s there baby 😂😂😂😂
17426	251	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	They forgot Dustin Poirier's finishes over Mcgregor 💯💎
17427	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	"""The hammerfists were entirely necessary. My job is to hit the guy until the ref pulls me off."" - Jorge Masvidal"
17428	253	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Where is Dustin's one come on UFC he's done something no one done before knocking Conor out!!!
17429	254	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Where is Oliveira/Chandler?
17430	255	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	McGregor?
17431	256	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Too bad we gotta wait until next year to get another HW title fight
17432	257	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Miocic getting ko'd one of my favorites can't lie Francis is a beast
17433	258	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Barboza should be called the red viper. He dropped homeboy like the mountain vs oberyns poison spear in GOT.
17434	259	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	How is the Barboza KO on this list? That was more weird and creepy than “exciting”
17435	260	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Win or lose Reyes is a freaking warrior despite my first thoughts about him. Even getting tagged he fired back heavy in the Jan and jiri fight. Hope he comes back strong next fight after some good time off. Also the Usman finish has to be my favorite
17436	261	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Incredible class of talent, If they’re lucky, at the end of there ufc career they will get the chance to box YouTubers for the biggest payday of there life’s!
17437	262	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	How come Dustin Poirier’s finish against Conor isn’t included in dis vid?
17438	263	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Adrian Yanez vs Gustavo Lopez? That was an amazingly great finish by Adrian.
17439	264	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I think Usman sleeping Jorge was more satisfying than Jorge sleeping Ben
17440	265	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Where is Derrick Lewis’s KO on Curtis Blaydes? Man was stiff as a board
17441	266	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Lol NOT THE CLIP OF DUSTIN FINISHING CONOR ? This is #1 bullshit
17442	267	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Francis' punching precision, hand speed and tightening up was terrifying in Stipe II. Nobody on earth can beat that version of Ngannou hand to hand...except Steven Segal maybe.
17443	268	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Rose landed one of the most effortless question mark hybrid kicks i've ever seen...it just flowed
17444	269	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	*Frankie moves everything at the same time* Frankie: *Stops moving*
17445	270	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	That headkick from Rose was just sexy
17446	271	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Seeing Stipe get knocked out hurts my stomach
17447	272	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Real Opinion: Every single one of ya'll agreed that Conor Mcgregor made our day greater:
17448	273	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	"""I'm gonna bring y'all violence""- Jorge Masvidal."
17449	274	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I definitely feel like Oliveria’s finish over chandler was better than the Barboza finish but you know I don’t make these decisions -_-
17450	275	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Great video👍, even though I thought they would include the Giga Chikadze liver kick
17451	276	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	4:40 man was fighting with 1000 ping😂
17452	277	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	To not show Oliveira’s KO of Michael Chandler is criminal here.
17453	278	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Rose shuts up Rogan almost immediately when she wins a belt Joe: she’s getting a little reckless… Rose: knocks out Joanna Joe: Weili comes forward and smashes… Rose: knocks out Jhang
17454	279	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	The more times I look at usman KOing masvidal, the more perfect it gets lol, I did want masvidal to win but that KO was perfect 🤷🏽‍♂️👍🏽
17455	280	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Weird they didn't include Poirier finishing Conor in January. Also missed out Lewis koing Blaydes.
17456	281	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	How they gonna do my boy gamebred like that with the thumbnail and first clip
17457	282	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	So Poirier knocking out McGregor does not count?
17458	283	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I don't think street jesus will ever be the same after that ko
17459	284	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Herb Dean always seems like he's outta position, he starts running back and forth and has no idea what to do
17460	285	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	lol @ Dustin KOing Conor not being on this list, UFC playing massive favorite
17461	286	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Didn’t Dustin KO Conor in this year
17462	287	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Usmans finish is my favorite, something about Masvidal’s limp body being pushed away after the punch is crazy
17463	288	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jiri had the best one so far IMO
17464	289	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Ain't no huge fan of Usman or probably even at all really since he cheated to start his reign but that was probably one of the cleanest right hands you gon see anywhere. The follow through. I don't think I ever seen any right hand go clean past the head like that when hitting it. Edit: I thought I remembered it going further past his head than that. Still went straight through tho.
17465	290	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	This video is gonna do some BIG NUMBERS, what a year so far!! 🔥🔥
17466	291	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Man I was at the arena when Usman landed that shot. The crowd was silenced ever so momentarily before realizing the greatness and cheering.
17467	292	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Still hurts to watch Masvidal get ko’d like that ngl
17468	293	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Stipe has power. Half unconcious and moving backwards he stumbled Francis. Before getting KTFO.
17469	294	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal getting knocked out by a similar punch that he was showing Jake Paul is sweet justice
17470	295	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Sandhagen vs Yan is going to be epic if it ever happens.
17471	296	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	how was Sean O'Malley's death punch not on here dude was executed in the middle of the ring
17472	297	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I can see that Edson added poision damage to his punches
17473	298	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Yeah just when everyone thought Francis could not get any scarier - he got scarier.
17474	299	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jorge’s knock out was totally necessary. Edit: Super necessary. 😂 😂
17475	300	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Kamaru treated Jorge like Jorge treated Askren.
17476	301	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	"Masvidal to judge: ""You know I'm getting up"""
17477	302	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Barboza knocking out shane burgos was insane
17478	303	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Look how they massacred my boy- Stipe fans including me
17479	304	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jiri Prochazka knockout on Reyes got to be here, dame that was something else
17480	305	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	man watching the stipe fight still hurts, hope he can get that one back and retire as the greatest heavyweight
17481	306	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I really like the Jiri one, something about putting Dom flat on hi face with a spinning elbow is so cool
17482	307	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Sandhagens knee was the smoothest thing I have ever seen
17483	308	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Frankie likes to move around a lot. His head sure move back pretty fast. When he caught that flying knee😵lol.
17484	309	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I guess the Diamond and Black Beast are both jokes to UFC.
17485	310	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Ben Askren is definitely smiling rn
17486	311	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Thank god they ain’t do my boy Blaydes like that 🙏
17487	312	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	If only Dom realized how bad he hurt Jiri with that upkick
17488	313	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I know it was a massive KO, but man I don't think it can be overstated how impressive it was for Kamaru to outstrike Masvidal, even more so to knock him completely unconscious. What a champ.
17489	314	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Kamaru Usman should've won the BMF belt along with the WW belt.
17490	315	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Man I sure liked seeing fake Scarface. Get his mouth shut Jordan.
17491	316	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	How is Lewis vs Blaydes not on here? That was one of the most beautifully timed uppercuts in recent memory.
17492	317	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I looked at Usman's record on Wikipedia I think and it said KO(punch) when it was clearly multiple punches that put Masvidal out.
17493	318	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	2:55 the best
17494	319	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	khabib is the best ever ♥️
17495	320	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	At this point I don’t see anyone beating Ngannou at heavyweight
17496	321	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Kamaru Usman’s Knockout against masvidal really won me over has a kamaru fan
17497	322	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Wow. Not surprised Dustin isn’t on here. Ufc knows Conor is done💀
17498	323	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Conor in round 1.
17499	324	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	I will have the best finish in ufc history wair few years
17500	325	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Masvidal was getting up but usman gave him some super necessary hammer fists
17501	326	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Gotta be the Kumaru knock out of Masvidal!!!
17502	327	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d0NNKTkk3E	Jorge got baptised lol

17857	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Who won the match ?
17858	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	watson to wahab :- Boss meine apko bola kia ?
17859	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I think after match there was a fight between starc and watson 😂
17860	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Wahab vs Australia tha ye match, Is match me agar Pakistan ke baki players ne fielding me bs Wahab ka sath de diya hota to pak ye match jeet jati. Bht fisaddi fielding ki thi Pakistan ne.
17861	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I still remember Pakistan dropped Watson 3 or 4 times I think.
17862	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Vo toh Watson mar nhi rha tha ...nhi toh Wahab ka last match hota yeh
17863	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	For a strange reason I support Riaz here..
17864	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Watson in kohli style - chal ball dal teri mkc 😂
17865	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Watson se nazre milane me kyu fatt rhi thi
17866	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Wahab Riaz such cocky attitude. But aus won that world cup Go home with that low class attitude
17867	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I remember, I was going out to buy something and this match was on. Believe me, this match was seen on Indian streets like it was India who was playing. People were cheering for Pakistan and were in complete awe with Wahab's spell.
17868	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	A lot of barking and no biting. Watson showed his class. Could’ve taken him on and ripped him apart but clearly the team winning was the ultimate goal and not some personal rivalry
17869	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	No Doubt wahab was excellent but beauty is also how calm watson is... & that's where australia won the match
17870	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	this is not game of sprit bowiling achi hai but aisa nhi hai ki aap saamne vale ko kuch na smjho
17871	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Everyone Is appreciating wahab for his spell but no one Salutes the patience of Shane Watson in this match.. He played a match winning innings that day ❤
17872	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	We Indians appreciate his bowling. We will just respect the talented. Whether he was from Pakistan. Personally there is no rival between Indian and pakistani people. Our leaders just want that separation or rivalry. We respect you brothers and sisters.
17873	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Us din to Ye Aaj ugal rha h...maine pura match dekha tha😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
17874	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	In this Match i support pakistan because if the semi final held between india and pakistan then absolutely india will beat pakistan and reached into the final 🤩😍
17875	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	one of the most OVERRATED spells in cricket history....Thats coming from a Pakistani...
17876	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Bowler like..Muhhamad amir..Wasim Akram..shoaib aktar...Mohammad Asif...wahab..Hasan Ali....Pakistan produced best fast bowler's...n swing also...love from india
17877	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Ngl but i watched this match live on star sports, i was cheering for riaz. This is the best spell by any bowler, stark triggered riaz while he was batting in first inning and result would be different if rahat hadn't dropped that catch.
17878	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Greatest world cup ever.
17879	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Can't forget this spell never ever. That was the first and last time when I want to see victory of Pakistan. greatest spell that I have seen. If fielder support Wahab on that day the history would be different.
17880	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	bad ma jo cham tara watsan inka 😂😂😂😂
17881	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Abey saale Wahab🖕🏼🖕🏼 Watson tera baap hai💪💪 Tuna pehle seam or swing karna seekhle😂😂😂 bada aaya throw bowling karne🤣
17882	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Never miss with Watson👊🏼🤨👊🏼
17883	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Many talking about Wahab Riaz being fired up ...but can we appreciate how cool and calm Shane Watson was no matter what Wahab Riaz was saying to him and stayed unbeaten at 64 in the end... 😅😅
17884	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Aise ball Rohit Sharma ko daale hote toh samaj rahe hoo naa 200+ runs
17885	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	THAT TIME WHEN grounds were full of crowd
17886	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Who won the match ?
17887	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Watson alone faced him like a man, he took him with his attitude without saying any words. Best❤️
17888	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Watson ke hatte chad gaye to kya hoga ye janto ho
17889	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I remember watching this match. That fiery spell from Wahab Riaz. Had that catch been taken Australia would not have won that match. But such easy catches need to be taken
17890	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	This was undoubtedly one of the best World Cup spells of modern day cricket! If only Pakistan fielded well in this game, they would’ve beaten Australia, and we would’ve had an India vs Pakistan semi-final! Insane
17891	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Indians friends are also appreciating Wahab Riaz for his magnificent spell, really feeling proud to see this Thank you Dear neighbors ❤️❤️
17892	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Best bowling spell of the cricket.. I have ever seen 😍🔥
17893	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Isiliye sale piche hai ajj tak
17894	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Wahab riaz much better bowler than all the bowlers in India combined. He has height He has pace He has swing He has the looks He is aggressive. All in 1 package!
17895	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Riaz gave his everything in that spell. Fight for the pride.
17896	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Pak won the world cup, t20 world cup,icc championship against ind😂😂😂. Then some people will say pak is worst team
17897	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	shorturl.ca/kisscamjtlft Essendo solo una parte del quadro generale, replicato da fonti straniere, la ricerca moderna e dedicata all'anatema socialdemocratico. Il punto di vista opposto implica che i partecipanti diretti al progresso tecnologico ci chiamino a nuove conquiste, di cui, a loro volta, bisogna rendere conto. Il punto di vista opposto implica che cercando di soppiantare la produzione tradizionale, la nanotecnologia non e altro che la quintessenza della vittoria del marketing sulla ragione e dovrebbe essere distribuita in modo associativo tra i settori. E difficile dire perche le azioni dei rappresentanti dell'opposizione siano distribuite in modo associativo nei settori.. Para o mundo moderno, a coesao de uma equipe de profissionais desempenha um papel decisivo em um sistema de formacao de pessoal que atenda as necessidades urgentes. No entanto, nao se deve esquecer que o inicio do trabalho cotidiano de formacao de cargos, em sua visao classica, permite a introducao de um repensar da politica economica externa.As tecnologias modernas atingiram tal nivel que, diluido com uma boa dose de empatia, o pensamento racional cria as pre-condicoes para repensar as politicas economicas externas. Como se costuma acreditar, algumas caracteristicas da politica interna nada mais sao do que a quintessencia da vitoria do marketing sobre a razao e devem ser descritas com o maximo de detalhes possivel.
17898	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	This is just one over. ICC has to upload all the deliveries from this insane spell!
17899	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Why australian players always get fucked up.
17900	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I m Indian and obviously Indian cricket 🏏 fan.. but i m huge wahab fan too especially after this game .. I literally had tears for him after they lost the game .. Aus never deserved the World Cup ..
17901	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	No one's gonna talk about how comfortable Steve Smith was during this fiery spell. Watched the game live, he didn't even flinch while Watson was dancing his way around. Gun player!!
17902	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I am from India but am very happy to see this. Because Asian bowler ne dra diya in Australians ko proud moment for asian teams
17903	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Man that was some Great bowling from wahab. And that clapping 😂🔥. Australia getting the treatment of their own medicine.

17905	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Talent knows no boundaries but appreciation Happy to see Indians praising Riyaz spell.. ❤️ True gentlemen spirit
17906	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	For the first time I was cheering for Pakistan that was an unforgettable spell respect for Riaz from India 🇮🇳
17907	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Thank-you ICC you informed me Pace is pace, I thought Pace was spin.

17910	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	AUSTRALIA 🇦🇺 won by 7 Wickets with 103 balls to spare🤣🤣🤣.
17911	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I watched this match. It was one of the best spells... Watson was scared to touch...
17912	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	*shahzad enter the room* Selectors : What are your strengths ? Shahzad : I look like poor man's Virat *Gets selected*
17913	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I can tell you this, almost all of the Indian fans were in awe and cheering on Wahab that day. I'm a huge fan of his bowling now.
17914	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I’m Australian and still remember this as one of the best spells of aggressive pace I’ve seen. Watson looked scared out there and should’ve been caught in the deep. Would love to see the whole spell.
17915	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Shane Watson always has a confused look on his face😂😂
17916	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Probably the only spell in cricket history appreciated by all cricket lovers even indians 😂😂

17921	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Nobody Literally nobody Wahab riaz just saying come on in his sledging 😂😂😂😂
17922	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Imagine the kind of pressure bowler made with such bowling and then fielder drops catch... Such a heartbreak 😞
17923	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Wahab Riaz ki maa ka bhosda
17924	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Kya Itna Bura Hun Mein MAA 😢😢😢 ( Why only me everytime ) : Shane Watson
17925	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	2:55 watson be like... yar meri kia ghalti hai mujhpy kiun garam horaha hai. 😂😂
17926	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Pure class man. Wahab shut off Watson like a pro 😂
17927	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	undoubtedly one of the best pace bowling spells of the decade. reminded me of the great Wasim Paaji in 1992 WC. Respect to the pace bowling battery of 🇵🇰 from 🇮🇳
17928	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	He fires on watson and claps on him what a beauty. Life time insUlt for watson
17929	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Never ever mess with watson
17930	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Shahzad acting like the ball missed the stumps by inches in that throw 😂😂😂
17931	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	One of the most fiery spells that I have ever seen Wahab literally exposed Watson. Watson shouldn't have messed with him. I watched it live and that spell made me so excited. Respect from India to this talented pacer.
17932	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I watched live on TV still remember all deliveries. I felt very bad when Wahab was crying after loss. Never seen a spell like this in my whole life. Watson even could not touch with the bat. It seems that Wahab and keeper were playing no batsman on the crease.
17933	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I was in delhi while watching it live , one of the most fire 🔥 like pace i have seen after akram , Bret Lee and waquar . What a spell
17934	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	it was the patience of watson that he kept standing there and took his team to victory
17935	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Not only Australia ,Pakistan also sledge.
17936	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Jitna shandaar Pakistan ka bowling attack hai utna hi fisadii fielding department hai.. this was one of the greatest spell 👌👌
17937	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Waston: Australian are number one clezer.....W.Riaz: Hold My Damn Hand. We are always support Pakistan from BD💖💖
17938	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	This is the real talent of fast bowling m from india but first time I have seen Aussies in back foot Wahab Riaz u will be remembered for this fairiciois spell
17939	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I remember reading a beautiful article written by Andrew Fernando (Sri Lanka) on this spell by Wahhab to Watson on Crickinfo.
17940	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I can imagine short pitched bowling VS Hitman 🔥
17941	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I was there in Adelaide , when these bruises were on from Wahab..what a day! I never saw Australian batting being treated like this before.
17942	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Beauty of watson, always smiling
17943	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	This was an era of Pakistan when 220, 230 was not difficult to defend...❤
17944	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I ve never seen Watson getting this much humiliated
17945	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Australia it's a small target we will get it comfortably : Wahab Riaz : Hold my bear ⚡
17946	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	lmao they dont even care about wahab, aussies won easily
17947	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	"I still remember Michael Holding saying, ""If you want to see what real pace bowling should be like then go and watch wahab's world cup spell to Australia.""...had the potential to become the Wasim Akram of modern era but another talent wasted."
17948	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Wicket mili nahi ki haggna💩 shuru
17949	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	"5 years from then and pakistan still hasn't improved their fielding yet. That's why they say ""Catches wins matches"". You have to complement your bowlers. Only if Maxwell's & Watson's catch would have been taken😔"
17950	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	For me it was the best spell of the decade 🔥 Watson was literally scared while facing him throughout his innings. Unbelievable!! Wahab, big fan from India ❤🇮🇳
17951	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	⚠️ Pakistan(the land of pacers) But my most favorite is Wasim Akram(the great)
17952	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Honestly saying this is one of the best spells ever in history of cricket. This is the only pak player who impressed most of the cricket fans that night. Truly amazing 👏👏 --- From 🇮🇳
17953	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Yorkers, bouncers, speed, line and length. He has everything what a perfect fast bowler needs.
17954	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	After this 3 player decided to retire-clark, watson, rahat ali😂
17955	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Kiruba kiruba fans attenance here 🌍🌍🙋🙋‍♂️🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊
17956	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	He is a really talented aggresive baller.Hope to see him In LPL🇱🇰❤️
17957	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Love u ❣️ WAHAB u beauty
17958	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	It seems Watson will cry if it continues . But the Aussies generally begin this .
17959	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	1:02 who thought that this much energy will convert in to yawns after 4 years😂😂
17960	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Watson be like : main madar **** hon jo ismain aya 😂😂
17961	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I am not a fan of pakistan I am a fan of Shane watson But on that day I really wanted pakistan to win the match. Wahab Riaz was on another planet on that day, he wasn't sledging Aussies actually he was hunting and haunting them 🔥
17962	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Seen this a lot of times batsman dominating the game, but it's quite rare to see a bowler do it.
17963	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	During Wahab's Batting, Watson to Wahab: Do you forget to bring the bat? You can't even touch the ball! During Watson's batting, Wahab to Watson: Do you know how to bat?
17964	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Australian think that only they can sledge in cricket... When any asian player starts sledging they act like the most decent players & so as their audience too..
17965	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	If the catch of Watson wasn't dropped then Pakistan would have definitely won the match
17966	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	where is the rest of the video ??? Those next two overs were memorable to watson and the missed opportunity ???
17967	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Petition to ICC, Please upload his whole spell Thank you🙏🏻
17968	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	what was the end result mattered most...Watson survive that spell and stear his team through...
17969	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	This was not justice to Wahab Riaz.. Poor fielding cost them the match.. They should have won it..
17970	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	they only Intelligent and skillful bowler Pakistan ever produced after wasim,wakar, shoaib era.
17971	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Wow.. I do rarely comment on videos.. but boy, that spell.. should easily be one of the greatest spells that I had watched.. N most of you would agree
17972	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I've never seen more intimidating spell of fast bowling then this one in my whole life.. one of the best of best
17973	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Haha Australian Crowds booing Wahab for giving it back to their side. This was an intense spell and a perfect reply from Riaz towards their arrogance. Straight 🔥
17974	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	That agression 🔥🔥🔥.... Whenever we watch this spell we appreciate Wahab but we very soon get angry on Rahat Ali for putting that catch of Watson who was absolutely clueless of Wahab's spell.
17975	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I like the way Wato smiled at wahab it was like don't over do you are already loosing the match 😂😂😂😂
17976	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	This might be the best bowling spell of the last decade by a fast bowler in an odi. Classic Pakistani fielding again let down the bowlers.
17977	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Did you check my chennal? subscribe then edited: ooh thnx you guyz liked it
17978	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	I loved his spell to Watson, he has no clue how to play Wahab, almost lost his wicket. I watched this spell several times. If the drop catch wouldn’t happened, the match result would had been different.
17979	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2epS5x0aA	Back then when Ahmed Sheazad actually used to bat well

18022	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	When they pick models who is lifeless and boneless. Me:ummm 🤔 they're taste of uniqueness is over the top cant relate to that.
18023	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Love the dresses, but why does it say Yasmin Le Bon? Maybe she is her daughter, Amber?
18024	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	These ladies all look like Bond villainesses, and the lady in the red dress is their leader. I kinda love it
18025	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Is it just me or is anyone else confused by these outfits..... expensive things make no sense to me 🤷🏾‍♀️
18026	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Am I the only one who's gonna point out the girl at 1:16 looks like she's has a cellphone taped to her belly as a belt 😂
18027	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	The red dress would have been cool if she could actually walk in it. Whats the point of making it so heavy?
18028	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	I love how they make all the girls look the same.
18029	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	The girl at 0:36 walking into her ex wedding n 4:02.her ex funeral I love her walk I wished she opened the show.

18033	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Runway models are intended to look the same w/ makeup so spectators would focus on the clothes not the faces lol
18034	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	That’s just stupid. She can hardly walk and it’s ugly. What a waste!
18035	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	The fabric! So beautiful, the flow, hang and cut of it was masterful. The dress at the end however was clunky and needed editing of at least 50lbs of ornamentation.
18036	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	LOL....Guuuurrrrrl.....you doin' the floss dance on the runway? Wha?? 2:20

18038	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	1:13 is that a *phone* im i the only one seeing this
18039	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Y'all seem to be forgetting how makeup works and that most designers want models who look the same so people focus on the clothes more.
18040	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	I think they should start smiling..change it up a bit. They look scary lol... If they Smile the environment may be in a better mood it will be a friendly autmophere 😁
18041	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	I have never seen a runway with so much good catwalks, 1st and 3rd one have amazing catwalks
18042	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Why are they all so thin ???
18043	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	All the models look the same.
18044	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	all faces are same for me😲😲
18045	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Solo. Los. Sapatos megustan. Los vestidos no

18050	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	0:57 looks like mushrooms growing on a tree
18051	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Do All the models look strangely similar 😅 or is it just me
18052	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	The dresses are ALL amazing but it would have been 10 times better if they let the models embrace a personnality when they were walking like in the marco marco shows 4 exemple. Here the models are looking good but are just not living a fantasy
18053	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	The girl at 0:40 was fierce asf😍😍
18054	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	This is pretty wearable collection wow... That model with the red dress didn't make it for me... The wow effect was gone
18055	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	**disclaimer** no melanin was used in the making of this production

18059	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Come on girl!!!!!!!! 2:27 was bomb
18060	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	whats the point of that heavy gown? who the hell is gonna be able to wear it in public and walk around? its too heavy but very beautiful
18061	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	whats the song called?
18062	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	That awkward moment when the dress is heavier than all the skinny model.
18063	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Pretty dresses, but what's the point of wearing that red one if you can't walk in it.. -_-
18064	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Compare this to Versace 😂
18065	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	The dress at 3:00 and 3:56 are KILLERS
18066	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	The red and white dress.
18067	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	I hate it when the models flaps their dresses about...it looks so stupid and unimaginative.
18068	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Mrs. Le Bon looks incredible. It's hard to believe she's 47 years old in this runway.
18069	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	such very great fashion but what's that Music????- it isnot possible to watch the total Show because of that stupid Music :-(
18070	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	fashion,chic,é muito elegante...
18071	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Why the camera skip the Asian model?
18072	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	I love everything about this collection, makeup, hair, clothing. Put together very well. The models looked so confident.
18073	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Fashion, elegant, unique, let the wearer more confidence
18074	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	Superb need to see this designer
18075	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	good work but a little unrealistic
18076	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	How nobody fell over is beyond me, bless the one at the end.
18077	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	hmmmmm. made a big splash, kudos for that... but these gowns are not really doing anything new or exciting. the mirrors had finger prints on them for crying out loud.
18078	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhUnZtZbIpk	LOVE this collection, beautiful, ethereal dresses. What a pity the designer didn't see fit to use some women of colour to model the clothes, this is an extremely unfortunate and worrying trend on the runway these days...

The best thing to do with your money is to invest it rightly, because money left for saving always end up used with no returns. I started investing in bitcoin mid November 2020 with the help of a well-known -professional Mr Burton Schilichter and the profit entirely funded my recent duplex.

18195	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPc2ta76a_E	Honestly, this is a foreshadow of Kim Jones becoming Versace’s creative designer in the future. I saw Gianni Versace in him ❤️

18306	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	You need a great set of cricketing minds to actually win from these scenarios which someone like Ponting, Dhoni and Waugh had. The current Indian team is bound to fail in major ICC knockout games like the Bangladesh, because most of the Indian cricketers dont even possess that level of calm & the ability to absorb pressure. Pant, Iyer, Suryakumar, Pandya, Thakur, Chahar they all fall into the same category, even these guys would try to be the flamboyant star and try hitting the ball for a six or a boundary.
18307	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	With love from Dhoni to Mushfiqur Rahim. Idiot was showing a lot of attitude.🤣🤣🤣🤣

18340	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	The toxicity of this comment section oh my gawd! Why don't you try to be kind toward each other? It was a game. We were heartbroken and you guys celebrated it.this is it. That's how should be a game right? As a Bangladeshi we respect Dhoni a lot.world won't find another Dhoni. He's a living legend <3
18341	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	As Bangladeshi, when the match happened, we felt so bad, especially for our crickets but now we don't have any feelings for our crickets, they have no improvement. They just play with over emotion to win, no practice much, no strategy. The government gave them too many facilities and unlimited support from people made them arrogant.
18342	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	this match is biggining of fixing between Bangladesh & India.

18349	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	I miss him so much,how as a captain he defended the lowest targets. That player played for his country not for the ICC rankings or any records. That's the difference between Virat Kohli and Dhoni.
18350	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	Dhoni > Kohli.

He strengthen the Indian Fielding !!!

18387	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	Any other keeper in the world would have gone for a throw, Dhoni backing himself went for a sprint. That just goes to show how smart and collective he was, not just as a captain but as a wicketkeeper as well. Best Indian Captain Ever!!!
18388	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	My father cheered out loud after this. a precious moment it was
18389	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	That day Bangladesh needed 2 runs from 3 balls !!! First two balls two catches and two wickets !!!! Last ball was left !! Bangladesh still couldn't score that 2 runs in 3 balls but lost 3 wickets in that 3 balls !!! Two catches and 1 run out !!! This is called mind games !!! India had played mind games that day !! And poor Bangladesh became a victim !!! 😁

18396	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	1 run needed on 3 balls to draw the match. It was impossible for india to win and look at mahi’s expressions after running him out as if nothing happened. It was no less than a miracle.
18397	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	I still wonder 🤔 why this ball wasn't a wide!

18516	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	One of the best nights of my life .I remember my dad ,my mom and my sister switching off the TV when Rahim scored a boundary and celebrated. Then just as we all were going to the beds , the guy who lived in the floor above just screamed 'YES' , we knew it was a wicket but still didn't have the courage to switch on the TV. But then after a minute , when we heard him shouting even louder the second time, we all started screaming also because we knew it was 2 wickets in 2 balls and rushed to switch on the TV and what followed was one of the best moments of my life. We 4 were literally jumping, dancing and throwing stuff in excitement. Thank you indian team for this!

Dhoni did not throw. He ran up to break the stumps. How fast is the cutter man? Mustafizur is out! India win! India keep their campaign alive and look at those celebrations. Kohli exults wildly. Pandya is out of breath. He is hunched over his knees after defending only 10 runs! It was a short ball outside off, wide outside off, Shuvagata can't reach it. and Bangladesh have fallen agonisingly short Mustafizur Rahman run out (†Dhoni) 0 (2m 0b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0 Nehra, Dhoni, Kohli and Yuvi together but its Nehra doing all the talking. Shuvagata on strike. Third man back. Dhoni has pulled off his right glove to throw in case of a bye . Mid-off is up, cover is up. Pomil Proch: ""Fitting enough to say that the script of this match is way way better than Batman Vs Superman "" W Pandya to Mahmudullah, OUT And its Jaddu again! The man who was moved from cover, their best fielder was positioned there by Dhoni and he comes into the play immediately because Mahmudullah went for a slog off a full toss! Jadeja ran in, then to his right and took the catch reverse cup! Pressure catch. And now its two off one Mahmudullah c Jadeja b Pandya 18 (48m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 81.82 Pandya, Nehra and Dhoni looking for plan Z as Shuvagata Hom walks out. But he won't be on strike. Mahmudullah will be because the batsmen crossed. Two runs off two balls... Third man and point are up. Dhawan moves to deep cover, Jaddu now moves to deep midwicket 19.4 W Pandya to Mushfiqur, OUT He's caught at deep midwicket, did they cross, with Mahmudullah be on strike? The slower ball, the short ball, the pull shot and without the pace it comes straight down Dhawan's throat Mushfiqur Rahim c Dhawan b Pandya 11 (15m 6b 2x4 0x6) SR: 183.33 19.3 4 Pandya to Mushfiqur, FOUR runs Fist pumps, bat swinging, yells! Mushy wanders outside off and scoops it away. Past Dhoni. It was not timed properly. Just one of those shots that just had enough bat to fit in the gap. But fine leg was up and the plan was sound Now Nehra comes up to talk to Pandya... Then Nehra and Dhoni have a chat... India are well behind the over-rate jeanluc: ""Honestly, this is first nail biter last over match of the tournament."" 19.2 4 Pandya to Mushfiqur, FOUR runs Slower ball goes wrong - it is short of a length and wide outside off - Mushy smacks it through extra cover! That's a top shot, and he went so deep in the crease! 10 from five now, and Dhoni is up to his bowler to give him some advice. Long conversation this. Kohli trying to get someone's attention... Deep square leg comes up, fine leg comes up.... 19.1 1 Pandya to Mahmudullah, 1 run Goes full and wide, steered to deep cover Nehra, Rohit, Dhoni and Pandya having a mini-meeting. Pats on the back for the man with the responsibility to defend only 10 runs. Mahmudullah on strike. Third man and point are up. Fine leg is up and very fine. Sweeper cover is back (Jaddu being put there instead of Dhawan)"

18590	291	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	Bangladesh could have won this match easily by taking singles, but they tried to win it in style.

18626	327	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	2 points to notice: 1. MSD's fitness: the non striker is almost half the way on the pitch when MSD decides to run and he still beats him by almost a foot. 2. Presence of mind : MSD doesn't throw the ball as soon as he collects it coz, striker was still in the crease and it would have meant not out. After ricocheting from stumps, they would have got a single easily. Instead he chooses to run and take the bails off to make it a dead ball.

18632	333	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	In this match & in this situation Dhoni👑 completed 2meters in just 13 seconds😎😎 and it is world record🏏🏏
18633	334	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	Ban players: How could u do that!!!! Thala: I can do this all day😎
18634	335	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	Ms.Dhoni : finisher , best captain ,best keeper and he is legeng one like for dhoni
18635	336	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	Title is wrong Right is Dhoni makes indians heart 💓❤️❤️❤️

18637	338	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	Actually, Pandya bowled Wide Ball, but no one noticed🔥🔥😂
18638	339	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	The confidence of MSD to outrun the batsman. At this point even Usain Bolt's confidence was probably shattered.
18639	340	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	""""" Koi puche to bol dena ek tha jo stump ke piche se bhi match palat deta tha...""""😍😍😍😍"

18643	344	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	"We fans of MSD would say this as the last words to MSD "" Thank you MSD for everything you gave us "" Anyways love to team India from Australia"
18644	345	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	While stumping, Dhoni was looking at the batsman instead of the stumps. The level of confidence this guy has on each and every move he is going to commit is humungous!!! Even being completely aware that if he failed to finish that run to the stumps, the whole country would be angry at him, he went for it..... the decision was never depending on the luck, but only on his solid confidence. He knows to finish the game while batting as well as otherwise.
18645	346	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	Dhoni had to run more distance to make the batsman run out . The sprinting speed of Dhoni is in M/S.
18646	347	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	MS Dhoni was broke aloso my heart in this day but stil i have love for MS Dhoni from bangladesh

18685	386	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUuSm7gHHk	I had gone to watch this match in the stadium. When it was 2 runs required of 3 balls, we along with few people started to leave the stadium thinking that we lost this game. Fortunately there was a gaint screen in the passage where match was being telecasted and there was a 30 second lag. When we came near gaint screen we heard a big roar from the crowd in the stands. People stopped moving and place near gaint screen was blocked. We came to know about the wicket after looking at the gaint screen and there was mini roar in the passage. Now it is 2 runs of 2 balls. We here one more big roar from the stands and we wait anxiously to find out another wicket has fallen. There was another mini roar in the stands. Then after few seconds we here another big roar from the stands and this confirmed in our hearts that india has won. After historical moment is being telecasted in big screen, the crowd in the passage went mental. I remembering seeing few diehard fans doing full shastanga namaskar to MSD'S poster in the passage. I will never forget this experience.

18708	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltTpu60Q6XE	The comments on this are so toxic, you realize that there are entire nude cultures right, there’s nothing wrong with appreciating radical design on the female body, plus, no one forced this event to happen, it happen in the light of interest, form, wealth and freedom. Just because you are offended by nudity or indecency doesn’t mean you should take away from other peoples pleasures in life. Many people enjoy multiple positions available at these events, from modeling to filming, attending as a viewer/ investor. Chill out on the “the world is ending” nonsense, there are a lot worse things going on in your parents bedrooms than what’s happening here, this is a showing of professionals at their best, with the best tools available to them as well. Go be sower and resentful elsewhere, this is for enjoying.
18709	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltTpu60Q6XE	У меня вопрос, а как справлять нужду в таком « одеянии»? Отклеил и заклеил? Или это уже несъемный элемент кожи? НУЖНО БОЛЬШЕ ИЗОЛЕНТЫ!

Девахи голые скоро ноги раздвинут и в камеру секель свой совать будут. Загадки в женщинах нет больше... смотрите, мужики, что хотите, нате вам. И промежность и булки силиконовые с сиськами.

18725	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltTpu60Q6XE	Really beautiful women and outfits. The tape is used to put each models body in scene perfectly. It's not about wearing this in real life. It's about body art. I think they all look stunning and it's an interesting way of covering the body. Never thought about satan or porn. Comment section in real trouble.

19070	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	I had a hard time watching them walk. No offense
19071	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	Me quedo con kendall,gigi y adriana lima osea con las de victoria secret aunque tan bien me gusta la idea de que no solo las flacas y altas puedan ser modelos
19072	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	Honestly everyone can do and wear whatever they want and the models are all beautiful, but this is a little too much and disgusting, you can literally see everything, the private zones etc. Who is going to be this comfortable wearing one of these at the beach for example?
19073	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	You'd like a line of everyone and a body♥
19074	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	Frankly speaking its not nice too see...were is the dignity for how many centurys of keeping those part of girls privacy... lucky to show the private parts for what purpose...?
19075	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	Two things I can relate to, tan lines and camel toe
19076	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	Thời trang đẹp ghê. 😘😘
19077	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	These are the ugliest outfits I've ever seen. They barely cover the model's private parts. Eventually they'll be having runway models just wear genital covering tape. Feeling really dissapointed in humanity rn.
19078	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	The bikini doesn't make the body shape better.
19079	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	Falf of them are looking like borat inspiration 😊 like even the bra is not fitting correctly
19080	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	I am not a fan of that 80s high cut swimwear/lingerie look. It looks dated!
19081	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A04yr-mqAE0	Those models are lazy women coz they don’t like to work hard for earning money Sorry English is not my language

Y aconteció que murió el mendigo, y fué llevado por los ángeles al seno de Abraham: y murió también el rico, y fué sepultado Y en el infierno alzó sus ojos, estando en los tormentos, y vió á Abraham de lejos, y á Lázaro en su seno. Entonces él, dando voces, dijo: Padre Abraham, ten misericordia de mí, y envía á Lázaro que moje la punta de su dedo en agua, y refresque mi lengua; porque soy atormentado en esta llama Y díjole Abraham: Hijo, acuérdate que recibiste tus bienes en tu vida, y Lázaro también males; mas ahora éste es consolado aquí, y tú atormentado Y además de todo esto, una grande sima está constituída entre nosotros y vosotros, que los que quisieren pasar de aquí á vosotros, no pueden, ni de allá pasar acá Y dijo: Ruégote pues, padre, que le envíes á la casa de mi padre; Porque tengo cinco hermanos; para que les testifique, porque no vengan ellos también á este lugar de tormento. Y Abraham le dice: A Moisés y á los profetas tienen: óiganlos. El entonces dijo: No, padre Abraham: mas si alguno fuere á ellos de los muertos, se arrepentirán Mas Abraham le dijo: Si no oyen á Moisés y á los profetas, tampoco se persuadirán, si alguno se levantare de los muertos.

They would literally look cringe on 99.9 percent of women... You don't want to date someone conceded enough to think that wearing this shit to the beach is a good idea.

19374	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKb0p4HZPs	Why do anti-nudity Laws still exist? Clearly it's time to scrap the philosophy that the human body (genitals included) is evil to see and should be hidden from view. I don't believe our obesity problem would not exist if people were made to show their bodies in public.

19379	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKb0p4HZPs	While they are certainly all visually attractive, watching them 'walk' (or whatever the hell they are doing) down the catwalk makes me think we need to get them physiological help. Because none of them are walking like humans... This summer, the short bus goes to the beach...
19380	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKb0p4HZPs	"Why do these fashion show people wish to make these pretty girls look crippled when they do the ""Catwalk""?"
19381	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKb0p4HZPs	"Why do models have this ""deformed"" walk?"

19384	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKb0p4HZPs	It’d be cool if they acknowledged each other and said “hey”, or did a “sup” type chin check to each other when passing by each other...I know it’s part of their rules to not interact with each other on stage to look more professional, but it almost makes you feel like they all hate each other and are jealous of one another, with a purely competitive mindset... But hell, all that aside, I’d love to have all of their hands in marriage🥵😍🤩

19424	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKb0p4HZPs	Feels like I opened Playboy, not a Fashion show... beautiful girls (not models) but I can't concentrate on their outfits because of their horrible catwalk...
19425	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKb0p4HZPs	It’s good to see that the models have some meat on their bones or have athletic figures. I think that the one-piece swimsuits are much more appealing than the bikinis.
19426	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKb0p4HZPs	My legless dog can walk better than these so called models. No.2 and no.4 were good
19427	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMKb0p4HZPs	they don't know how to walk... the pieces are nice tho

Then I changed my mind, I want the job of removing it instead, because every day at work would be just like Xmas. ;) Definitely gotta commend him on his choice of models. Love women with curves, not those anorexic stick figures that you see in a lot of the fashion shows.
19432	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyfc_MLpkRw	Impresionante que trabajo sacrificado para el diseñador!!!!😇

19587	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyfc_MLpkRw	I don't mind this style of arts and crafts because they know what they are selling and they are going for it. They are not selling haute couture. It is interesting in the design sense. Is it fashion...well no, that has to do with the structure and design of fabric in relation to the body. My only concern is...tape...on the vulva...? Like the model in the bronze look at 9:24 who needed to 'adjust' her crotch tape; it would be uncomfortable and potentially damaging to the sensitive genitalia. Glue and the vulva are not friends. Let's remember this.
19588	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyfc_MLpkRw	"Коллекцию нужно было назвать ""Любите ли вы изоленту, так как люблю ее я..."" The collection should have been called “Do you like duct tape as I love it?” how boring...."

19607	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Does the neck trick actually work? Anyone
19608	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	My favourite jeans are mens I'm 61 I don't wear jeans that often but it's only men's that give me the high waist I want and I would never ever buy jeans that are frayed of torn there for the gardening or the bin a freinds daughter gave her nan some jeans to wash for her nan my immediate freinds cut off all the frayed bits and really neatly patched them up pack them up for the granddaughter to take bake to uni
19609	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I bought a pair of Guess jeans for a little over a hundred bucks two years ago. They lasted about three months before the fabric tore in the butt area. The fabric itself was simply worn down to flimsy nothing, just from sitting down in them. I hadn't worn them every day, nor had I washed them more than a few times, and I never put them in the dryer. So my question is: how much should I spend on a pair of jeans to get my money's worth? I feel like I spent just the wrong amount -- as in, I'd not spent enough to go into the truly good quality jeans, but rather skimmed the top of the bad quality category. I've not bought any jeans since, and I don't have any other proper pairs, which sucks. But I just don't have the money to blow on another bad pair that lasts less time than my crappy second-hand jeggings.
19610	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Love it! So helpful. This explains why I always loved jeans from thrift stores cause they were older made better. Had a lot and offered a couple pair to someone in need and she boxed up every pair maybe by mistake and took all of my older made jeans! I’m hourglass but have somewhat of a tummy so I don’t know if that makes me hourglass or the big oval lol
19611	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	The thing is: I don't know my shape. Just really long legs and tiny waist.
19612	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	What no one tells you about jeans: not a must to own a pair, linen or linen mix cotton pants are far more comfortable in the summer
19613	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Ok this video literally changed my mom’s life, like I convinced her to watch it and it inspired her to buy some more jeans, which lead her to totally updating her wardrobe and style (which she hadn’t updated in 20 years) and now she looks and feels amazing! Love your vids 💕💕
19614	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I'm a type 6... and I HATE high-waisted jeans. I feel like they make your butt look too long. Also, I have such a big difference between waist and hips that I'd actually rather minimize that appearance a little by wearing something mid-rise.
19615	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	For you wrist to your elbow(I think) is the same size of your waist.... so I guess that could help measure your size
19616	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Girl you are a jean scientist, a denimologist. I would go to your workshops on this. This was surprisingly fun to learn.
19617	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Title: What no one tells you about Jeans No one Me: Jeans are pants we wear😀 Even though we know it, no one really mentions they are pants😐
19618	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Does it work also for overweight people?
19619	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	This is for me if I ever need it 😩 *high wasted *darker colours *try jeans without space in between crotch and zipper *no large spaces between butt *put around neck to see if it will fit around waist
19620	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I always check the back pockets on jeans! Some make your butt look horrible lol and others make it look great like you said. Def a deal breaker for me even if I love the front.
19621	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	"I found your video & found it very informative & helpful, but I have a problem with the whole ""putting the waist of the jean around your neck & they will fit"" thing, I am a girl that has a large waist & small neck so it doesn't work for me lol"
19622	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Who else is happy that low and regular rise jeans are making a come back? I feel like high waisted jeans don't really flatter me and they're the only thing you could find for a while.
19623	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	whats fucking wrong with the thumbnail
19624	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Bless ur soul
19625	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	it’s so hard to find the perfect pair of jeans. i just want one where i don’t have to wear a belt with it. if i go for one that would fit my waist it will be too small and not get past my thighs. i have to find jeans that accommodate my thighs and just wear a belt to make the waist fit
19626	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	My problem is that i have small waist and every time i buy a jeans that's fit for my waist i can't use it because it doesn't go up from my thighs or up to my butt that's why I'm always ended up buying loose jeans and just put a belt so that it fits.
19627	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I'm very particular about the way I handle my laundry, and always hang dry delicates rather than wearing them out with the dryer; but I never thought about hanging my jeans til now.. Thanks for your beauty savvy insight!
19628	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	the thing is, it's almost impossible to find jeans without a space between the zipper and crotch 😫
19629	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I would say, the thing that bothers me the most is that I have a tiny waist comparing to my hips so I can't find the jeans that fit me, most of them are saggy around the waist and one more thing is that somehow all the jeans are short for me, they never reach nowhere close to my anckles... Any suggestions?
19630	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	The neck measuring is something my parents and every Asian parent teaches. Why does this work?!!
19631	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I've researched this video so many times... You have great tips. This video actually did change the way I buy jeans...and it's been a life saver during covid. Buying jeans without trying them on, I have criteria the jeans need to meet because of this video
19632	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Which brands do you recommend for jeans? Levi’s? I found Kendall and Kylie jeans are so soft and comfy I love it

19634	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I just wear baggy old school men’s jeans from goodwill. Really, there are more important things in life.
19635	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Been 2 years since I first watched this, I used this guide for maybe 6 months then gave up and went back to being a sweats potato
19636	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I’m a lowrise girl. But I can’t find them anywhere anymore. High rise do not compliment my body at all
19637	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	recently i've gained weight, i've tried 10 different types of jeans, was about to cry XD
19638	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	The fitting around the neck thing, doesn’t really seem to work on plus sizes, in my experience 😅
19639	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	"Her: ""there's just so much psychology when it comes to jeans"" Me *chokes on drink*: that my friend, is not the word, only if you're referring to visual illusions"
19640	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	imagine walking into a store and seeing someone putting the waist of a pair of jeans around their neck
19641	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I always thought that neck measurement thing was just an asian thing 😂😂
19642	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I love how positive this video is. No “oh you need to hide your belly if you have a muffintop”. This is facts and tips, no shaming :)
19643	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Who else got this in there recommended after 3 years
19644	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Men's jeans. They have a more standard sizing than women's, they have pockets that fit more than half a credit card, and you're not monetarily penalized for having long legs.
19645	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	no one: absolutely no one: youtube: *recommends it for me almost 3 years after it was published* me: c:
19646	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	The problem is that i’m an hourglass, but a really really thin hourglass, so nothing ever fits
19647	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Since the day I watched this video I’ve been using all of this criteria every single time I buy new jeans and it has never failed me. I don’t even have to try them on anymore, they just look amazing. Thank you.
19648	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	So I think I have either a pear or hourglass shape, but my hipdips are so big its hard to tell, whatever type of pants I wear there is a muffin top/fat rolls bc I'm just that fat, and the waist is always WAY too big, even when the legs are tight :(
19649	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	“A muffin top doesn’t exist, you’re just wearing the wrong jeans” 🤣🤣🤣. Yes queen! 🙌🏽
19650	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	“Once you understand your shape” Have you seen a Mexican wrestler?? Big back non exista to butt... Yup that’s me
19651	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	These are all great tips. I have a skinny neck and wear a size 12 though so I don't think that one would work for me lol
19652	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I wish they’d make jeans for woman with a big butt, fuller thighs and smaller waist.... most jeans are too loose on my back/waist
19653	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Who's neck is the same size as their waist? That's what I wanna know!
19654	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	“It’s going to be a tight fit on the waist” Me: what waist? I’m a frisking sphere with legs
19655	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Help!!! I have no hips and a small butt and need to find jeans 👖 ... all seem to be made for women with big butts and I am stuck lifting them up all the time ... and some jeans 👖 are made with a small waist which protruding out ... what the ????

19661	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Okay!!I really don't know my body shape but whatever I still love high waist jeans 👖!!
19662	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	If I wear low waisted jeans, I get huge muffin tops and in case of high waisted jeans, I can’t find the right size because I have thicccc thighs and a small waist in comparison. So it’s either too tight on the thighs or really loose on the waist😔
19663	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I bought some jeans secondhand from City Beach. I absolutely love everything about them, BUT, they have almost 2 strips of bleach, one down the side and the other from the front. The jeans are in very good condition and are still very firm, so I don't think they've been worn a lot, if at all. Any suggestions on how to fix this?
19664	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	2:09 bRuh wtf! I thought it's just a walking legs that has no body.
19665	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Her: If your shape is 4 then low rise My fat rolls: yussss get into it.
19666	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I have never looked at these things because I just want a pair that fits well enough to be comfortable.
19667	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Gah! I hate low rise jeans, hate 'em! I have no waist, and low rise jeans always feel like they're falling off. Sometimes they do fall off, my hip bones are in a weird place. This is why I prefer high waisted jeans. What now? How does one fix that? And I've been air drying my jeans forever.
19668	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I still can't figure out my body shape Because I have wide shoulders
19669	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Reminder: • high waisted •darker colors (maybe a few light 🥲) •long zipper(stay away from short ones) •small pockets not too far nor close from middle and not low •don’t throw in dryer,hang dry them •check to see if fit perfectly around your neck to see if they fit :)))
19670	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I've come to a point where I don't really care about what fits me or not. I just wear whatever I want and feel great about it
19671	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I’m not wearing jeans anymore lol. They’re just so uncomfortable.
19672	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	My experience: buttons are better than a long zipper.
19673	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Yes! Finally someone covers all the points that I look for in a jeans.
19674	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	just realized that i'm supposed to wear high-waisted jeans, but i spent all my money on low ones. i'm not even kidding, i have like 12 pairs, and have been trying to lose weight like crazy these past few months
19675	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Thankyou I needed this. Went through my jeans and I only have two pair now 😢😮
19676	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	My biggest No-No is a pair of pants / jeans that when you sit down makes you look like your dick is hard but you're a girl awesome especially these daysI'm sorry my apologies I'm not downing anyone seriously I just feel like there's enough confusion in the sexes that we don't need things like this going on I also just learned where realized myself actually that like shoulder pads and things like this are meant to hide those things for transgenders which makes sense because all those people in Hollywood I can't I just you know what I just noticed things a long time ago I'm so glad I found this video I have no females in my life no gays I don't even know how I would make a girlfriend being that people think I'm gay because I dress like a boy and rock a hat because I feel more comfortable with a hat on I don't know why so people just think I'm gay I get it all the time but I'm not not that I don't look at girls I'm just saying
19677	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	My butt is the only “curvy” thing about me. I just don’t want to emphasise it because people keep pointing it out😭.
19678	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I tried that 'neck technique' before , I also saw my mother, aunties, even my grandmother does it and it fits perfectly on them but to me it fits on my waist but on my but it's a struggle, my waist line is 28 inches (sometimes 27 when I'm hungry whahaha) and my butt size is 39 to 40 inches ‘︿’. Anyway thanks for the tips💕
19679	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	frankly speaking, i feel that low waisted jeans just look bad in general, like ( on girls ) high waisted just look so pleasing generally, is it just me?

19700	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	i have a pretty slim wait, a drastic curve from hips to waist, but my hips are kinda square plus hip dips so its kinda tricky for me

19702	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I have short legs and big butt. I like high rise to make legs look longer , but my butt will look saggy and make my ass flat look. I still dont understand my butt shape 😭. I always get frustrated when it comes to choose jeans .
19703	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I'm kind of confused with my shape. I have a tiny waist, big bust and an average butt. I don't necessarily have no hips, I think I have some hips. So am I a V shape or an hourglass?
19704	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	My favorite jean goes all the way down covering my ankle, I’m tall so this is rare. My shape is hourglass with violent hip dips that kinda ruin any pair of jeans so...:(
19705	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Hey, Does anyone have an idea where the best jeans are from ? I need high waisted jeans but eeeeevery high waisted jeans that I have tried on was waay to big on the waist. My figure is very curvy and I hate wearing a belt. Any ideas ?
19706	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	The only thing about high waisted jeans is like I feel like I don’t have a butt when I wear them!

19716	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Reminder for me: Dark colors Hugh waisted MAKE SURE POCKETS ARE BIG AND SPACED TO MAKE YOUR WHALE BUTT LOOK SMALLER
19717	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I’m really skinny but I have Thick thighs/but and chest
19718	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I’m an hourglass but my hip dips ruin my shape and make my curves seem smaller. I hate it.
19719	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	The problem is when the jeans fit at my waist they are wayyy to thin on my legs
19720	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I wear leggings so this is unnecessary for me
19721	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	She kinda sounds like Andrea’s choice to me
19722	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Finding the perfect jeans is honestly so hard when you have no curves. I am an inverted triangle, so my jeans are always loose around the hip part. Most of my clothes would look better if i had hips, the struggle is real ):
19723	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	"""once you understand your shape."" Me: *I look like Daddy pig*"
19724	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Thanks for this video. Finally ordered some stuff I’ve needed after watching this. Best part it was 60% off. New York and company is great jeans especially for us tall gals. Just picked them up for $20 a pair, 2 day free shipping. Wahoo.
19725	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Just going to put *this* here: I'm an inverted triangle, a very soft inverted triangle, meaning not extreme. For me (and most people), low-rise jeans are *not* appealing to the eye, especially when *high-rise jeans* are trendy. Mid-rise jeans are *hands down* my favorite! They compliment my body and draw attention to my hips (making my hips appear *curvier*). Hope this helps anyone!
19726	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I’m very skinny, a little over 110lbs, and I wear high waisted jeans since I wear crop tops and stuff. I always have the issue where I’ll have to wear a belt due to the waist not fitting tight but the thigh/leg part fits well.
19727	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Hey im 167 lbs and 5'4 dont tell me its the jeans
19728	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	this has literally made me feel so self conscious wearing jeans now
19729	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I hate the feel of high waisted, but that works for my body type. I feel more comfortable in either a low rise or mid rise. Is there any suggestions?
19730	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	like... every pair I buy is tight on my hips and baggy under the knees and down, the twist is that I'm not even thick and I don't have wide hips or thighs
19731	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Theres is a certain body shape Me: Is stick a body shape?
19732	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	As a guy I question why I am here... Ha nerds, y’all have small pockets to look cuter, well guess what? (Puts phone in back pocket, there’s like a centimeter to spare.) and you know what’s even better than that? (Puts phone in front pocket, oh no it’s too deep, I hafta fish it out of my pocket because there’s so much room). NYEHEHEH. Also baggy jeans are great because then I can have thick fabric that won’t rip when I fall, but since it’s kinda loose it’s not painful. GET DUNKED ON. *dabs*
19733	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Every Jeans just looks bad on me no matter what because my hip dips stand out so much
19734	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Reminder : •Light coloured to look bigger, dark to look slimmer •High waisted •Zipper has to be long •Pockets have to be small •Needs a space from pocket to crease •Measure around neck •Pockets not too close and too far away •Hang to dry

19754	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	People also have different butt shapes too. My butt is a “V shape” so high pockets make it look super weird. The pockets have to be like half an inch from the butt crease.

19763	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	"I don't think jeans are made for my body anymore. It's been 6 years since I found a pair of jeans that fit correctly and I've just switched to just leggings Edit: since the manbaby incel trolls are invading my comment, let me clarify. The reason it's hard to find jeans that fit me correctly is because I have wide hips. They'll either fit in the waist and be too tight on the hips, or they'll fit in the hips and be too loose in the waist. Just because I said ""jeans are not made for my body anymore,"" it isn't an invitation to call me fat and say I need to go to the gym. The fact you really feel the need to tell me to go to the gym, which will not change my bone structure one tiny bit, is laughable at best. Do something more productive with your time. Thank you."

But mid rise doesn’t look nice and low rise is just a disaster, curse my hip dips. I understand they’re natural it just makes buying jeans difficult. (Edit) Thank you everyone for your suggestions and support I will take them all into consideration! 💗💗

My hips are a lot larger than my waist, so any pants that fit my hips are too big for my waist. I saw a hack earlier of sewing elastic in them, so I might try that.

19847	241	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I've never heard a person call a butt soggy before. I found this super helpful btw.
19848	242	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Honestly I feel like my body type downwards triangle where I’m bigger from the top and smaller from bottom.

19855	249	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	"To anyone who tells themselves that they are not beautiful, or looks at a model and thinks... ""this girl is more beautiful ever be!"" I want you to know that that's the way people look at you. Everyone (even the models) look in the mirror, and see something wrong with their image. Something that maybe no one else sees. All of us are guilty of not loving ourselves enough. We look in the mirror, and we see something that needs to be changed. Be it our weight, our hair, face, skin. I want you to know that someone out there looks at you and says ""I wish I could be as beautiful as her"". Maybe you don't see it, but they do. We're not all equal by society's standards. But who said they're right? I want you to do something for me. I want you to remember this, the next time you say anything negative about yourself. Now go look in a mirror And instead of pointing out everything you see wrong Point out what you find about yourself to be most beautiful. I promise This can change your life Because beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
19856	250	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	my body shape is between 5-6 but i have some belly,, i think high waisted is rlly good but it might enhance my belly?? idk man.
19857	251	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	No one looks good in high waisted jeans Especially if you have the waist too tight and that will cause issues later if you wear them all the time.
19858	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I mean high waisted jeans tend to have better pockets so thanks for the hour glass
19859	253	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	These tips are great except for the last one. I tried it on one of my jeans that is too large for my waist, and it did not even fit around my neck. That specific tip will depend a lot from person to person I feel.
19860	254	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	*AlexandrasGirlyTalk* I'm already short with curvy hips. My whole life I was very small, maybe 100 pounds. Recently I had major stomach surgery after I died and was brought back. They were just in a big hurry and did a hack job. I'm not complaining. They could have had my arm as long as they saved my life. My mom also died of an awful cancer. Not that any of them are good. I gained 10 lb a month for 10 months. That's twice my size. Now my stomach is huge from stress and all of the muscles being cut and my hips are still very wide. So I'm short and fat.😢 I don't even know where to start for a pair of jeans or anything that would be semi flattering. Also I have a very hard time wearing anything that's binding on my stomach. I don't know if that will be forever or if I might heal someday. Do you have any suggestions? Thank you so very much. ❤☮
19861	255	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	What do you do if you are the first body type but absolutly hate wearing low rise jeans. I find them really uncomfortable and am worried about them slipping down all day
19862	256	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I can never seem to find high waisted jeans anywhere. So I'm stuck with low rise, no butt, and the muffin top.
19863	257	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	Do you have any favorite site for affordable jeans??❤️❤️
19864	258	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	when you said that my body type should wear low rise jeans i screamed 😂 (i only like high rise lol)
19865	259	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I literally can't find high-waisted jeans that fit me because I am really skinny and weirdly tall at the same time so jeans that fit my height are too big and jeans that fit my waist are too short 😬😬 well, I guess leggings exist for a reason 😂😂
19866	260	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	this are great tips but for a short Asian girl, it's really hard to find jeans that fits perfectly! I have yet to find jeans that has a perfect back pocket placement.

19886	280	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I’m really tall (like over 6 foot tall), but I have long torzo, not that long legs. It took me forever to find thing that fit me that I like and it still bothers me often So, if you have any ideas how to shorten my torzo and show of my body (I think I have great butt, but flat chest) I would be so happy!
19887	281	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I need some advice for a pear shape body
19888	282	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	9 million people die a year from starvation. Until this is resolved fashion is shameful. Save some lives or make my butt look nice? wtf happened to our society?

19896	290	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	One of my main issues with jeans is the zipper, or rather the fabric covering the zipper (if that makes sense). It never lays flat but instead creates an unflattering bulging effect. And the upper corner of that part, right above the button, always weirdly pokes out and almost makes it look like I have a belly button piercing poking out through my shirt or something. It's awful! Haven't worn jeans in years largely for this reason.
19897	291	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	“These are from H&M and really affordable” *H&M pants are $40*

19910	304	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs4U4_c-5A4	I really like your videos but I feel like people might be put off by you video cause there is no background music. I think this will make your videos even better. This is just my opinion. You don’t have to agree with me.

19985	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	One of the best ways to get clean nails after applying dark shade of nail paint is to brush ur nails using a soft tooth brush and some tooth paste. Believe me, it really works.. it's tried and tested..
19986	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	I bite my nails😖

19989	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	You said the cuticle is the dead skin you scrap off then you say the polish will pool up in the cuticle area so...what exactly is the cuticle? cause the polish can't pool up in 'the cuticle area' if the cuticle is actually dead skin all over the nail

20011	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	Your very first nail hack (about scraping dead skin off the nail) is actually very bad for your nails. It creates ridges and nail scarring and if you do it enough, your nails will always be ridged and uneven and will often split. You are suppose to push the cuticles back, then clip. #truthfromabeautychemist

20053	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	You should never push back or cut cuticles. It protects them from fungus and helps them grow. NEVER EVER SCRAPE YOUR NAIL BED. YOU ARE CAUSING RIDGES AND REMOVING PROTECTIVE LAYER. OMG. NEVER USE ALCOHOL OR PURE ACETONE. IT HELPS NAIL POLISH STAY LONGER BUT DAMAGES YOUR NAILS, MAKES THEM DRY AND BRITTLE.
20054	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	Amazing!

20057	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	Great Video and I agree that nippers can be intimidating but I think it is a very bad idea to scrape your nail with a metal object like that. You run the risk of going through layers of nail. You may know when to stop but girls at home trying this hack are going to be scrapeing away to get every bit gone. Can you suggest an alternative? How about cuticle trimmers (funky looking stick with the split blade) or the creams? What do you think?

20061	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	I am a girl and I LOVE painting my nails, but I feel as though guys should be mentioned in this video. You may agree with me on that guys should be allowed to paint their nails and just forgot to mention them...I just though I would mention it to bring it to your attention!! I feel very strongly about this subject so I thought that I should mention it, no hate!!

20073	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	what kind of cream did you put on your nails to make it thoroughly clean?
20074	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	My favorite nail hack was the dark polish one! I love dark polish and wear it often, but it really does get ALL over my cuticle/finger when I try to take it off... Will definitely be putting lotion on my fingers first from here on out! Thanks <3
20075	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	I like the hacks, good tips. But polish with no base coat was DRIVING ME NUTS. If you're going to give tips, the #1 tip should be to protect your nail with a clear coat.
20076	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	my first time to watch a video from you. i enjoyed and learned so much. i love how you are so straight to the point! saves on my precious data!
20077	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	This is the first nail hacks video that actually taught me things I didnt know. (not because I'm great at nails by any means) But the other videos I see are usually common sense stuff. Thank you so much!

20102	191	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	hold up....was the last hack saying that you could use nail polish to remove nail polish? Or did I get that wrong??
20103	192	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	I'm sorry but why does it sound like shes about to scream out laughing?
20104	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWc2VcsTjo	"I hate titles like that. Every ""girl"" ""SHOULD"" know. Presenting doing nails as a girls' thing and ""should""ing it makes girls who don't like to do their nails feel like they should because theyre a girl and men who like to do their nails like they should not because it is a ""girls"" thing. How about nails hacks every nail-lover or something should know. And it makes it much much better."

20131	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	natural scents are not any better than artificial fragrance/perfume. they're still have fragrant components and should not be put on/around the intimate area.
20132	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Am I the only one who have stretch marks on butts.
20133	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	She's naive about laser. It's really cheap these days and you don't need that many sessions. My underarms only took a few sessions. Best of all it's practically pain free!
20134	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Am I dumb but she said to exfoliate up and down and then says don’t exfoliate going back and forth at 3:15. What does that mean then
20135	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Can someone tell me.. what the green stuff was called?!?
20136	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Just for younger girls to know...not everyone is so lucky that hairs grows after 1,5 - 2 months. I need to wax every 3-4 weeks.
20137	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I wish we never had pubic hair bc it’s effort shaving it all the time
20138	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Hello. Can anyone help me? The link of I'm grown hair serum isn't working for me. What should I do
20139	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Her: “wear light coloured underwear” My period: *ratatata*
20140	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Laser hair doesn’t require that much cash. And it lasts for a month so it’s a pretty good option
20141	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I want to but I just feel like I’d be sooo uncomfortable and awkward getting it professionally done
20142	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Legit no one ever told me how to take care of my pubic hair. It just grew. But now it's gotten to the point where I'll be doing something and it will get pulled. Nothing hurts worse. So I had to learn how to shave and all that fancy stuff, and you made it pretty clear. Thanks lol
20143	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Im not 18 yet so i can get a Brazilian wax :(
20144	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	What is the name of the wax u are using in this video
20145	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	First of all, this video was very helpful, thanks. I'm sure it would help if I tried it out, but I... don't exactly know how to say... well, my bikini line is way worse than anything I've ever seen. Last summer I got rid of the hair down there with an epilator, but since then it keeps becoming worse and worse... I have lits of ingrown hairs, big, sore pimps or whatever they are, but they're painful, very big and red, and I cant do anything about them... if I can, I remove the ingrown hair, but then a big, dark spot stays there and won't disappear, and I'm not sure what to do... sorry I wrote it here, but I don't know who to ask about it... (and sorry for my English too, I tried my best, but I'm not from an English-speaking country)
20146	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	2:39 what!!! Exfoliating with this?? It barely tickled my skin! Shower tip : Girls, if you wanna deep exfoliate your skin get your hands on a moroccan olive soap and moroccan scrubbing glove, jump in a hot shower, water better be hot so that the pores open, apply the soap on your entire body leave it for few mins, rinse it and and start scrubbing and see all the black dead skin coming out trust me feel brand new.. you'll thank me and once you try it you'll never consider showering with a loofah. Just search moroccan exfoliating glove and moroccan black soap on Ebay. 🧖‍♀️🛀
20147	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Nothing compares to laser hair removal if you can afford it.
20148	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Is it just me or does she always sound like shes trying not to laugh? 🤔
20149	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Why am I watching this? I’m a 21 year old dude who likes anime and doesn’t go outside lmao

20151	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I need to wax every 2 weeks. And it still itches like hell even with waxing when the hair grows back.
20152	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Finally a girl with the same hair thickness as me. Waxing looks super painful though. 😂
20153	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Am i the only one who has no bikini line hair? Is that normal? I am 18
20154	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	But waxing hurts

20158	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF INGROWN HAIR PREVENTION by WIZKER THOU SHALL NOT TAKE PREP TIME IN VAIN! You should be using a warm/hot water prep (5 mins). Then leave the shaving creme on for more than 3 minutes to really soften the hair. The hair stubble should literally fall away with little or no pressure at all. Pressing hard is the problem! Be gentle ya'll. HONOR THY PRECIOUS SKIN! Too many blades! If you are prone to ingrown hairs then you don’t need 3 or more blades. THOU SHALT NOT USE DIRTY BLADES! Using a blade that's been used way too many times. Yes, this one may be obvious, but be sure to keep your used tools as clean as possible. Soap and rubbing alcohol will destroy bacteria. THOU SHALT NOT PRESS! Pressing grabs more of the hair follicle and while this might get you a closer shave, it will also guarantee ingrown hairs. Don’t press too hard on the skin with the blade. A gliding, light touch is all you need. THOU SHALT NOT PASS! PASS! PASS! Too many quick passes with the blade in the same area. One pass per hairy area – going 1-2 inches downward at a time – will prevent ingrown hairs. Always shave like you might cause damage, not like your mowing the front yard lawn. THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT OVER SHAVING! Scheduling your shaves too often. For example: shaving on Monday and then shaving on Wednesday. This rule is hard to follow, especially if you have to shave for your career but if you are prone to ingrowns, try shaving with an electric clipper. The results are not super close but no one but you will know the difference. Ladies, try waxing. THOU SHALT NOT GO AGAINST THE GRAIN! Shave WITH the grain means shaving in the direction of hair growth (usually down, but perform a face map to be sure). THOU SHALT NOT CLOG! Use of skin/pore clogging cremes or lotions. These keep hairs from growing up. After a shave, keep your skin bare; let the tiny army breath, and allow those newly shaved, really small, microscopic hairs to grow out just in time for the next shave. KEEP THY SMOOTH SKIN FREE! Avoid super tight fitting shirts around the Adam’s apple (neck) and/or constricting fabrics below the waistline region. REMEMBER TO EXFOLIATE! Exfoliation removes excess layers of skin and prevents shorn hair from regrowing towards the skin and from becoming trapped beneath the skin. Brushing teases the hairs away. Get WIZKER for your face or body region and use as directed.

20167	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Been getting my entire body waxed since forever but recently my sensitive skin has been way more sensitive after waxing and I’ve had pimples, inflammation, that last weeks. Especially my stomach for some reason. My skin straight up feels like it’s been through trauma. So I’ve been thinking of switching to shaving, just for my stomach and back maybe. And endure the breakout everywhere else just cuz I don’t think I’m ready to shave entire body. So if anyone has any advice on whether that’ll suit better, lemme know, thnx.
20168	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I want to try waxing, but I'm so scared. I feel like it's going to be so PAINFUL. Sucks that I have a really low pain tolerance 😥
20169	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I've tried all these, after so much waxing my hairs are thinner and it is even harder for them to poke through the skin. I've tried everything, am done looking for solutions, laser here I come !
20170	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Laser is the best option! I tried the philips IPL for home I brought the older Model which is not cable less! Check for older model some of them have offer you pay 200- 350$ and you can use it almost on every body parts! I have been using the Philips lumea advanced for 8 months my hairs are so much thinner some parts I barely have hair anymore! For me best investment ever!

20197	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	You are one of my favorite channels. You get into shit right away, it's always packed with intelligent info, and it's stuff no one has ever told me. Thank you!!

20204	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I have little tolerance for pain and I can't imagine waxing fown there... even the thought is so painful!
20205	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Her voice sounds like she's laughing the whole time
20206	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Completely unrelated, but your yellow nails make me really happy.😊😊😚
20207	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Ok but one of those look like a sensory wheel so tell me what’s really going on sis
20208	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Buy a good IPL on amazon. Shave and use your IPL afterwards... done. Your hair will grow back much slower and thinner and you won’t have to suffer anymore, plus goodbye to any ingrown hair ever. My dermatologist suggested it to me when I asked her if I could do something for my bikini area that was very irritated (bumps and redness+ingrown hair+ dry broken skin) by all the waxing I used to do. Worked like a charm. Ofc this method requires a bit of initial investment but you can find a good IPL for 200/300$ which you will gain back in no time by avoiding waxing sessions. Seriously, it’s SO worth it.
20209	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Let's be real, that sponge will not exfoliate. It's too mild. You need something more abrasive.
20210	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I know this is an old video but I had crazy dark coarse black hair. And every time I shaved no matter what I did, it just would itch so bad and get ingrown hairs and razor burn. VEET solved alot of that 😍 I ended up buying a groupon for 150 for 6 sessions and 4 years later I am more than 90% hair free. My laser technician was a Persian gal and a savage at the removal process. She cranked it UP and blessed me. Best money I ever spent. Go to Groupon guys!
20211	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Actually I get the darkness/pimples when I get brazilian waxing also it gets a bit thick and itchy I‘m trying to find another way to get of my hair 😪
20212	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	My higher inner thighs get really dark (almost black) and it looks like I have pimples there. It’s super weird and I don’t think it’s normal and I try to exfoliate down there and stuff but nothing is removing the dark spots. Not to mention the pimples look like black heads but at the same time they don’t. I don’t know what to do.
20213	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	That sounds like a lot of works... Glad that I’m Asian I rarely grow any hair
20214	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	i hate the word panty
20215	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I use an Epilator every week to diminish the pain. Works well if you are someone who will keep to the schedule.
20216	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	What kind of razor is that in the thumbnail ??
20217	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I had SUCH a bad brazilian wax back in February and I can’t get myself to go back. The girl was the same age as me (ironically enough it was someone I followed on instagram) and she didn’t do it properly. She was ripping at skin, not warning me when she was so I was breathing so heavy to try and not scream and she NEVER applied pressure after each section. I was in so much pain and my legs were actually shaking. I’m seriously traumatized 😂
20218	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I'd love to see more on the derma roller, I think I need to use one of these! x
20219	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	After i shave my hooha i apply a layer of white deodorant and it works amazing, no bumps and no darkness.
20220	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	You really have great videos! This was so informational, and you said things I've never even thought of-- and had solutions for them.
20221	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I love how you said “hair removal is always an option” 👏🏻👏🏻
20222	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	"Great advise!!! I've been waxing myself since my early 20s (I'm 40), I never had it done professionally so it took me some time to learn how to do it correctly. My go to wax is Sally Hanson's Lavender Spa Wax Kit. I cut the strips in half twice (into 4""x2"" pieces) which are a lot easier to work with and less painful."
20223	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I do feel sorry for the boys
20224	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	3:58 does it help with armpits too? I get ingrown hairs and dark spots there
20225	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I don't like the general message here because I feel you are promoting the use of multiple products which will be expensive and are not necessary. I don't have dark coarse hair like you do but the principal is always the same. Shaving promotes ingrowing hair and spots and always leaves a shadow. Waxing will also cause ingrowing hair and spots if you fail to exfoliate. Bottom line for both ways is simply to remove the hair, exfoliate the skin regularly and moisturise. I've been waxing my bikini line for 20 years at home and there is nothing more straightforward. Beauty regimens need not and should not be so expensive. Other than that I think your videos are really good
20226	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I do my own brazilian 😭 I’ve been doing it for three years now. It’s messy in the beginning, but you get a lot better at it and learn to be flexible lol. It’s 100% doable and you have to have a higher pain tolerance. :-)
20227	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	*James charles aka shishta should've watched this before coachella*
20228	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	How do those girls stay hair free and have beautiful skin all summer? I find that impossible to do and my skin is my biggest insecurity. I dont know how they do it but I envy them so bad
20229	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I don’t see any dark spots on her. I have REAL dark spots that are much more noticeable and wish someone with a severe case would demonstrate a solution.
20230	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Regualr waxing made my thighs even darker, I've been doing sugar waxing and it's been the best! Swear it's better than anythingggg, even laser hair removal because it's safer and natural!
20231	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	every two months?! My hair grows very fast🙁 I need to go waxing every week
20232	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	When I get waxed.. my hair is full grown by the 7th day ☹️
20233	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	i'm so glad i found this. I thought my bikini line wasnt normal because i only ever see flawless ones all over social media. THANKYOU FOR MAKING ME FEEL NORMAL <3
20234	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Wow James Charles didn’t see this one
20235	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	"""Its a really un-sexy bottle.. "" 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
20236	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	An anesthetician told me after 33 or so years of my life that you get even more ingrown hair if you use razors with more than 2 blades because it cuts too close to the skin. And she was so right (and I hated that no one told me that before). And then I went for the laser (keep an eye on Groupon ladies, that's what I did). I had ingrown hair like crazy before (so no confidence on the beach) and now I have none, zero, nada. So yeah, laser is not always perfect (not 100% of the hair will be gone), but the ones that are left are thinner. have to shave from time to time (with a 2 blades razor) but just the fact that I have no ingrown hair changed my life.
20237	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	"""the brazilian"" LOL in Brasil we just call it waxing ahaahaha"
20238	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Ok this was extremely helpful, thank you
20239	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Has anyone used cream to bikini line? Like... I usually shave (I cannot cope with wax, it hurts me SO much) and would love to try cream.
20240	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Omg you sound JUST like AndreasChoice 😳
20241	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I’m so glad I found your channel! I finished my last laser hair session 6 months ago and that ish saved my life. No hair ever. Now I just need to get rid of scars. Thanks so much for this vid!!
20242	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Where did u buy these underwear (online) cuz I live abroad. Find it hard to find almost fully cotton underwear
20243	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	what style of panties are you wearing? I really like them 😂😂😘
20244	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	so i need some advice. i am only 16 (not old enough to go get a Brazilian wax) and i cant wear bikinis because of how dark my hair is. even if i shave i see dark spots where the hair is and its super embarrassing so i always have to wear running shorts. suggestions?
20245	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Iv wanted to switch to waxing, and i know professional's have seen it all, but i just cant bring myself to go and do it. Can you bring someone in with you? Im sure its super painful. What can i do before i go to make it less painful and make me less anxious? Love the video thank you!!
20246	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Does anyone have tips for dark skin around bikini lines? I think it’s due to years of chaffing between my thighs bc I have bigger thighs/was overweight before
20247	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Those panties you showed was super Pretty do you have info on that?
20248	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I thought you stopped using nail polish.
20249	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	This seems helpful sadly I don't have the money and it would be awkward to ask my mom :(
20250	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I don't have hair in the bikini line, am I the only one?
20251	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Hey Alexandra just wanted to request a video on ways to remove vaginal hair.. i know this might seem like an inappropriate question but some of us cannot afford to get a Brazilian wax all the time. So would really like to know different methods of vaginal hair removal... Much love to you!
20252	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Yessss please dermarolling video with links!That are cheap if possible
20253	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Hey Alexandra! Quick question - do you think the derma rolling and products for dark spots would also work for underarms?
20254	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I used to get razor burn and ingrown hairs and all that shaving, and I still shave but now what I do is use disposable men's razors only use them once, and instead of shaving against the hairs I shave it sideways and I'm smooth as a baby. I'm not about having a stranger rip out my coochie and ass hairs for money 😂👍 also put some tea tree oil and aloe Vera from the plant on it after you shaved and it will feel so smooth
20255	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Where are the underwear you showed from? I have trouble finding cute comfy cotton underwear
20256	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I am very pale yet i have darker areas where the sun don't hit lol,i exfoliate those areas but its not much of a difference,is that even normal? It should be pink considering how damn pale i am...frustrating.😒
20257	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I have a problem with my skin all over my body where I get tons of ingrowns to the point it just looks like I have goosebumps 24/7 I've tried everything to help my skin get clearer but nothing seems to work I rarely shave too. If anyone has any advice can y'all let me know?
20258	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	I get super embarrassed about this and it’s nice to have a YouTuber that is so honest and open about something like this. I will be using these tips. LADIES DO NOT WAX BIKINIS YOURSELF. I’ve never been professionally waxed but I wanted to try so I ordered a kit and did the unspeakable. Let me just say HELL NO TO THE NO NO NO. On a 1-10 scale it would be 100 as in impossible. I was shaking by my third strip the further down I got and thought I was going to pass out. My mother laughed herself to tears as I tried googling how to remove it because I couldn’t face the pain of the third strip.
20259	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	Do you all find waxing your bikini line by yourself so difficult? I have always done it by myself and it is not big deal 🤷🏼‍♀️
20260	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	What brand wax did you use?
20261	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	What kind of wax do you use?!
20262	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	EXFOLIATION IS A SAVIOR!!!!! IF I ever get an ingrown I dab tea tree oil on it and it helps so much! I enjoy your videos so much! I really appreciate your care & wisdom!
20263	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	You are raw and i love that. We all have the same issues, why fake it. Thanks for being real and brave lol

20265	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	"i didn't get when she said ""bad thing about waxing is you have to wait"" wait for what?"
20266	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSRL3gHgZQ	You’re one of my favorite people to watch on YouTube! Your videos are honest and so realistic and has helped me so much! Thank you! I would definitely like to see a video on Dermarolling and how you clean it between use. I too struggle with my bikini line n ingrown hair because my hair is thick, coarse, and curly. I always look forward to your videos and get so excited to see you upload. Because of you, I’ve been wanting to self-pamper myself at home :)

20294	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Your concealer is way to light and this was horrible. I would recommend using a darker shade of concleaer or one which is a bit close to your skin tone
20295	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Can we just appreciate how much she has improved from this point

20310	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I do like the forehead idea. But, the concealer is too light. Go a shade darker and warmer
20311	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	What a mess. definitely not attractive and the colors are horrible
20312	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	The highlighter under her eyes is just too much.!
20313	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Sorry it looks pathetic
20314	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Fix your nose Alexandra😖😖😖
20315	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	for me i think its really bad i do not like that and all my friend also and the bad one only this video
20316	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	No. No. No. No. No. No. No! The concealer was waaaay too light and I think you face looked extremely greasy when you were done. You are so pretty and don't even need that much make up!
20317	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I really don't understand how people can put on eye makeup before face makeup I do the opposite 😬
20318	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	what happened to your nose...?
20319	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	i need contouring tutorial for bitches that dont have that MAC shit 😂 i needa get me some
20320	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	DAMN PLEASE STOP THIS, ITS HORRIBLE, STOOOP I HATE THIS AND ALL THE MAN HATE THIS!
20321	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	The highlight color she's using is wrong, even if she wants it really white
20322	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Okay I tried this and followed it step by step and it looked like I had a bad tan on my face really horrible
20323	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Who of you think too that she would look even more beautiful with none or very rare make up?
20324	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Ok interesting to watch but in real life I approache very much girls but very rarely girls with such an amount of makeup... cause I don´t like it and it always looks like that such girls have to hide or to cover something... The most friends of mine have the same oppinion... Girls do make up shit to attract guys but when they get less approached why do they do that???
20325	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	not hating but personally I think your concealer was a little bit to light but it was a good video and helpfull for people who want to contour. I coudn't do it better ;) You make awesome video's! don't let the haters stop you 😘
20326	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	there is literally no point of using foundation if you're putting all this product on your face. it really defeats the purpose.
20327	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	omg you're so pretty
20328	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	she looks like a gay
20329	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	ewww why do girls do this
20330	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	So much effort. I'd rather go out and just be a 3/10 than go through all this
20331	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	She's really pretty, but the make up and highlighting made her face look why to white!!
20332	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I love how she doesn't have a intro because most youtubers go ON AND ON but she gets straight into it ❤️
20333	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Wow so many hateful comments. This girl is gorgeous and doesnt need to explain shit to anyone. The people who have negative things to say are probably not too confident in themselves, so they feel the need to attack someone that they feel are better looking than them.....just a thought
20334	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"Why is everyone giving her hate?! She's just trying to help the people who are still learning how to use contour.. If you don't like it then don't comment. Who cares if she's ""ugly"" who cares if her makeup isn't ""good""... Who cares if she isn't perfect? Nobody is, and nobody will be. So just accept who she is, and accept the fact she's trying to help people. snm👍🏻"
20335	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Am I the only one thinking this looks really bad on her?
20336	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	You look better without makeup..
20337	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	This comment is for you ladies who feel the need to talk down about someone's looks. All it screams out is insecurities and jealousy! Those two traits together are disastrous! Your not perfect, nobody is. Bullying only makes you ugly.
20338	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I feel like the highlight is a bit too light, I don't know. Maybe it's a shade too light?
20339	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	The highlighting shade is who knows how many shades WAY too light for her skin tone. it just ends up looking like bad costume makeup. She has tanned or a naturally medium skin tone. She's using practically white with a pink undertone highlight which is just.. not correct in my opinion. The darker contour is.. okay. I still feel like that's also an incorrect colour, but it's not so offensive to my eyes. This is just my opinion though, and she of course has a right to wear what makes her comfortable. Uh... As for her nose... Idk? She has a very pretty face in my opinion? Idk what else to say on that topic...
20340	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	WHAT IF U HAVE OILY SKIN?

20355	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Why is everyone hating ? I've not seen one nice comment apart from the people defending her from the hate ! Y'all need to get a life !! Go outside and play children! Stop hating on her! She can do much better than what you all can do no doubt!! You all need to go back to when you were 5 to learn about saying an opinion that's not nice but instead of saying it just keep it in your head pls! For all you haters out there, get a life.
20356	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	not hating, you are really pretty, but when you have a small nose by nose jobs, why would you put bronzer on the outsides to make it bigger?
20357	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	جميل جدان روعه
20358	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Weirdest nostrils ive ever seen in my life

20360	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Why is everybody being so mean?? Andrea is absolutely beautiful, AND by the way, even if she did get a nose job (which doesn't even matter because she is OBVIOUSLY gorgeous) why would it concern you??
20361	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Just by looking at these bad comments about this video makes me sick. Her contour and highlight is fine, there is nothing wrong? it actually suits her, please stop with the negative harsh comments.
20362	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Sorry but her nose is too small for her face
20363	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	You guys honestly need to remember that this was two years ago and her make up skills have gotten a lot better trust me stop hating on someone I mean I know her make up did not look the best but it's been like two years and she's learned a lot look at her recent videos
20364	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	روعهه
20365	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Is this a drag make up tutorial?
20366	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Just ridiculous!!! With all that on her face at beginning she looks like she part of a tribe in Africa & the finishing doesn't look as finished at all!!! Why woman do this to themselves? I prefer on special occasions just foundation and mascara & my skin really thanks me every day!!! Why you like to be FAKE ???!!!!
20367	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Look at all these ugly girls talking shit, if you don't like it just STFU , she's trying to help. Let's see your contouring skills... Oh wait, YOU DONT HAVE ANY BECAUSE YOUR OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT VIDEOS OF HOW TO CONTOUR. Plus she said she does this on special occasions, she looks beautiful before and after , she's just enhancing her beauty.

20373	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"This is too much. ""YouTube makeup artists"" and I use that term very loosely have think they discovered something new. Drag queens have been doing this for decades. Now you have a whole lot of women walking around looking like AMATEUR drag queens. Stop already!!"
20374	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	So White HAHAHA so unnatural
20375	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	She should close her mouth! It's not cute when she thinks she's hot by opening her mouth
20376	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Wayyyyy too much highlight under the eyes
20377	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"lemme get this straight...instead of telling girls to get adequate sleep, you just recommend slapping on some pale gloopy ass color under their eyes to look more ""alive and awake"". Instead of promoting healthier foods and encouraging girls to take up more activity in order to obtain a natural healthy glowing skin, you just show women how to cake on their faces with some overpriced toxic shit that just irritates their skin, gives them breakouts, hormonal disruptions and cancer . its clear you are not an advocate of real natural beauty. you're just alexandra the fake ass looking clown, whos pure existance is to misguide people whilst gaining more views."
20378	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	What if they don't make concealer lighter than my skin .-.
20379	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	yall some haters :(
20380	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Oh man, this is too much! Why would you want to have such white ghostly-looking undereye and cheek area?
20381	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	it's weird how you want to make your chin and nose appear more pointy... my chin and nose are naturally too pointy and i want to make them look flatter haha
20382	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Worlds worst contour routine
20383	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Your suppose to put foundation on first or over your contour.. Girls or boys please don't make this mistake as a makeup artist this is a must do tip I tell all my clients
20384	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	you are stunningly beautiful and i want to see you on ANTM cause i know they will love you!
20385	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	That's way too much contouring...Girls don't do this..use a little bit of make up and not this...it looks plastic.
20386	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	horrible contouring OMG it's better to do this for halloween but not for everyday !
20387	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	that nose job is TERRIBLE
20388	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	This is so fucking nasty and unnatural. I wouldn't do the powder because that would mean it would be caked on my face all day! Yuck!
20389	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	She is pretty but that highlight and contour was a joke
20390	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	looking forward to see you on ru paul drag race season 8 ! Honey please don't tell people you never had a nose job, your voice alone betrays it ! Gurl please ! And darling , don't do your eyes before contouring, this is wrong, go back to watching drag queen's video and learn from the real thing ! I never had a nose job ! hahahaha that was brilliant, you beg a belief !
20391	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Do girls really do this on a regular basis? I'm just looking at this for cosplay, but is this like an everyday thing? I'm way too lazy to do that...
20392	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	why does everyone look like kim k nowadays? why cant mainstream people look cute... like josh dun... even if he's a man. idk.
20393	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	You are beautiful the way you are. Don't beat up your face just to show someone how u look with makeup
20394	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Why is everybody being so mean?!! She has never had a nose job, she doesn't look like a horse, and she's just naturally beautiful but trying to look sexy because this is a video! If people watched the whole video, they would know this isn't her everyday look. People are just so upset with their own lives that they have to hate on someone else who is amazing! ❤️
20395	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Soo I'm a cross dresser trying to figure out this contour thing, but what I can't understand is how this video has majority likes BUT A LOT of hateful comments with thumbs up on them. Is this some primal jealousy thing? feels kind of hostile in the comments section just saying lol! Seriously if her makeup is that bad please comment the reason/s why so some of us can learn.
20396	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	The finished look didn;t look blended at all...pasty white in some parts, and dark reddish brown in others!! You used WAY too much of the highlight color!
20397	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I don't care what other people are saying, she is extremely stunning. She has such a unique look and it's so beautiful
20398	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	You're very beautiful but that is too much for a day to day routine. If I had that on I would feel like I guess fake because it's too much. Idk how to describe it I guess maybe thick or cakey? Idk but Sorry if I offended you but I just think it's too much.
20399	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Where do you buy your blending sponges ?
20400	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	i think your trying ay to hard to be sexy and your nose?..... whats wrong with your nose, and your lips look really big also that looked like so much product then you said something like add more if you need to... wow
20401	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"I read a lot of the comments and thought ""What the heck, I'll state my opinion, too."" This is just my opinion, so I understand not everyone thinks the same way as me. For one, She is really pretty. With or without makeup. Two, I do believe that the highlight she used was WAY too light, at least for her skin tone. If she would have used one a few shades darker, it would come out with a more natural colour. Three, You should always do your contouring and highlighting BEFORE doing your eye makeup. I don't know if that applies to everyone, but I would do my eye makeup last. And lastly, who cares that she is wearing a lot of makeup? If a girl doesn't wear a lot or none at all, you guys would make fun of her for not being 'perfect' or having uneven skin and stuff like that. And either way, girls wear makeup for themselves- not to impress you. So, yeah."
20402	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Is this a joke???
20403	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	such a botched nose job... looks terrible... makeup just as bad
20404	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I enjoyed watching this, but that highlight is waaaaay to bright for you, girl. Highlight and contour shades should not be any more that 2-3 shades lighter or darker than your skin tone… not 4 like I heard you say…
20405	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	If thats a noise job then she needs a refund because it looks so weird especially with her weird teeth
20406	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Did she get a nose job cuz
20407	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Who did your nose?
20408	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	she used too much highlight

20412	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	If you think this looks natural you're high as hell it really looks like you dumped your face in a bucket of powder
20413	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Is this a joke video? 😂😂
20414	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Why do you contour your nose when you've spent like $20,000 already on multiple nose jobs.. I'll wait ....
20415	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	dude shes such a pretty girl but her facial expressions look like she tries way way way to hard to be sexy its annoying
20416	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	what the actual fuck? No girl. Just no!
20417	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"""Because I'm using such a bright highlight and such a dark contour, that middle color is really perfect for my skin tone and *that gradient is really what's going to make the look more natural*."" Girl, there is nothing natural-looking about this look."
20418	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"Geez! So much jealousy on here it's ridiculous! If you ""KNOW"" so much about makeup and contouring then DON'T watch this video and make one yourself. This is for people like me or others who may need help or guidance on where to apply the contour makeup."
20419	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	This isn't a good job 😕 you can't use the average nose contour tricks with a nose like that. Contour and hi light are supposed to help correct and reshape. I saw no correcting on that 👃🏻.
20420	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Is it just me or is her face crooked
20421	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	You look like a ghost. This is rather stage makeup to resemble a zombie/ghost not even close to everyday makeup contour/highlight.
20422	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"I hate these highlight/contour videos because instead of showing how to highlight and contour the parts of your face that should be highlighted/contoured, it basically goes with the concept ""where ever there's not a contour, there's a highlight"". Where's the room for your actual skin colour to be on your face.."
20423	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	This is terruble
20424	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	No woman should wear so much make up on her face if she is not on a stage in some theatre. This is a mask... How will your boyfriend kiss that face...
20425	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Oh man, this video... whoever thinks this is nicely done knows nothing about makeup. I'm not even gonna get into the subject of being pretty or not, because it's so personal (even though I find it tragic), but, oh god. Terrible.
20426	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Natural beauty is best! No. No. No. She does NOT wear makeup for you asswipes, she wears it for herself because she likes it and it's fucking fabulous. Deal with it.
20427	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Highlight and contouring like this was originally for drag, to make a man look like a women. If you already have women features highlighting and contouring like this will only make you look manly. @***** explains it on his channel very well. Ppl have took highlighting and contouring to a whole other level.
20428	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	What's wrong with her for head and nose!😆😂😂✌️
20429	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Has she had surgery on her nose ? It looks like Michael Jacksons nose. Not being rude just wondering btw :)
20430	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Looks artificial and stupid thou... I can clearly see where you have put all this concealer and highlighter. Its white as hell! You CANT blend it in! Dont even try!
20431	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	You're too cute♡
20432	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Hi, what was the pallete in 0:02 Thanks for the vid!
20433	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I don't tend to contour much, I think it looks really nice, but I'm very very pale so often times a lot of products just are too warm toned for me. It's difficult to find cooler toned products it seems. A lot of pale girls use NYX blush in Taupe to contour (it really doesn't look like a blush, not sure why it's in the blush line lol), & I've tried it, but it's still not quite as cool toned as I'd like. Do those Anastasia colors come individually? I saw one in the palette that might work for me, the light one in the upper row in the middle.

20435	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	this is horrible :S sorry, but your technique is not good and it doesn't look that nice on you
20436	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	you look really creepy ......
20437	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Great. This is a technique used by celebrity make up artist Mario Dedivanovic who does Kim Kardashians Makeup EVERYDAY! I know this as I've been trained as a MUA by him when I was in NY. It ALWAYS look too much when you first start, but the secret is blending, Blend away and you'll get a flawless finish!! Well done girl!! X
20438	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Omg ... Jesus Christ ! Her face looks like burned from boiling water ...- if she had an accident like this then I'm really sorry - but if it's from beauty surgery I say OH MY GOSH ! Looks like a character from Michael jack sons thriller music video .
20439	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I've never used to brush to blend only my sponge so thank you for posting this! I'll try your method. Also don't listen to the meanies lol
20440	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Did she have something done?
20441	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Some people are so rude. I know its your opinion but could you try being nice about it. She gets hate comments like everyday, give her a break. She is a great Youtuber and doesn't need your negative attitude. If you don't have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything. Your behind a screen saying rude things because that's your only chance to bring people down. You wouldn't say none of that in reality because you would probably end up with a bloody nose, and a black eye.
20442	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"makeup should be to enhance and correct. You face is obviously lean, you should use highlighting and contouring to correct that and you didn't. For example your nose and chin, the points that are higher up should be contoured to match with the other sides. All you did was make your ""problem areas"" more obvious by highlighting them. You should use highlighting and contouring as a tool to give the illusion that your face and facial features are symmetrical. If you continue to do this technique you will never really see the true magic of makeup. Follow or checkout @makeupbalo on Instagram, she is very good at this. (CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM)"
20443	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	BEAUTIFUL! I love the technique of the more neutral highlight around the jawline... the only thing doll is the highlight is too light for your beautiful skin tone. I would keep it no more that two shades lighter than your foundation, and probably a different undertone. It was just too white, but overall beautiful outcome. For photoshoots this would probably be very beautiful for the camera! Many celebrity artists do dramatically light/bright contour for photoshoots. Also your forehead is not big at all... I don't know why you think it is but please know your forehead is fine and you are gorgeous! Don't let the hateful comments on this video bug you.
20444	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I get the point and shading, but i find that when you do it with so much heavy liquid makeups - it never comes out looking natural. Why not use dry pigments?
20445	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Waaaaaaayyyy too much under eye concealer too much highlight
20446	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	The Concealer under your eyes is a way to light!
20447	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I feel like you used way to much product you prob could have used half the amount and gotten the same effect without all the work and heaviness
20448	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Stop saying you have a big forehead. If THAT'S big, then I must have a monster forehead, but no one's ever said anything about it. I hope you aren't saying that because you were bullied about it, cause they were just jealous. Anyway, good job. You didn't need so much highlight though, and the only place you'd actually need contouring is on your nose, since it's oddly shaped. But you're overall naturally beautiful. Tone it down a bit.
20449	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Well if this is the way to do you make-up, then i'm doing it wrong
20450	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I just subscribed to your channel!!!! I'm super super awesome at doing hair but make up isn't my greatest skill... Can you get the same results without using fancy products?
20451	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	You need to come and do my makeup! I suck at it
20452	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"Whenever the word ""natural"" was used I laughed a little inside."
20453	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	"Thank you so much for posting this. I'm just getting started in drag and I have no idea how to do make up. A lot of the other videos I've watched never really explained it like you did, it was more like "" do this and this"" without any further explanation. Thank you so much, you've made my night :)"
20454	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	You had plastic surgery on your nose ?
20455	171	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	As a black girl (and a pretty dark one at that) I find it hard to find a shade to contour with. Can I still highlight though?
20456	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	I wish I could do this but the colour of your highlights is my skin tone and I've not been able to find a lighter colour or a darker colour that doesn't make me face look dirty... #palegirlproblems
20457	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Wow that's a whole lot of product

20460	176	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Looks awesome--you make it look so easy! Have you ever contoured with just powders over set foundation?
20461	177	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	Looks gorgeous babe!
20462	178	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	New subiii love your channel! Keep going👍👍💋

20466	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	So... we don't need any foundation? Or did you out foundation on prior to the vid? Looks great!
20467	183	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L414AMdFIAg	That is cool how you uploaded a video. I was thinking about how to contour my face for the past week and i was gong to see and hen when i got on you had a video of how to do it! :)

20502	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	As a fashion stylist, here is my number one rule for dressing sexy. Wear what your want, be comfortable, and own it. Remember you're beautiful in your own beautifully you way.
20503	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Why the hell it recommends me am not even a girl wtf jeez..
20504	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	First: I think your tips are great. Thank You. Second: A lot of women need more self-esteem. Third: Even more women need more confidence in themselves, in their body and in the shape it comes. This is not about shaming someone for not being perfect or someone for being too beautiful.
20505	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Ma’am. I can’t be sexy if I’m disgusting and ugly
20506	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Why are ya'll so _negative_ if you're not slender as she is, the tips still work, it's about the way you carry yousslf as well, man. Stop downing yourself

20521	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Idk why but she always reminds me of Jessica Davis from 13 reasons why
20522	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	"Them: ""Covering all your body in black, Can make your body look sexy"" With my friends: ""Is there a funeral rn?"""

20524	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Another hack is to smell really good but different than others. Find a scent that matches you and that hasnt been done before a million times. Make that your signature scent and people will perceive you as sexy just by your smell.
20525	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I’m asexual why am I here Not complaining though

20557	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I completely agreed with this until the last coat, that is possibly one of the ugliest pieces of clothing I've ever seen.
20558	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I agree with everything she says however I still think that your physical appearance is what makes you look sexy. Clothes can do that just to a certain extent. She has a naturally sexy vibe with those big lips, cat eyes and long hair. Even with the most modest clothes she will look sexy and beautiful. That doesn't apply to an average looking girl.
20559	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I love your mustard gold camisole, where do you get them? Thank youu..

20569	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I'm really curvy, it's so hard to find pants that will go over my hips
20570	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Wat if I fat tho???
20571	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Did she just say you get frumpy once you hit your twenties? What? SMH

20574	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I wish I could keep her in my closet and then any time I had to get dressed in the morning or for what ever reason, she could just step out and coach me on what to wear
20575	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I really dont know how so many girls wear leggings as pants. If I did that I would feel naked. LEGGINGS ARE UNDERWEAR FFS
20576	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Damn are you related to Andrea? They sound exactly the same! Holy shit
20577	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	It also helps if you're slim and beautiful, but with some curves
20578	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I wish I could afford any of this
20579	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Ok so this is really good advice but I also feel like this is exclusively for girls who are 120
20580	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	What about styling for very skinny tall girls with no curves?
20581	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Okay now the only problem is my acne farm face
20582	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I should probably start thinking about working out again...
20583	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	“Red” will make you sexier *works at Target* 😂
20584	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I clicked on this and it made me feel bad bout myself cause she’s so pretty and perfect and I’m so not 🤷🏼‍♀️
20585	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	When you are chubby/fat and you know this tips will never work on you but you still watch it because she is pretty😂😂
20586	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	A mi me parece una hortera vistiendo, pero claro para gustos los colores.. yo no me pondría la mitad de lo que se pone ella aparte de que no soy una barbie.. es todo muy feo para mi gusto...
20587	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Been watching you since middle school. Now I’m graduating high school. We stan❤️
20588	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Pleas who a how to DRESS UNDERNEATH CLOTHES I simply don’t understand
20589	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Step 1: weigh between 110-125 lbs
20590	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	My fav sexy item has always been a fitted turtleneck. It's showing off your silhouette without *actually* showing anything off - leaves more mystery for the guy :)
20591	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Funny thing This only works on girls already fine as hell (like yourself) I weight more and I don't think I'd get any other reaction besides mockery
20592	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	What if you're ugly lmao
20593	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Tbh it's easy for you, when you are so fkn beautiful and thin.
20594	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	i wish i’d watched this video when i was 13, honestly girls need this 💓
20595	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I'm too fat to look sexy
20596	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	What if you aren’t pretty?
20597	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I think this video is pretty interesting, BUT I caught myself thinking one thing. Let's face the truth: you don't need much to look sexy if you already have nice face, beautiful skin, high density hair and right proportional body.
20598	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	but, you're already beautiful
20599	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Girls! Dress however you want! Being sexy/good looking is not the only thing we can be. Spend your time on accepting your body/making your body healthier and stronger, eat well to be healthy, focus on your mental health, spend time with friends, find a hobby. This video sends two messages: you have to be extra thin with hips and boobs (basicly the perfect body only some can achieve) in order to be sexy and being sexy is your job, something you MUST do. If you are feel better in more comfy clothes That’s ok! If you like leggins, that’s also ok. This woman has no right to tell you what you can and cannot wear (I only wear leggins at home so no, I was not personally attacked but her Comment surely made some women feel like they are less than her)
20600	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	As if being sexy is my first concern...
20601	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Yooo the “guy” I’m cackling 😂
20602	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I love wearing more tighter revealing clothes but not to be sexy for others but I myself think my body looks amazing and beautiful in them but I also think I look sexy in a 4xl shirt with some nice socks or mom jeans sexy is your confidence and how you present yourself
20603	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I was watching this all excited to start dressing myself better and doing all this shit to look hot, and then I realized that I have an objectively unattractive body. Like, I'm not even fat. I'm like a really perfect weight for my height, but I just have a massive back and shoulders, a tiny head and an ugly face. I'm never gonna be able to be hot, it's just not in the stars for me. Oh well. Thanks for the tips tho.
20604	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I look twelve I'm seventeen. Should I be feeling sexy looking twelve lmao?
20605	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Omg can u please make a video of how to dress under your clothes.
20606	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	What if your mom picks out your clothes and you want to look sexy?
20607	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I'm so glad i found this. And i feel like every young girl should see this. Because girl, that's the thing. Actual feminime beauty.
20608	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Yes but you are not a plus size so I feel like :l
20609	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Where can I buy that pink jacket, so adorable
20610	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Lol it's just that easy to be sexy when you're not built like a little boy like me lmao
20611	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Why does she remind me of Andrea's choice?
20612	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	She lost me at no leggings
20613	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	What kind of fabric is your camisole?
20614	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Step 1. Be skinny and beautiful Step 2. Done
20615	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Can you please do a video on how to dress when you’re on that time of the month. As in like what might be best to wear when you’re bloated so you can still feel confident, and what fabrics are best to wear and what fabrics we should avoid??
20616	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I'm going to tell the truth. As a guy, I can say that the only thing we look at are: Ass, face (especially the eyes), and chest. In that order. Of course personality plays a part but that only matters if the guy likes your physical appearance in the first place. (Everything that I said here applies to most guys and most of the time, not all guys or all of the time).
20617	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	What nationality are you? You look Native American! You’re gorgeous whatever you are! ( I’m Native American btw 😜)

20621	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	You are sooo pretty, well spoken and have such a nice voice ❤
20622	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I'm a guy (don't ask why i'm here) but do girls dress up and put makeup on to feel good themselves or look good for men? just a question
20623	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I want to go shopping with her😂🛍
20624	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	im soooo jealous of her wardrobe
20625	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Wow I love her
20626	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	GIRRRLL we need your work out routine cause your body IS GOAAALS
20627	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	She had me up until she said we should stop wearing leggings. 🙃 I don’t think leggings always look frumpy. Just make sure they aren’t see through or just wear longer garments to cover your bum. 🤷🏻‍♀️
20628	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	My favorite part of the vid 0:20
20629	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I typically love your videos but I don’t like the connection you make between looking slimmer = sexier. I think that’s harmful and goes against the message you actually want to send.
20630	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I know you may not see this but if you have a chance I was wondering, how tall are you? I’ve always been insecure about my height and I feel as if it always affects my “image”.
20631	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	shrek is sexier than me
20632	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	AlexandrasGirlyTalk please make more videos like this I’m very tomboyish and I wanna become a lot more feminine but it’s hard and it makes me frustrated I don’t know what to look for when it comes to dressing more girly and I just don’t wanna look the way I do anymore I’m not happy and I wanna look sexy without being too revealing like you said in your video and this video helped a lot
20633	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I’m the art of ugly 😂😂😭
20634	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Get out of leggings when you’re in your 20s. No one felt that
20635	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	could you maybe do a vid for girls who live in colder climates? I'm from Alaska but don't always want to wear jackets, cardigans are nice, maybe do a video on different ways to style big sweaters or cardigans?
20636	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Her hair is life
20637	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I have also seen ponte pants, which technically are leggings but are more thick, structured, and look more like regular pants but just feel like stiff-ish leggings. I think they are totally appropriate for professional settings (assuming a relatively normal job that doesn't call for an ultra-formal uniform) and much more comfortable. Many pants that fit me when I'm standing up do not fit me when I'm sitting down. Ponte pants allow me to do both comfortably :)
20638	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Girl you just need to make your own clothing line and you know we all will be lining up 🙋🏽‍♀️😍👍
20639	171	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	It’d be great if you could do these types of videos but also incorporating plus size women
20640	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Maybe you could bring other people into this series? Like different body types? I really love these videos and I think it would be better if there was a range so I can find my body type too- if you want to! Regardless I'll still be watching every video 💓 Edit: omg wig she liked!
20641	173	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I’ve been one of your ghost followers for years, I just wanted to let you know that I love your videos. The amount of work you put into them. I mean you even dressed as the creepy guy 😂
20642	174	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I always look so frumpy in outerwear. Can you make a video about keeping warm during the cold months without losing your shape and getting lost in clothing?
20643	175	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I agree with you and enjoy your pov on most things, but please do not restrict or put any woman in a box with statements like “people should transition out of leggings by the time they are in there 20s” This is so untrue! And for the record, I am 34 and still rock my leggings with class (not see through or ratty looking)!!!
20644	176	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Can't believe I've been subscribe for 3years to this amazing youtuber ...and she got 2.4mklliom subs so proud of her...I just love her vids
20645	177	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Please do a video about diet and loosing weight.
20646	178	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	but i fat thick sis help
20647	179	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	At the end you mentioned adding a fitted, darker accent to the lighter pink color and (the jacket and belt) it looks appealing to the eye, but what if you reversed that? A darker colored piece of clothing and accenting it with a lighter feminine color....will it look just as appealing?
20648	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I’ve been looking for ways to change my look this was so helpful !! Give more tips girl!
20649	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	She should sponsor clothing because she definitely knows how to 😍😍😍
20650	182	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Amazing black slacks... where’d you get these?
20651	183	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I love your videos!! You’re so smart I feel like you could seduce anyone 😂
20652	184	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I dress like a hobo 🙃
20653	185	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Great video. It truly helps to remind me I can get to look and feel feminine and sexy as soon as I recover from giving birth to baby #2. One of my biggest struggles is that I don't really have anywhere to go. I'm a stay at home mom for now. I hardly leave the house so I tend to feel and look frumpy. And on the off chance I do go somewhere, I hardly get time to myself to get ready. The most I have time to do is add a little make up and put my hair in a pony tail if at all. I don't know how other women do it. I always seem to have very little time to get back to taking care of my skin or self care as before the babies. But your videos are inspiring. Thank you 😍
20654	186	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Love you videos but could you please disclose next time that you have affiliate links with some of these items. Transparency is super important!
20655	187	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Do a series and make the next video on the art of sexy HAIR!
20656	188	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Girl you lost me at no leggings HAHAHA! kidding, I know I need to stop wearing them 24/7.
20657	189	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Nice nails are always a great pop of sexy femininity. Nothing too long or drastic but a surprising pastel nail extension or rich jewel polish adds a lot to the look. You always nail that. Pun intended. Additionally, jewelry is a great way to draw attention to certain areas. Necklaces emphasize the bust/cleavage even if the neckline only gives the tiniest peek (in my opinion the perfect sexy tease). Dangling earrings with a simple bun or updo look emphasize the sexiness of the neck and shoulders. Belts give sexy curves. When paired with a monotone outfits, bold jewelry makes the look. Picking up a single feature is really key and that's why sexy/naked outfits really fail because it's such a sensory overload.
20658	190	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	When you said getting rid of leggings when we hit our 20's, I felt attacked since I turned 20 a couple weeks ago and I live in leggings...I find it so hard to shop for myself
20659	191	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	You're like the older sister i always wish i had
20660	192	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I wish her videos were longer.
20661	193	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	It's not appropriate for me to look sexy, since I look like I'm 12 years old. Also, I only wear sweatshirts because I'm insecure af and I don't even want to look like I have boobs lol help me find myself, I'm lost.
20662	194	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	This video was really well put together and the editing is amazing! This is the first time I noticed that she doesn't use background music in her videos, I don't know if this applies to all of them. Her voice is just so calm and soothing that you don't need anything else in the background haha
20663	195	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Where are the fitted slacks from!
20664	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	After having my daughter I’ve just been dressing in leggings, sweats and loose work out shorts. I NEED TO STOP ! 😩😩😩 I’ve started getting way to comfortable.
20665	197	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	I love that your videos are SO informative! You have helped me a lot!! Have a nice day ,love from Greece ❤️
20666	198	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Basicaly wear whatever makes u feel good
20667	199	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	"Where do you get your wax coat denims, and are they vegan? Thank you 💜 I've never been comfortable being called ""sexy"" as I feel that it's such a small and misused/abused word that doesn't at all account for all the allure, contrast and colours of what makes me attractive. I used to be okay with ""cute"" but now that seems too small, too. Adorable, lovely, wonderful, enchanting, alluring, attractive (it literally means drawing people to want to be around you) Are all terms I prefer. Feel free to add onto the list here if any of you ladyfolk, non-binary/gentlefolk feel the same way 🌟"
20668	200	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	LMAO you as a creepy guy with the camera cracked me up
20669	201	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Leggings come in so many different textures & styles now. I love them with oversized sweaters or fitted tops. You can layer a blazer for a more put together look. At least this is what works for me. I am a sporty girl & I live in comfy clothes. For me this style paired with bold brows, minimal makeup & clean nails works the best ✨
20670	202	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	“it needs confidence” then i will never be sexy
20671	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Self care and high self esteem are important tools to boost confidence thus feel sexy.. No matter the choice of clothes
20672	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	How did u get for after u gave birth u look so good
20673	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Where is the wax coated denim from? LOOOVVEE this video by the way <3
20674	206	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	"The ""guy"" at the start made me think of Mariah Carey playing Eminem in ""Obsessed"" 😂"
20675	207	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	She always educates herself on a subject before making a video about it. That mixed with her passion for this overall topic makes all of her videoes so perfect! Every women needs to find this channel!
20676	208	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	You as a guy made me laugh
20677	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	If you've seen Aly Art's Body types videos here on YT, she does things all about what shapes look best on what body types. For example, Marilyn Monroe had lots of softness to her, so she looked great in soft flowy feminine outfits. Totally awesome and worth checking out!
20678	210	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Does anyone know where the light pink dress at 1:30 is from??? It’s so beautiful 😍
20679	211	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Some points to I wanna put out there is to look clean, being hygienic is key no matter what like keeping your nails clean and all the same size and shape with or without nail polish, if you're doing makeup make sure the lines are clean and you're not just slapping it on but taking the time too put the red lipstick on inside the lines of the lips so it does blurry out, smell is important too, take a shower, wash your hair, put deodorant and throw on some nice perfume but make sure its not over powering or its going to give people a headache, if you're going to show lots of skin remember theres a line between being sexy and looking vulgar, know what to do, don't put on too much accessories like too much necklaces or bracelets but balance everything out and confidence is key, strut your stuff , if you believe you're sexy and stand straight like you are then everyone else will believe it too.
20680	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Alex never disappoints omg. My bible as a girl is this channel
20681	213	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Loved! Where are the black wax jeans and black top from??? 😍
20682	214	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Please do a video on undergarments!! Because I really need know what to wear under a white dress because I really don’t want my underwear lines showing through. Send help ASAP!
20683	215	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Girl, yes! I am a mom of a 19 month old and I’m JUST NOW getting myself put back together. I struggled because of thyroid issues, anxiety, and depression. But now that I’m back on track I’ve been buying clothes, makeup, and shoes. I got my nails done for the first time in 2 years. And I’m getting my hair done this week for the first time in over a year. It is making a world of difference. When you look good, you feel good! I’ve been a much better mom and wife as of late now that I’m happier.
20684	216	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	"i loved this video and what you had to say about sexiness being a ""feeling"".. but, I feel like EVERYTHING looks sexy on you. It would be so cool to see other women (in different shapes and sizes) in your videos with you. I know this is your channel and i still will always watch, but i think for videos like this it would just make your point even more!"
20685	217	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	you are literally my big sister😂 you teach me so much ❤️❤️
20686	218	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQagifnBLY	Ooh can you make an underneath video. Every time I go shopping I see cute tops that would show bra straps so Idk what bra to buy for them to not show straps and for clear straps they shine which you can still tell and strapless is not comfortably secure.

Also, I’m plus size and I watch lots of fashion and styling videos, but they aren’t as helpful as yours! I’m losing weight, but I feel like I’m finally starting to feel comfortable in my skin even though I’m still considered “heavy.” Any tips for dressing a bigger body in general? I guess it just comes down to what you want to enhance and what you don’t want to enhance. I don’t know lol

20707	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Hi everyone, I really recommend looking into the Kibbe type system. We all have a very different body type and while most of Alexandra's great tips are helpful to many, some aren't because we have a completely different body type. For example I dont Iook my best in head-to-toe fitted clothes like she does. I'm a natural in the Kibbe system and since I figured that out i'm on my way to a wardrobe that suits me better. :)

20786	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	*expensive girl playing in the background* I’M SORRY, I HAD TO DO THIS
20787	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	"I'm a huge fan of corsets, but let me just say waist trainers and corsets are not the same. A corset should never be elasticated or stretchy. Corsets, by definition, are shapewear that depends on boning to hold the shape, and laces to add tension to the waist (and only to the waist). This is super important - and why elasticated / stretchy fabrics are NOT corsets - they use elastic to squeeze you all over. A lot of corset enthusiast will try to say that steel boned corsets are the only ""real"" corsets or that you need a certain number of bones, but that's not true. However, do be wary of plastic boned corsets - a lot of the time, they're too flimsy to effectively use as shapewear. Corsets can be difficult to wear as underwear / shapewear, as the laces and hardware can be bulky. There are corsets designed with this in mind, but do be aware that not every corset is a good base for your outfits. Corseting regularly is a big deal, and you should think thoroughly about it before you commit. Waist training (corseting with the intention of reducing your waist semi-permanently over time) and tightlacing (corseting with the intention of lacing your waist 6+"" smaller than its natural size) are forms of body modifications. If you're interested in corseting, I highly suggest you think about it as a body modification before committing. Lastly, corsets should be comfortable. I have three that I wear instead of medical braces (I dislocate my ribs regularly). This only works because the only point of tension is on the waist. If a corset compresses your ribs, your hips, or makes your back ache, or leaves you with bruises, it is not a corset for you. I highly recommend buying made-to-measure or fully custom, because, as before, corseting is a body modification. I have bought ""standard"" size corsets that have 4"" of difference between the waist and hips, which is less than the average woman has. How can a corset accentuate your curves when it's less curvy than you are?"
20788	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Damn, I don't know about $300 jeans. Specially when I dont wear them often
20789	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Where do you get a de-piller?!
20790	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	She says she's bought expensive clothes that have lasted her for years? She's 25. What are these clothes? None of them can be older than 10 years, and I really doubt any of them are more than 6 or 7 years old- so where's the proof of their longevity? I'll take this sort of advice fom someone who's got clothes that they're still wearing that are >20 years old- then I'll consider spending $300 on them. But only if the shop will also guarrantee to me that I'll stay the same size for the next 20 years to justify the cost. Empty advice that perpetuates the idea that you have to spend lots of money, or feel guilty if you don't, but keeps the tubers in gravy. Ask your gran.
20791	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	@alexandrasgirlytalk I do not see a link for the corset that you used. Can you tell the brand or where we can find it?
20792	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Shape wear is cheating to me...just wear a smooth thong to avoid panty lines under pants...shape wear and butt push up is just ridiculous and creates a false image
20793	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Can u do a video on monochromatic? I get really nervous when trying to wear clothes of the same color but off on the shades. You look great in what you showed and I really want to learn how to pull it off.
20794	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	"The only thing I don't really like with this video is the tips about shapewear. I do think shapewear is a great thing whenever you need to look fabulous, but I don't think anyone should wear it on a daily basis. Just like make up, and I'll explain why. The body you have without make up and without shapewear is your most natural version of your body. It's your ""normal"" you, in some way. But if on a daily basis you wear a lot of make up and shapewear, this better version of yourself becomes the normal you, and in contrast, your true you becomes ugly. Simply said: make up+ shapewear = ordinary and normal, no make up and no shape wear= uglier than the ordinary. If you don't wear make up often don't use shape wear on a daily basis, then the normal you is the simplest version of you, but the you with make up and shape wear is an extraordinary beauty. Simply said again, no make up-no shapewear = normal, make up+shapewear = bomb. I think it's important to remember that what should be seen by ourselves and by everyone as normal is the version of us without tricks. Because we are naturally born without make up and shapewear, and those extra thing should be kept as an extra that is just there to make you look extra pretty sometimes."

20800	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	I feel like I should of seen this coming but looking skinny or smooth doesnt make you look expensive. Looking skinny doesn't immediately make you look better. Insinuating these things is harmful, you give tips for fashion but one of your tips is literally making yourself look 3 sizes smaller than you are. Ew

20807	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Anyone else think she looks AMAZING in green?
20808	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	I get the idea of cost per wear, but how do I tell I'm investing my money into *quality* clothing as opposed to just paying for a brand name? What sort of things should we be looking for when searching for quality clothing?
20809	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	This is by far one of my favorite videos that you have created till now. I really appreciate your work and passion that you put into your videos. :-)
20810	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	@alexendra I love you and what you make. However, I couldn't agree with the Spanx part. The idea should be to build on the confidence and play safe, when it comes to clothing. Spanx is not that great for the body/skin to be downright honest and young girls can emulate the idea in their lives and hurt themselves in the process, trying to be something they are not. Anyways, that's my pov. Xo
20811	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	The comparison between the top shop jean and the designer is ridiculous. The first clearly don’t fit your body type, while the designer pair does. This is 100% achievable with a lower price point, since a lot of lower price brands nowadays have a lot of different models for different body types. Besides that, there are REAL jeans brands out there, like Levi’s and Lee for example that has hundreds of years in experience in making jeans fit, that KNOWS jeans and fit a lot better than “designer” brands. Which means you can get a super fitting jean for $50-$100. Spending $200-$300 for a pair of jeans is luxury splurging and has NOTHING to do with fit. It’s fine that you do that, it’s a personal choice and each to their own. But don’t make it about fit cause it has nothing to do with it. Regards London Semberg, certified Personal Shopper & Stylist
20812	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Well my problem is I’m young so even if an item lasts 5 years, I’ll only fit it for 1😨 (help)
20813	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	I really want your body!
20814	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	I didn’t know depillars and steamers existed. Are they expensive?
20815	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	This whole time I thought I was being unnecessarily picky when always striving to match my metals LMFAO
20816	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	She sounds like that one beauty vlogger with red hair. Y’all know who I’m talking bout?
20817	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	oh no alexandra.. you're definitely a cold olive type!!! Silver is your color!! Just think about it again... olives are always cold!!!

20820	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Why am I watching this? I'm a 70 year old dried up peach.
20821	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	What do you do if ur on your period and you use a pad? You obviously have to use the not so great type of under wear
20822	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	I have yellow undertones? What color should i wear? My mom says blue looks great on me lol
20823	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	She thinks a $100 pair of jeans is cheap 😂😂😂😩
20824	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	stop buying jeans from top shop and all of those corny ass places! LEVIS are typically between $20-$100 and will last you YEARS.

20827	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Ok, this might sound a bit harsh, but she really didnt look good with that corset... she looked out of proportion and cartoonish... and why should everything make you look skinnier? Those things are hella uncomfortable and its just planting the idea in everyones head again that girls have to look flawless and smooth and have to bend to society’s rules... yes, being overweight is unhealthy, and I am in no way promoting being overweight, but all this looking perfect bullshit is getting real damn old.
20828	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	I NEED SHAPE WEAR ASAP... but how do i talk to mom abt it? 😂
20829	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	I take care of every piece of clothing... I have I have some forever 21 jeans (that I got for like $7 on sale) that are in great shape still, 3 years later... A bunch of tat get tops too, last me years... I agree that generally you pay for for better quality, but I think that you can still make super inexpensive things last.
20830	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Not wearing shapewear or corsets will “diminish my feminine charms”.... geez that sounds archaic 🙄🙄 it’s 2019 folks

20876	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	"I really love your advice! It's very simple and more elaborate than saying ""buy luxury clothing"". I just don't agree with with the waist trainer. They may give you a ""nice"" shape but it's very unhealthy especially in the long run. Please be safe!"
20877	171	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvF-v5LaSSo	Can you please Iet us know which de-piller machine you use? I can never find an effective one.

I feel so insecure about myself Idk where it comes from like so many people do compliment me.. But Idk why I can't stop this feeling that ""I'm not good enough "" I've tried to do so many things from online but I still can't help this feeling... I feel so unloved💔🥺"
20894	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	PLEASE turn these concepts into a series.
20895	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	There's nothing there to distract from what you really are no matter how much or little you wear.
20896	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	The first tip which is dressing modestly and comfortable is really true. I haven't been on more than 2 dates however I noticed that I get really uncomfortable when I wear something sexy or something new that I just bought for the date or the outting. Im going on a date soon and picked an outfit that was comfortable and modest and something that makes me feel good and not worried about how it looks when I walk away from the mirror. That first tip really helped and I feel really confident about this date and if it doesn't go well at least I didn't spend hours getting ready for a bad date. Keep sharing your tips with the world it really helps me. love youuuu
20897	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I dressed modestly when a man asked me out because I was never interested in a man who objectified me and I wanted depth in a relationship. All the women I know trashed me because of it. glad you are talking about this. ✌🏽
20898	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Women ...in particular beautiful women struggle in the dating arena because there are so many men that are simply subpar and not worthy.
20899	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Wanna point out that not a single one of these is noticeable to the guy during the date
20900	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Your therapist is so nice, mine would be like “can you just accept that he doesn’t like you” 🤣🤣🤣
20901	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	After a date I googled the guy I went on a date and found out he was arrested for sexual assault a year ago. So sometimes it's good to stalk them lol
20902	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Little reminder: Turn from your evil ways and Give your life to Christ no Matter what bad things you have done in the past God will still forgive ... God loves you so much that He gave His only son to die for you and your sins. You may Think I'm stupid but Yes He is Real and He will soon come please repent before its to late ❤much love
20903	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	HAHAHA, TALK ABOUT AUTHENTICITY! Hiding behind their MAKEUP FRAUD!!!
20904	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	"I understand that the popular opinion is to say "" a man is not necessary"". I don't know why women have gotten to the place where men were/ are now where ""women are like candy"" comparing people to disposable wipes. Thats not right. God Made us to be social and to have life long companions of equal value, he made man to love his woman, and he made women to honor and to help her man. When the pharisees asked Jesus about divorce, Jesus said that His original plan was for a TILL DEATH DO US PART partner. When I dated, I dated for longevity and not just for a while, I saw the future, and I saw what could be. Dating and having meaningless sex, exposing your body not only to viruses and intertwining your soul with anyone who will satisfy your body is filthy. It doesn't matter if your a boss or whatever, HONOR God in the way you live, and ALSO Honor HIM with your thoughts. Your great at being a role model make sure it matches to the standards of the one who created you."

20912	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Now I realise why she's so perfect, it's the confidence. Confidence can make you seem a thousand times better, and even though she's already beautiful, her confidence makes her seem like she rules the world❤️
20913	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	"""Men are only dessert"" line eh? I'm pretty sure this lady will get the suprise creampie menu option, get preggers and because she views men as just accesories he will feel devalued and leave her. She will be a single mom before 30 and find out fast that most men don't want to date a single mom (they want to start a fresh family with no baby daddy issues). Take her words with a grain of salt guys. Shes only 24, young, wealthy and pretty. Looks fade, money sometimes dries up. You don't want the ""men are just desserts"" way of thinking. Just like you don't want men to treat women like sex objects as their desserts."

20928	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	"From my own experience, it makes no difference whether a girl wears this/that or says this or does that on a date - because the vast majority of men/guys have absolutely no appreciation or even the slightest regard for a girl whatsoever. All they want to do is just pull you into the sack, as quickly as possible and then just discard you. No matter how nice a dress you have on or how good you look in it, they just think it should just end up on their bedroom floor (within the next 5-10 mins.) Their whole attitude towards girls/women is that they are just mere playthings that are just there for their use. Even if they marry you it is just about the cooking, washing and banging out kids - while they go out boozing and cheating, etc. And so the ""romance"" is usually only in the movies or books. But however, there are some real/genuine men out there, somewhere, but they are quite rare - like searching for a needle in a haystack or winning the lottery. Good luck with that."
20929	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	You can tell she really likes herself 😂
20930	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Uhh.. I know you said not to, but I'm saying look people up. Do it. Got a little red flag in my mind (not recent) and I googled a guy. After a lot of effort I found him even though he gave me a slightly different name. Turned out he had a couple name changes, had killed his whole family when he was a pre teen and had been arrested multiple times for aggravated stalking. Not just for safety but if a guy is shallow or full of himself it sometimes stands out in social media.

20933	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I got hurt by so many guys and because I'm someone who gets attached fast and constantly tries to accept their behaviour because I don't wanna lose them. Thank to your videos I've decided to focus on my own health and own well being from now on, thank you so much. A true inspiration 😊
20934	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	does this apply to the gAys?
20935	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	7:00 did this make anyone else cry? I felt like she was talking to me.
20936	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I really want to know what she does for a living! Seems really interesting
20937	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I wish I watched this years ago. I always wore something sexy for dates and you are right, it does attract the wrong things. Love your video and props on throwing it out there to dress comfortable. You always have the best advice.

20941	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Men are just snacks, I'm a man and wouldn't date somebody with that mind set
20942	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	There's a difference between being liked by a man & valued by a man. A lot of guys like you. Not many value you. Be valued by a man

I work for hours to be ""charming"" and ""sexy"".. And most of the times, it's not worth it at all.. But the weirdest part is that they always dare to ask for sexual contact since the first date.. I know that I don't look like a b**** , it's just jeans, top and makeup.. But picked carefully.. I never thought that the care I give, is my biggest mistake. Now, after 22 years, I might be able to go on a real date 😂😂 thank you so much❤❤"

20945	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Honestly, this is so messed up. I never even thouth abou all the stuff you said in this video. It's sad that girls think this way, glad I'm not one of them. But also, hope that girl who need to hear this will see this!!
20946	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Wait doesn’t she have a baby and a husband ?

20948	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Hi sweetie, I am a Deaf subscriber, I wondered if it was possible for you to turn your automated caption option back on please? You do usually have it on, but not for this video for some reason. Much appreciated! 💕
20949	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Wait, i thought she was married and had a child? What am I missing?
20950	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I swear, you definitely should steal James Charles “hey, sisters”, because I feel like spilling tea with older sister when I watch your videos 😍
20951	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Better watch out Alexandra imma eat ur desert 😋 😂😂
20952	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	You should of said straight girls cos I click on this video to help me but the first word I heard was ‘men’
20953	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	you always remind me of Andrea's Choice. You have the same voice and the resemblance is uncanny!

20959	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	She is beautiful, does quality work, the brevity is perfect and she is straight to the point... not a time-waster like some vloggers who delay with stories and subscription demands and end up delivering nothing.
20960	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Wear something modest and comfy on the first date...I LOVE that! I think it's so empowering for us to be able to wear what we really feel comfortable in and expect that the right guy will love it.
20961	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	That tip about eliminating little phrases is helpful for life in general, not just on dates. It shows how unsure you are of yourself. It’s something I need to work on.
20962	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	You know you look like Miss Universe 2019 Catriona Gray from the Philippines right? I mean, you two look a like and you’re both silly and cute but naturally gorgeous❤️i love your videos

20965	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Why is no one talking about how handsome Jack is ?

20971	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Don't really agree with your advice at all. showing less skin won't weed out men who are just going to use you for your body. You're bordering on slut shaming here whether you realize it or not. You're speaking like it's a womans responsibility to dress modestly in order to be respected. Also, maybe for some women showing cleavage is empowering and comfortable for them? You just kinda start flip flopping at the end and contradict yourself when you tell women to dress sexy if you want to anyway, yikes. Stopped watching after that.
20972	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Thank you. Loads of love all the way from Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵
20973	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	me:not dating anyone also me:watching this video . . . . . . . .I love you 💖
20974	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I feel bad for your son. You had fallen into the trap of feminism in the era of social media. I thought you were authentic and smart. I was wrong about you.
20975	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I would REALLY like to see a hair tutorial, her hair is GORGEOUS!! 😍
20976	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Your videos are low quality.
20977	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	You once talked about how you are losing hair in a video, do you have any updates? I think I am in a similar situation! Thank you
20978	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I've been married 15 years. Can't imagine even dating today...with all this texting. I despise texting lol. I mostly agree with your advice.
20979	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	You're giving so many young girls confidence, you should be proud.
20980	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	She's right; that man is a dessert
20981	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	@1:13 what device is she using to shave?
20982	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I made every mistake😰 except stalking someone facebook
20983	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	No woman, you need to be young and at least by 30 be married to a man you adore and share a life selflessly together.
20984	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	“IF THAT EVEN MAKES SENSE” shook you called this out. I didn’t even realize why I would do it. Like girl of course I make sense, I’m smart. Thank you for this!!!
20985	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Thank you so much for this, I really needed it especially since the guy I just recently was talking to cancelled plans on me and the completely disappeared after that.
20986	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	The “but, I don’t know” thing is so true! I mean, I say it all the time around my family when they ask me about things because they just stare at me like I’m coming at them aggressively for just telling them something I like. Like when I wore my clickbait sweatshirt and grandma asked me about it, I told her her it was for a YouTube thing and explained that it’s kinda like wearing a band tee or something and she looked at me like I was nuts until I said “but, I don’t know.” Same with explaining my major to people or my taste in music or whatever. It’s like if I don’t say “but, I don’t know,” they think I’m like forcing my opinions on them or something. Idk. (Ok just did it again 🤦🏻‍♀️)
20987	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	some of the clips didnt really match what you were saying, or were really repetitive. You don't have to have a clip every second, sometimes it could be you sitting on a chair saing whats being narrated and having clips come in and out that make sense
20988	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	*“A man is like a desert. It’s delicious but not necessary”* I love that line.
20989	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Thanks big sister
20990	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Tomorrow I have the first date of my life. This comes at a shocking timing o.O.
20991	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Thank you for making me gain confidence through these past few months, I love you girl xx
20992	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Wait, first things first. How are you gonna get asked on a date? Where to find a date? 😂
20993	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Alexandra: don’t say but, idk Me: ok fair enough Alexandra: idk maybe just me Me: huh? 😂😂
20994	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	*This particular man is definitely a dessert*
20995	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Bless this woman. She is so inspiring and so beautiful, ohmygodd. <3
20996	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Why are you showing your iPhone so much?
20997	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	When I was dating I'd always make sure my dates were straight after work. That way, I keep my weekends for me, but also Id meet my dates in workwear and minimal makeup
20998	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Idk why I’m watching this; I’m happily married.
20999	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	4:59 the other girl's SKIN 😱❤

21001	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I'm sorry if I'm being to personal but I'm a long time subscriber and I remember your old BF and your baby, don't be afraid to do an update everyone here will love and support your no matter we just want to know what happened
21002	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	speak with confidence, STOP SAYING IDK... we all creep ppl, IDK MAYBE THATS JUST ME .. lol hmmmmm
21003	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	*Dam she teaches me more than anything my Mama taught me*
21004	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years and honestly this video STILL helped me. I struggle with confidence and self image, and he helps me through it. Having someone to let you know how amazing you are always helps, especially going through mental health issues.
21005	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I’d love a video on how to speak confidently on dates and how to express yourself but also setting boundaries on certain topics that we talk about. Also would love if you could list some topics that are necessary to talk about on dates and some to just keep the convo going and spice it up a bit lmao. Thank you for the wonderful video though, much love❤️
21006	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Is she single?Where is her husband?❤️
21007	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	you are like a youtube fairy godmother who just comes in and knows what people are struggling with and helps in ways you can't even imagine! QUEEEEN
21008	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Just the word date and dating gives me anxiety
21009	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	You're like the big sister I never had but always needed
21010	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	I don’t know if I’m missing something but....where did her baby go?....I’m truly asking because I’m a little confused
21011	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Im a dude and I watch this. Is that fine?
21012	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	hey you speak with such confidence and grace. Can you maybe make a video about speech for women and how to be more confident with it? Thank you :)
21013	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	You obviously put a TON of effort and thought into everything that you upload. I think your messages and your videos are helpful for everyone at any age, but especially for young women growing up in a world that pushes a specific image and experience.
21014	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Please help me out. I rlly like this guy but I get so nervous when talking to him. How do I acc hold a convo w him and just make him like me back?
21015	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	"I don't really think any of those tips are useful except the ""don't dress too sexy for the first date"". Makeup, spending hours to get ready, talking in a specific way or buying new clothes for a date will not RUIN anything. Do whatever you want to do, especially if it makes you feel happy and comfortable."
21016	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Oh my god I thought I was the only one who does day cancelling rituals on the day of a date

21021	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Do a video like this but talking about the conversations that we might have..How to keep the conversation going and stuff..Love youuuu💗💗
21022	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	You know I’m so proud to have you as someone to look up to. Every single video you release has a fantastic message and I appreciate it truly. It’s weird but just seeing how beautiful, feminine and confident you are somehow makes me feel all that too. Contagious positivity. Please never think your hard work goes unnoticed because your videos are truly what do aid this incredibly depressive state I’m going through right now
21023	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Honestly thought you were married already since your defining so many parts of gorgeous and beautiful. Intelligent. Your someone different from others
21024	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Don't you have a child
21025	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	We like Jack and his jawline😍
21026	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	Can you do a video on what bra to wear with dress and how to hide the tummy area and love handles
21027	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DxagM6JWUk	it's sad that some people believe that more skin = more attractive. thank you for talking about this!!

21037	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Where did you get this bag?
21038	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	"Why vegans consider plastic as ""vegan "" if plastic comes from pretoleum and this is made of animals?"
21039	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	"Lol ""vegan bags"" = plastic bag ""vegan"" just sounds better"
21040	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	I loveeeeeeee this bag! It's absolutely gorgeous. Alexandra, I'm so glad it's yours!
21041	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Ok so the bag might be animal free, vegan but with all that plastic and rubber how much of the environment was damaged, toxic wasted was dumped in our water and pollution in our air to make that bag?? If you think about it I'm sure some animals habitat was destroyed because while making this bag. Maybe something to look into.
21042	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	steve jobs was vegan. he died when he was 40 or 50 i am not sure. he had a cancer. To be vegan is nice but...not your all life. i love animals more than people,lol. but..you must eat it..but not a lot.
21043	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	i love vegan designer bags, you will probably like stella mcartney & zac posens vegan designs too ♡
21044	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Support vegan leather!
21045	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	You are not a vegan, just a vegetarian. Cause vegans are also animalist, besides not eating meet they dont use cosmetics tested on animals like MAC, like you do. Not judging, just saying (:
21046	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Did anyone else see the Cheech bong in the back? haha
21047	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Yeah I agree with you, even though Givenchy has alot of products that have come from cruelty, the fact they are selling one vegan bag is good because if everyone just bought that bag then there would be more need for cruelty free, vegan designer handbags, and the options would increase. :)
21048	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Givenchy has vegan bags?! OMG YES! Now someone tell Chanel, Dior, and Prada to get onboard and I'll be all set!
21049	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Had no idea Givenchy did vegan bags! I still love and would get the leather version (sorry!) but i have to say that looks good for being a rubber type of material. Nice going!
21050	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	As much as I like the concept of an animal product free bag, it's not worth it for a bag that won't last as long as a leather bag would.
21051	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	5'8??? Damn i wish i was that tall😂
21052	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	"After going through some of the comments , it's pretty upsetting that people (but to each their own ) are threatening to unsubscribe from her channel because ""of the whole vegan thing "". I can't seem to grasp why someone making the decision to refuse to use / support companies that test / use animal products could bother someone so much that you'd unsubscribe from their channel . I just really admire what she's doing as it's completely unnecessary to use animals for bags , make up , clothes etc ."
21053	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Vegan is a term for those who don't use anything from animal or a companie who use animal, like Givenchy!!!! Hello, Givenchy never will be vegan darling!!!!
21054	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	what is this tshirt called?
21055	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	I don't mean to offend you or be disrespectful towards your lifestyle, I am just curious if you're keep doing all these vegan things. I miss the old videos and I'm really not interests in your recent videos. I really like you but if you turn into a vegan channel I will unsubscribe (not that this would affect you). I think being vegan is great actually, I am just not interested in these vegan videos. :) (I think I'm not the only one with that opinion)
21056	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Vegan is from Philippines right?
21057	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	You take so long to post new videos to the point I get bored and have to wait almost 2 weeks for a video. Definitely not subscribing.

21065	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	looks cheap what's the point of spending givenchy type money for a piece of rubber
21066	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Not trying to be mean or disrespect you in anyway, I'm just wondering if your still going to be doing DIYs & hacks or if your taking your channel toward a vegan lifestyle channel? I loved the other videos because they were so unique, but I haven't been watching these recent ones because they don't interest me. Like I said, I mean no disrespect to you in any way, just want to know what your plans for your channel are :)﻿
21067	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	I am SO in love with this bag and I'm currently saving every penny for it - it's one of the only vegan designer bags I've come across (aside from Stella Mccartney's line). Loved this unboxing! Enjoy it 😍 X
21068	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	When people who don't skate wear thrasher -_-
21069	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	sorry I don't think this bag is worth 2000$ not jealous by any means, just saying..I like your videos.. and good that you are vegan
21070	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Stella McCartney does vegan bags too! and She's vegetarian! :)
21071	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Nice bag! Where did you get it from and how much was it?
21072	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Can you do the diy corn starch nails?
21073	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	"I might be playing devils advocate but is this just trading one evil for another. Yes you are ""saving the animal,"" but aren't you still harming the earth by buying a bag made of plastic products."
21074	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	LOVE that bag! Omg so gorge! And you look stunning in this vid <3 xoxo
21075	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	I agree with your vegan statement...I also support companies that try to start a difference Like Ben & Jerry's.. 💚✌🌱
21076	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	I have a question about vegan products; I get the whole eating vegan, but I really don't get why someone should buy fake leather; I mean isn't it unhealthy for the environment in the long run, since they use nylon/polyester/ plastic ? please someone explain why we should buy vegan clothing and products? or is it not for environmental purposes? Thank you :) other than that..really nice bag :)
21077	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	this reminds me of Ariana grande (fake vegan)
21078	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	A vegan bag. I didn't know that existed
21079	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	im thinking it might be a good business idea for these brand companies to sell them at lower price so that encouraging more pople including myself to go and purchase a vegan handbag. obviously im not for the leather bag , but these vegan leathers are so expensive.
21080	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Can you do a video talking about how your life as vegan is going and tips to make it easier? I am thinking about going vegan but I dont know if that diet is going to make me gaing weight or if is going to be really hard for me to follow.. Help! Thanks you a lot :)

21087	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	How can a bag be vegan 😂? Is it made out of vegatebles and black foodcoluring??! 😂😂😂
21088	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	how much you paid?..what website?..Thanks for the video :)
21089	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	I love your channel but you want us to kill more trees just to make a rubber bag for you????
21090	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Stella McCartney has solely vegan products as well xx
21091	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Can you please name a few other high end designers who make vegan bags ? I never knew Givenchy makes vegan bags !!!
21092	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	One of my friends suggested this video and I am in love with you! Look into Matt & Nat as well :)
21093	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	I've got vegan DocMartens. And there is no difference to leather. They are just as resistent and awesome. And the best is that no animal had to die .
21094	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Omg thank you!! So glad to see this bc honestly, I don't care about how much you paid or if you used your own money I only hope more and more women can learn about these vegan bags and stop buying real leather. 🙌🏽💗💗
21095	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	What is your nationality btw I love you❤️
21096	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	"One of my favourite sayings is, ""Once you know better, you do better"" kindness to all creatures is a journey I'll never stop loving!! ..Make sure you guys join the #mondayarmy on snapchat to see what cool stuff is coming up BEFORE it hits YouTube <3 username: queenofmondays"
21097	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	How old are you??😊 btw your sooo GORGEOUS love😙
21098	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Freelee are gonna make a video about this
21099	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	When did you go Vegan? Sorry if you have answered this before I am new to your channel! :)
21100	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Omg! Your nails are amazing😍😍 Did you put a video how you make them? 😏😏😏
21101	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Amazing! I feel you, I really hate when people bitch about a brand who also does non-vegan products - it's common sense that if the company sees an increase in interest and sales for their vegan products then they're gonna invest in making more and ditching the animal skin! Xxxxx
21102	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	While the purse may be cruelty free and vegan, the company itself is not vegan or cruelty free, so either way you are still supporting a cruelty based company and funding them. It's hard to get around, like how people buy the cruelty free lipsticks from Mac, but either way, Mac tests on animals and you are funding that industry by purchasing from them. While I understand the idea of supporting them and encouraging them to change vegan, I'm not comfortable with the idea of willingly giving money to companies that are currently slaughtering animals.
21103	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXDghWtdOE	Does she always talk like this? or Was she really excited about the bag? she sounds like she's about to cry. honest question. anyway, Love the bag!!! it's beautiful!! :) ♡♡♡

21109	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	How old is she
21110	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	Whenever celebrities start talking about self care and meditation and what have you, they do it in such an obnoxious way I can't help but roll my eyes at them, but she did it in such a down-to-earth, natural, relaxed way, that I found myself smiling at her. She seems really nice and lovely.
21111	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	Love her energy ❤️ she knows what she wants and needs. Just enough amount of products, so simple and ready to participate
21112	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	😂 I love how she’s making jokes while doing her routine definitely so lively❤️
21113	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	I love her so much. She started the video with indeed makeup off, I respect that so much. She gives very good information and tips, she know what she is doing, so sincere *maybe a little more spf, and wear your eye cream under it*. So lovely. <3 she's awesome. Hair masking? Yes girl! Her hair is always amazing, I don't feel like people treat their hair enough. Spending more money on skincare than makeup? Love it, spreading that idea is lovely. Sharing her perfume, opening up about mental health, learning makeup from youtube, girl that's awesome. Her skincare is just simple but effective and it shows, she have amazing skin. Facials and derms can do a lot but everyday prevention is just where it's at. I just love her. <3
21114	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	okay ashley, I love you but just cause you mentioned that you're a mental health advocate does not mean you have to categorize little things like the eyelash curler to PTSD. It's the use of it, you could just say 'I had trauma in these (eyelash curlers)' not PTSD.
21115	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	*STARTING EARLY IS THR BEST WAY OF GETTING AHEAD TO BUILD WEALTH, AND INVESTING REMAIN A PRIORITY. THE STOCK MARKET HAS PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A DECENT PAYOUTS, WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS AND A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE MARKET WORKS.*
21116	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	I like that she acknowledged that clean beauty is not cheap, that she has struggle with her mental health which taking care of yourself is one aspect of self care, and about having balance. It actually surprised me, and she seems genuine.
21117	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	Reading about people grabbing multi-figures monthly as income in investments even in this crazy days in the market, any pointers on how to make substantial progress in earnings? Would be appreciated.... I'll be in the comments
21118	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	The way she correctly used make up to *ENHANCE* her own beauty and did not just follow those random IG trends.
21119	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	I love that she mentioned the pressure that surrounds switching to natural products. It can get really overwhelming and, like she said, pricey. What an icon.
21120	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	I love her! She looks beautiful even after all those years. She’s one of my favorite Disney stars. Also, I love the fact that’s she’s so real, she never denied her nose job! 💕💕💕
21121	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	I like how she says that having a clean lifestyle is about having a balance and not going to extremes.
21122	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	I love Ashley she’s aging so well 💜💜
21123	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	Love that she still looks like herself- radiant, glowing, REAL skin look!
21124	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	Love her, you guys should listen to her latest album Symptoms, it talks about anxiety and depression!
21125	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	It’s kinda relaxing watching people doing their skin care routine and makeup don’t know why
21126	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	she will always be iconic whether its Sharpay Evens or her as a 'grown up' I also love how she makes a conscious effort to use clean products. It's so cute that she mentions hillary duffs makeup tips I love that their still friends cause they were both part of the same time lol in disney
21127	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	love her so much
21128	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	Gorgeous as always. She will always be my Sharpay Evans, my Candace Flynn, and my Maddie Fitzpatrick 🤩
21129	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	So simple and elegant. Love her
21130	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	The worst nose job in Hollywood history.
21131	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	She’s so sweet and outspoken. She genuinely seems like such a wonderful person! And I love her so much💕
21132	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	SHES AN ICON💝💝
21133	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	Her skincare routine is so refreshing, someone who actually knows what they’re putting on their skin instead of just slapping on a 300$ serum or what not.
21134	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	her look was so simple yet so chique, icon honestly
21135	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	One of the only people I've ever seen NOT age. Legend
21136	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	Her routine was so effortless, quick and easy 😍😍
21137	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	I love Ashley. To this day, I still love her in High School Musical. She's just so talented and beautiful.
21138	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	She has such a pretty voice!
21139	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	She's naturally beautiful

21146	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	she hasn’t aged one bit always has been so beautiful!!!!!
21147	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JnzwrcsbJw	She literally hasn’t aged at all 😩

21162	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	People : she is hated for no reason Me : she is famous for no reason. She is getting more fame without any TALENT (except making cute faces even animals can do that). There are many people with TALENT who don't get the fame they deserve.
21163	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She's being too honest.

21167	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	So it was all makeup after all. This girl is ugly without makeup just like me...
21168	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She is talentless, my gosh I can't stand her. Went on this video by accident. Why the heck is she on here, she's not even a celebrity.
21169	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Not trying to throw any shade her way but she looks like she's 40 without makeup lol.... Unless she is, I don't know? How old is she?

21175	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I mean lets be honest, she deserves what she has today. Her music is incredible and her attitude is so nice.
21176	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She uses a way lighter foundation shade than her skin color.

21179	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	her skin looks very sun damaged
21180	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why her bare face look so dull and red here?was it because lighting bad editing or what?
21181	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Shes honestly chill, wish i could give her a hug to make up for the hate i gave her

21220	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	When she said she was so proud of herself I literally had to square up with my tears.
21221	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She’s rlly not gonna take of the eyelash and pretend she true beauty
21222	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"Some pepole ask: ""why everyone hates Bella"" Maybe because she make a racist figth with country flags burned and incite violence????? BTW using autotune doesn't make you a good singer at all."

21224	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I blocked her tiktoks when I first started but now I am absolutely in love with this woman. She’s so brave, and mature and beautiful. Her background is inspiring and I wish I could hear more about her time growing up and in the military.
21225	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	ah yes the sinapak ng blush look here in the philippines is really a thing and we love it! tbh my go to look too

21232	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She had a very difficult life, she’s talented and deserves her success. I think people don’t like her because she became famous for making stupid tik toks but that’s not her only “talent.” She’s a great singer and performer. Tik tok was only for fun and she gained popularity on there.
21233	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	The fortunate sailboat alternatively wrap because pocket additonally count through a wandering church. sour, jumbled plough
21234	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I really don’t understand why people hate on her. She seems like a chill & down to earth person. Why do people have to bring down others like that?
21235	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	If y’all knew her life story you would have SO MUCH respect for this girl. I’m not a fan of her content but I watched her H3 interview - and she has overcome a lot. She definitely deserves the fame she’s getting.
21236	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	The fact that she's proud of her roots even after everything... deserves so much respect. Proud of you, Bella.
21237	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Has she had a nose job? (No hate just asking)

21242	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Can someone explain to me why she's even popular
21243	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella doesn't deserve any hate, she is so sweet and cute.
21244	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	When she said she watched anime Me: SAME!!!!!!
21245	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"Remember when Koreans hated her for a ""racist"" tattoo? And attacked her Filipina side but not her being American? But forgot that it was Korean soldiers that were recruited by Japanese soldiers during the Japanese occupation in the Philippines in WWII to r-pe young Filipina women in the island of Corregidor for at least 50 times a day. Not to say the amount of help the Philippines gave during the war. Lol at the hypocrisy!"
21246	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	For once, these TikTokers have someone to look up to who isn't an entitled brat
21247	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	This young lady has a grateful heart. She mentioned how grateful she is for her success and even the fact she can afford Gucci lipstick now. So humble and sweet. I wish you all the best Ms. Poarch. I don't even have tiktok but I think you're a real star. I watched the whole H3 podcast interview about your life in the Ph and US and it made me emotional. You are a real life Cinderella! Keep going.
21248	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Oh my god she talk too much

21251	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella does not deserve a spec of hate.. The reason as to why her mother did not give her any skin care tips is because she was too busy verbally abusing her and allowing her husband to physically abuse Bella:( after undergoing such a traumatic childhood she deserves all the success in the world
21252	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I dont get why people hate her like ok m to the b was a bit eh but like build a babe is iconic

21270	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She’s actually pretty cool. I don’t understand how I could hate her. And I feel like some of you are just mad because she got famous quickly, but it’s really not her fault.

21289	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bretman + Bella are two of very few who stay out of drama and is unproblematic. She legit seems chill to hangout with and super down to earth.
21290	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I see no reason to give her hate. I mean she seems like a normal chill kind person who downloaded TikTok and just randomly got famous and now she does music. Yeah she got famous while shaking her head but you guys are the ones who gave her the fame soo
21291	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Her humbleness makes her much more attractive.

21295	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why the fk do people hate on these kind of people like i really dont. Understand
21296	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	4:28 im glad she talked abt this, im not an immigrant but i know filipino immigrants who were bullied in school because they couldnt speak english. its makes me really sad and i hope ppl talk abt this more
21297	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	what makeup can do! People hate on her because she is cute, funny and quiet, she is charming and you just cant help to watch her.
21298	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	People hate what they can’t have.
21299	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	i found out bella poarch has plastic surgery no hate
21300	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	i wonder if bella poarch got fake lashes on or got surgery
21301	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I had no idea she went to the army, she looks too fun to go to the army. Like a person who still goes to the park just because.
21302	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I love how she didn't use beauty filter. She is so beautiful
21303	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	im still confused why she's so famous for? does tiktok videos on what? enlighten me
21304	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"Everyone in the comment section be saying ""why everyone hates her? "" and me finding no hate comments tho 🤣🤣"
21305	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	i seee no BRUSH in makeup nowwww
21306	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	People in comments: stop hating she’s a cool person👍 Me: nobody is hating-😐
21307	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	why do people hate her? she's really sweet
21308	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	There are some people who think Bella just uploaded a video on Tik Tok and she simply became popular, but this girl was not like that. She lived a difficult childhood and was bullied and abused and fell into depression and this video made her a changed and personal girl
21309	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	What she said about not being allowed to use makeup in high school and having a darker upper lip and being bullied for her looks , this is all relatable :(
21310	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	https://youtu.be/odceKM-yL_U
21311	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don’t get why girls like her wear that much makeup. She doesn’t have to, because she’s already very pretty. She just ruins her skin this way.
21312	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella not only u have dark upper lip I have dark upper lip too but it’s ok bc I like the dark one more lol and plz if u have dark upper lips I like them a lot like f**king lot don’t be sad bc u have dark upper lip oh and I am Bengali
21313	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"Wait someone said ""why does everyone hate her?"" People hate her?"
21314	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don't like the fact that when someone gets famous, the people wo are jealous don't let them have any particular interests, like bella made some anime related videos and people are just in her comments hating and saying that she's only doing it for clout, like they just gate keep everything. it's really sad :(
21315	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Kept reading people calling out people hating her, have not seen a single comment hating her. And im here just appreciating her, so chill, so humble, oh well.
21316	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She’s like so calm and chill. She doesn’t even talk much and like she’s more nervous but her auras very comforting .
21317	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Whoever hates her, his heart is full of hatred and envy. She is so amazing why are you criticizing her!!!!
21318	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don't hate her, I hate the society we live in, I hate that Tiktok ,,stars,, make more money by doing nothing than people with jobs

21332	183	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She’s gorgeous, Chill and humble I dont get why people bully her for no exact reason
21333	184	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She got bullied on how she looked before 😕 so that’s why she had surgeries
21334	185	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She's a succesful introverted performer. Never thought it's a possible combination.

21345	196	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella: gets famous Ppl be like : let's hate her and bully her because she's living better life and we're bunch of losers
21346	197	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"Everyone is like ""why is everyone hating her?"" Who is hating her:)?"
21347	198	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	People hate her because she sold her soul and she’s trying to act all innocent and hide it.
21348	199	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	not y'all calling her rising sunflag tatto a racist tatto it's so funny.just to make it clear, it's not a racist tattoo😂she did nothing wrong some koreans just attacked her cause they got angry bcs of it.they're still stuck in the past and thinking the world only revolves on them. many country have been colonized by japan but they're the only ppl who got mad
21349	200	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Yes why everyone hate her tho.???? She just looks attractive and she is brave soul who overcome her dark past....
21350	201	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don't believe for a second she uses any of these products
21351	202	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	What I don’t understand is there are actual celebrities who deserve to speak with or be in vogue and y’all chose a TikTok creator 🙄
21352	203	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	“I’m proud of myself for getting this far” … you went viral on tiktok - haven’t seen her do anything actually of value yet; keen to see her contribute to the world in some way now that she’s got this platform.
21353	204	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I see no hate comments
21354	205	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	i cant find her haters all the comments are nice and respectful?

21358	209	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Jealousy is a weak disease stop hating she's legit so unproblematic and so chillaxed
21359	210	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I have a question, why do girls wear makeup? Other than just being able to cause they can. Why else?
21360	211	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Not a Bella “fan” or anything but that was surprisingly entertaining. Maybe it’s because I’m a guy and always wondered how makeup works
21361	212	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She was good until dropped that cringy song
21362	213	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	You is beatiful

21372	223	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I admire her! I really don't know why people are bullying her because of her race. She's Asian so what? You can be what your race is and so other people. Spread love not immaturity. Take care
21373	224	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Anyone remember when she did not want people to hear her real voice..?

21378	229	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I didnt expect her to have a tattoos cz her face is too cute
21379	230	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She said she wanna make Philippine proud huhu im crying😭❤❤
21380	231	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella looks little ugly in my eyes if she doesn't wear makeup. But I still love her. By the way, Is she American?
21381	232	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Not gonna lie she looks exactly the same before and after she does her makeup which is awesome
21382	233	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"People commenting ""why are you all hating on her"" Me the person who has been searching hate comments for 2 hrs but not finding any be like 👁️👄👁️"
21383	234	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	The reason why other people hate her is because they're jealous of her. Period.
21384	235	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I am Filipino but my family and I do not have dark lips or upper dark lips. I do not think its a Filipino trait.

21389	240	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	As a half pinoy growing up in Norway, I got bullied tons for what I looked like. Thank you Bella for speaking up about this, as it still is a problem all over the world. You are a big inspiration! 🇵🇭
21390	241	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I love how she got famous without any talents 😍 😍 😍

21395	246	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I see more people saying, “why does she get so much hate?” than the hate it self
21396	247	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Wow they are putting tik tokers on here now? The value of Vogue is going down. Seems like anyone can get on here nowadays. Not special anymore
21397	248	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why she covering her darkness?
21398	249	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	these ladies may look good but tthey have man hands! XD

21400	251	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Whattt 😭🖤
21401	252	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	even tho tiktok is cringy it at least allowed some people to get famous without being born in a wealthy family. you can hate on Bella however you want, she's at least a real self-made.
21402	253	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bruh I'm so jealous that she is really natural...😶😭
21403	254	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	This girl is really nice, at least she is proud of she is a Filipino. Not like the other one lily…

21406	257	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Did she say “Growing up in the Phillipines”
21407	258	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	When she had the rising sun tattoo (former flag of Japan) she didn't know the meaning behind it plus she already apologized and koreans and Filipino's are good now and most people that hate bella arent even koreans
21408	259	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why tiktokers on vogue oml
21409	260	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	she so nice and i love her but are we forgetting this VOGUE!!! like we need celebrities, models, etc..
21410	261	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Sold her soul
21411	262	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bully, typhoon, or any hazardous thing in life is nothing in the Philippines..we smile bigger than those, we fight and we strive together...No one or someone left behind....As you can see Bella is so humble and carry all along the Filipino heritage and characteristics of being Filipino..Simple, hospitable and humble..
21412	263	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	military???????
21413	264	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Before I didn’t get the hype around her & now I actually really like her. She is very down to earth & humble. She seems very sweet & just overall real. She also gives me Jhene Aiko vibes lol
21414	265	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I’m asking because I honestly have no idea who she is but who is she? An actress? Singer?
21415	266	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	not a tik joker being on vogue
21416	267	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	He does have a talent of his own, tiktok is only for entertainment not for anything and he is also famous because of you too
21417	268	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She’s so pretty, and I don’t understand how anyone could hate her!
21418	269	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She got bullied for her race (watch the video ffs) and now she gets bullied for being attractive. What a world we live in.
21419	270	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She's such a chill person, I don't get why people hate on her because she bops her head to a song.
21420	271	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bellas nose looks kind of fake. That looks like a nose job nose

21427	278	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I’m not a hater but VOGUE seriously it was literally just ONE SONG 🙄 I swear Vogue will let anyone on you don’t half to be a celebrity anymore
21428	279	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Genuine question. Is she pure Filipina? or half Filipino and half American?

21430	281	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	People commenting why they hate her and still here? Like wtf bruh? Just leave if you don't like her
21431	282	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She’s such a nice person Idk why people hate her like- Bc she is “UwU I’m so cute” but in real life she is really mature . Y’all can’t also get over the fact about the tattoo , at first she didn’t even know it was racist (it was a Japanese sun rising) . She’s a great person not cringe

21441	292	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Vogue is losing all credibility by having so-called influencers with no discernible talent on their channel, cringeworthy!
21442	293	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	My lips are like those. I'm not Philippines tho.

21446	297	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	The makeup looks a bit too light no?
21447	298	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"i didn't know that bobbing ur head to ""m to the b"" and making the most idiotic faces would get you on vogue."
21448	299	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She's so honest and true... We need more people, not just influencers or celebrities like this in the world. 😔😔

21465	316	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	it’s her energy. she’s been through more than the average human being. people would think differently if her whole life was recorded; that’s not overnight success, it’s decades of experience and learning//growing. she’s such an inspiration.
21466	317	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"""why do ppl hate on her"" bc of her imperialist japan tattoo mainly"

21491	342	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	A tiktoker famous for just making gestures.
21492	343	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	the way y'all hate tiktokkers for doing anything outside of tiktok is so weird. Just say that you're jealous of them and you wish you had their life!
21493	344	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I just don't like people beeing famous just because of how they looks ,a lot of other person on tiktok are making really interesting content like art stuff or impressing makeup Bopping head and having million of likes is just to easy and so unfair for other creator who spend so much times to do a tiktok who is not going to be that seen
21494	345	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don't like her and other tiktok kids They are just famous for how they looks and not what they do and that's just stupid
21495	346	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	don't forget she didn't do a proper apology to Koreans. IDK why problematic people always get famous its ridiculous
21496	347	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I love how even though people said her blush looked like a sunburn she still did it because she liked it, when someone told me I looked sick when I wore blush I stopped wearing it
21497	348	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Idk why they call it “signature” then post a tutorial, it’s not signature anymore.
21498	349	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I love that she uses her fingers and not a dozillion of brushes, so cool!
21499	350	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bro did y'all not just see her skin tone with foundation??? Like... Wtf
21500	351	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Even though she did pass high school her bullies carry on with the bullying on social media did you hear her? I mean she sounded so calm and normal like it's a everyday thing she went through a lot and deserve so much love
21501	352	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She’s pretty asf, but tbh she’s more beautiful in TikTok
21502	353	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	How she could be bullied in high school? She is so beautiful, and has a face features that make her look like an anime cartoon. Jealous who, huh? But look at her now. I guess her bullies may be so triggered of how far she came in life, because sometimes fame is something which you don't search for, but cames because compared to other influencers I see, she acts very natural and not like a diva.
21503	354	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	“Never underestimate the power of Faith because when nothing seems possible, Faith makes it possible.” 😊
21504	355	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella : **got famous** People : let’s hate her for no reason
21505	356	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	her skin is not good
21506	357	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	So they really letting everyone do Vogue now💀
21507	358	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don't understand why people make celebrities out of TikTok kids. What talent do they have and what good do they bring? Making silly faces and dancing to the camera like mannequins isn't a talent. There are a lot of REALLY talented people in the world who deserve publicity.
21508	359	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She's prettier without anything on her face 😫💗 Sana ol.
21509	360	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	This is ridiculous.
21510	361	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Такая неинтересная, безэмоциональная и скучная. И, если честно, страшненькая, в тиктоке совсем другая.
21511	362	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Stop, omg. She’s an actual angel. She takes so much pride too for being a filipina ❤️.
21512	363	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Now tik tokers will copy her
21513	364	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	lmao ew no
21514	365	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Vogue is really going downhill
21515	366	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I can’t believe she’s 22 she looks so young , GO GIRL 💋❤️❤️
21516	367	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Do you know that Charlie is making fun of you
21517	368	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I never liked her and I still don't but I will admit: she's got some talent unlike some tiktokers, thank you Bella for not using tiktok as some easy profit gain and actually making use of your skill
21518	369	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	what's the point of hating her, she's a genuine chill and a good girl.
21519	370	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I find her story more inspiring than an untalented stripper turned rapper. Why people hate her? I love her.
21520	371	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	no caus wtf
21521	372	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Everyone got bullied in school no one cares stop playing victim
21522	373	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Q (Question): Why do they hate her so much?! my A (Answer): They hate her because they're jealous of Bella for being pretty and cute.... SHES A QUEEN 👑 WE NEED TO RESPECT HER PERIODT.-
21523	374	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Back here in Philippines we literally used our bare hands to put make up like what Bella did, up to this entire video.. gosh I'm laughing rn' 😌😌 Yep we don't usually put thick make up back here coz it's hot and humid, and it's seems like a concrete thingy sensation happened to our face for like just past min ago or so.
21524	375	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"Hahaha its kinda cute and funny, how mny ""like"" have you said?"
21525	376	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I mean why people hate her? She lliterally had a rough past life but she is there trying to make people smile like I- ..... She deserves her FAME, LOVE, all the good things. Why people don't get that? I mean I have never met a talented tiktoker like her y'all .🥺🥺
21526	377	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Famous for nothing. Not even pretty
21527	378	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	No hate or anything but since when are they making tiktokers act like celebrities they are just known tiktokers not celebs like Beyoncé but she’s pretty
21528	379	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why everyone needs to speak like the Kardashians
21529	380	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	If you hate bella, Trust me i hate you more and we dont need you period😎😎
21530	381	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why are empty people always famous?
21531	382	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	ohhh wait shes a weeb!
21532	383	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	This is literally the first time I’ve heard her voice when shes not singing that caught me off guard.
21533	384	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Is she full Filipino or half only???
21534	385	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	BELLA ANG SIKAT AT ANG YAMAN MO NA PAHINHI NAMAN NANG MAKE UP SET MAG SSTART NAKO MAGYOUTUBE PARA MAKAAHON NA SA BUHAY
21535	386	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Thanks to western genes. She became beautiful. The annoying over proud 🤣 race is on the comments.
21536	387	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She's naturally beautiful and the fact that she managed to speak up about her past during makeup just amazed me.
21537	388	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Yo how can someone be so pretty 😭 she literally looks the same with makeup on
21538	389	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Rule 1: GET PLASTIC SURGERY
21539	390	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She's showing her natural attitude in social media. She is not that perfect girl. She curses just like everyone.
21540	391	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Have you realised the white American tiktokers are so bratty and loud. Bella is different.
21541	392	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	It bugs me as a Youtuber that she is looking at herself (on the monitor) and not the lens! 😑 But she is sooooo pretty and sweet 😍
21542	393	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Other girls skin care: literally takes so long and so many different products Me: moisturizer and done
21543	394	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I have that same lip too. My bottom is always lighter that my top lip. I guess its a asian thing
21544	395	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She so pretty even off Instagram.she seems like a nice young lady.she was in the army so she's not like regular tik tokers
21545	396	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	she sounds very uninteresting but she's pretty and that's what matters
21546	397	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I have no clue who she is, who is she?
21547	398	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She is so boring . She has the personality of a tomato
21548	399	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Tiktok famous lol
21549	400	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	A lot of people deserve to be on vogue that have been trying for years I feel bad bc of tick tock she’s on here but I still feel happy for her i just can’t see how easily she did just bc of that yk
21550	401	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	We do not want tik tokers whyyyyy don't u get it vogue!!!!!!!
21551	402	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	yeah shes nice nd all but how tf do yall enjoy watching her
21552	403	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She has the personality of a toothbrush 😭
21553	404	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Omg why people hate her??? She's so ground to earth
21554	405	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I’m just curious as to why she used James Charles in her video when he’s under investigation for being a child groomer. Teaaaa?
21555	406	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don’t dislike Bella at all, but I feel like the reason people give her so much hate is because she really didn’t do anything to get famous? Like she made lip syncing videos...same reason why a lot of other tik tokers get hate. Unnecessary hate ofc no reason to hate somebody for something small like that but...I also don’t think we should praise her for nothing? And please don’t bring up the fact that she was in the navy🙄
21556	407	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella: sunscreen is important, keep applying it throughout the day Cassandra: THANK THE LORD
21557	408	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella Poarch is calm, down-to-earth, and even stunning. Her talking a lot about the Philippines and just her upbringings in general make her a lot more humble up close. Personally, I don't like her TikTok persona all that much, I feel like her genuine self outside of TikTok shines a lot more. That's just my opinion, though.
21558	409	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I honestly never really liked her because I found her videos weird but she seems like such a nice and genuine person. There is literally no reason to hate her I was just judgemental and jealous
21559	410	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	her skin looks so congested
21560	411	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Even tho u put on ur makeup u still ugly LMFAOOO
21561	412	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	عرب؟
21562	413	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	People bullied her and still bully her for bopping her head 🙂 y'all are dumb asf she is ADORED
21563	414	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella says she's grateful but treats fans like trash. She's great for content but I enjoy the character and illusion rather than the real person and personality of Bella Poarch.
21564	415	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don’t know who she is but she doesn’t even need makeup. She could literally just put on some lashes and lipgloss and call it a day 🤷🏽‍♀️
21565	416	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Lets be honest, she is too overrated
21566	417	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	So we just letting anyone in now vogue?
21567	418	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	People don't hate her, they hate on her. People hate the part of themselves who aren't her and they project it on her.
21568	419	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I do not like Bella Poarch, all tik tokers are crap at dancing in reality did anyone watch the Addison Rae interview with jimmy fallon that gives me second hand embarrassment and so do all the tik tokers currently.
21569	420	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	What is Bella age? She looks like 17 or 18 to me?
21570	421	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She is sooo beautiful but the tattoos😖😣😞😓🤮🤢
21571	422	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	she got asked to do her makeup routine for vogue- y’all should really be asking people like joesphine langford and Billie eilish- not some tiktok person who got famous for moving their head.
21572	423	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I'm so proud of being a Filipina🇵🇭 And yes we are proud not ignorant!
21573	424	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Everyone be like “why people hate her?” But I couldn’t find any hatred here.
21574	425	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	To the people who gonna bash her , she not the only one your gonna bash its the whole Philippines
21575	426	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She is so mature. We need more calm and authentic influencers.
21576	427	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	You are black, like, not white, make up, and things become white, you never white
21577	428	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	ew plsz wkwk

21580	431	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"Bella's favorite word is ""like"" haha she mentioned that many times. She's too cute! 🤍"
21581	432	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I really can relate on wht Bella said that her mom doesn't want her to take skincare Every Filipina mom doesn't want their child to apply some product on their face Also my mom 👁️ 👄👁️
21582	433	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Everyone asking about why People hate her? But I didn't see any hate comments.😅
21583	434	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She's so proud of being a Filipina and I love it.I'm a Filipina too...
21584	435	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don’t get why she gets so much hate?? It’s not like she acted like a brat and said that the food was gross to her chef and cried over losing followers like Charli🙄
21585	436	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She’s sooo naturally beautiful wow
21586	437	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Honestly, can we just appreciate the fact that Filipino celebs are slaying rn? Like Bella, Bretman and even Olivia Rodrigo who is half!
21587	438	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Y'all blind asf she's a fake lol
21588	439	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why do I feel like every person who does this makeup thingy with Vogue share the same bathroom. Like...
21589	440	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I love how she embraces her Filipino culture same as Bretman. 🇵🇭
21590	441	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	ang magbash kay bella mga bahog bilat
21591	442	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She's natural beauty inside outside
21592	443	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I love how humble and sweet she is unlike some other tiktokers.
21593	444	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	“ I wasn’t allowed to wear make up “ strict Asian parents 😆 100% relate .
21594	445	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	to be honest i hated bella so much just because of the faces she makes in her tiktok videos, but after watching this, i ADORE her
21595	446	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	The foundation is so wrong shade
21596	447	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Goodness she’s greasy and ugly

21603	454	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Ahhh she said my name!! 🤩🤩 we also use the same highlighter! Love you Bella! 🇵🇭
21604	455	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I was just wondering if that rising sun tattoo is still offensive or is it okay since its partly covered? Im not Japanese so it was never offending to me personally, I just want to know if its still offending to some
21605	456	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	she’s so proud of her roots and with that she deserves to go far places
21606	457	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Such a boring personality for such a big influencer
21607	458	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	STOP MAKING STUPID PEPOLE FAMOUS
21608	459	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	wow. i use to hate her because her video showed up everywhere, but knowing her personality and all. . .. i really like her and now i feel really bad for hating her without a reason..
21609	460	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Wait... she served the military?
21610	461	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"*""I wanna make everyone proud, especially the Philippines.""* *girl- we are!*"
21611	462	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I am a male and watch a girl's make up tutorial 😂 seems interesting.
21612	463	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She is gorgeous and humble. I love that she’s embraced herself even though she was bullied (those bullies were definitely just jealous of her beauty). She’s very strong ☺️
21613	464	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Di ko pa pinapanood ni-like ko na. Ewan ko ba mare pero very supportive ako sayo.
21614	465	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why is Vogue doing this with anyone???
21615	466	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	i love her but I've never heard her speak...why does she remind me of the way the Kardashians talk😂
21616	467	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"Stop the ""I HATE HER CAUSE SHE HAS AN OFFENSIVE TATTOO"" cause first i don't think she really know the meaning of that flag she just genuinely copy it on her favorite singer, if you say that ""she should have checked the meaning of that tattoo"", i think she didn't consider because it just basically look like a sun why do you want to look for the meaning of the sun hahahaha it's basically self explanatory and secondly if she really knows what is the meaning of that flag i don't think she will get proud to it i mean who wil get proud to the flag that oppressed your own beloved country???"
21617	468	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She seems like a whole different person here than on her Tik Tok
21618	469	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Is Bella poarch adopted?
21619	470	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don’t understand why is she become popular? Because of making stupid face ?? This days people really appreciate stupid videos in tik tok than really talented people??
21620	471	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I'm not a fan of her bobbing head tiktok vids but looking at her more, she seems like a genuinely nice person 🤔 hope she stays unproblematic
21621	472	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I think she's probably one of the fewest tiktokers who actually have a personality.
21622	473	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	"No one is talking about how many time is she using ""like""?"
21623	474	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	5:36 We are proud of you always Bella. Honestly, before I watch the video, I thought you would not talk about being a Filipino, but you make me proud by you being proud as a Filipino yourself! You go Ghorl! vaklang twoeh!
21624	475	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	i don't know why people hate her she genuinely seems like a very great and humble person
21625	476	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	the natural beauty tho
21626	477	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I never really liked Bella because she gave off the vibe that other “quirky” tiktokers do, but she definitely opened my eyes with this and her song build a b was really good.
21627	478	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Bella seems so nice!♥️ I don't know why she gets so much hate. She is also very pretty!💓
21628	479	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	How can she be so pretty?????
21629	480	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	she is naturally beautiful and when she puts makeup it still look natural which i sincerely loveeee and she is so grateful and she is just amazing overall in my thinking, like why do ppl come for her D:
21630	481	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I can't believe she's on Vogue, That was a long journey for her since the day I was scrolling on TikTok and founding her M to the B vid and her followers then was 12k...
21631	482	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why does everyone have such a nice bathroom tho??
21632	483	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	People in the comment saying why people hate her while I'm searching for people who hate her😵
21633	484	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	What military?
21634	485	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Never hated on her cause I don't see the point why. After watching the video actually like her.

21637	488	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	We get it you think she’s chill and humble and doesn’t deserve hate why is there like 10000 comments saying the same thing
21638	489	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She is so pure I hate that people are so miserable that they hate on her.
21639	490	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Be able to embrace your flaws is one thing to be unique and likeable. Everyone is beautiful and dont think you're not coz God created each one of us to be loved.
21640	491	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Hating someone because they are famous and successful for doing their own thing whether it's nothing makes you foolish and immature toxic
21641	492	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I'm Indonesian and my upper lip is also darker. I think that's southeast asian thing :')

21649	500	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Back in the day, they feature you in Vogue when you deserve it and when you worked hard for it. Now... idk, they just feature anyone just for content 😒

21662	513	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why is now everyone saying “she such a nice person, don’t get why they hate tiktokers” when they bring another person, (tiktoker) that a whole different story

21673	524	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I don’t do Tiktok I don’t use Make up But I like Bella. She's so pretty & talented
21674	525	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	If their was an award for best TikToker/ Content Maker it should be her. She is so down to earth and isn't afraid to show her ethnic background. Someone should give her a show or something-
21675	526	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I love how she mention her past about bully and can't afford stuff and how she is grateful now that she became successful and advice us to never give up.
21676	527	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Charli's attitude can't relate to her humbleness 😂
21677	528	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I’m just glad Bella is getting the good treatment she needs and you know. She deserves her fame
21678	529	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Any one else creeper out that she never once looked in the camera? Always in the viewfinder..
21679	530	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	bella is a normal girl. it’s so frustrating hearing theories that she “sold her soul” for her tiktok following. people find any reason to hate. EDIT: I didn't realize this comment would get as much engagement as it did, so let me elaborate on my thoughts. It's the theorists who are claiming that selling her soul is the ONLY possible reason for her quick rise to fame and those who are using this idea as their only basis for their claims that I mean to point out. If you do not fall under this distinction, this post isn't about you. I simply believe that selling her soul isn't the only possibility. Personally, when I first saw Bella on my fyp, i thought she was cute, found out she was Filipino like me, and was looking forward to what else she would post; so i followed. I noticed that she has a huge Filipino audience, and if you know Filipinos, you might also know that we have a lot of pride and support for our countrymen. When Filipinos are represented in the media, it is a very big deal to us because we don't have a lot of it. In no way did I intend to disrespect anyone's religion through this post. I am very sorry to those I hurt or offended in writing this.
21680	531	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	People who are so pressed and “hate her” still keep stalking her and honestly that’s kinda creepy and sick..I guess it comes with the fame..anyway she’s awesome and keep shinning Bella!
21681	532	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	vogue is such a joke now
21682	533	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Sis I'm not even Filipino and I am proud✋🏻😩 you go girl! 🔥
21683	534	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	shes sounds so ackward in this video...
21684	535	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	This has nothing to do with bella but in every one of these vogue videos yall rave about how down to earth and chill someone is 💀 im pretty sure no one is gonna talk like a psychopath or sumn if thats what you think. It’s just them doing skincare in front of a sink. I don’t think you can go wrong with that...
21685	536	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I love how America makes people famous just by making so stupid dances or faces lol and now they're rich and in vogue
21686	537	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I feel baaaaaad I said she wasn’t a celebrity and got mad when people like showed her respect? What’s wrong with me lmao Now I realize there’s so much more to this person she’s so nice Edit: WOWIE ZOWIE PEOPLE tysm for all the likes and comments and such I am glad that I have realized her story and what a nice person she is And I have gotten more than 3k on a comment before but IN ONE DAY? You guys are awesome thank you
21687	538	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	They just put anyone on vogue these days , she’s literally famous for nothing
21688	539	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I can think of million other people who deserve to be on Vogue than this girl. Vogue, you lost your classiness.
21689	540	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	She thinks she all famous now 😂😂😂
21690	541	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Why do people hate her. She's nice, has a soft voice, a good personality, and worked in the navy. I would like someone if that was their personality.
21691	542	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	2:10 — “when i did the *empty the baby* video...”
21692	543	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	Does anyone know what did she mean when she talked about being in the military? Is it common for women in the Philippines to go to the military? I have no idea and I am just curious 😅
21693	544	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	If you want to get famous and have huge fan following without any talent then heres a tip 1 be pretty 2 be kind Yeah thats it.
21694	545	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	The foundation and concealer shades she used were comically too light for her complexion. She was like a different race by the end of the video, LOL! Also, non-13 year old here so I don't know who she is, but this girl has ZERO personality, which tbh is completely on par with every other tik tok famous person out there.
21695	546	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	No more talentless tiktokers PLEASE. I thought Vogue had standars.
21696	547	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	what has she done to deserve a vogue video? someone lmk
21697	548	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	I used to be a fan but after watching this i became a whole air conditioner
21698	549	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUUFpRYtN4	This girl was in military? 👁️👄👁️... Someone pls explain... 😶
21699	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	I hope she invests In eye creams
21700	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	Im in 2019, and i literally spilt my coffee at how she just smudged the and formed the eyeshadow
21701	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	Cool as heck - I’m trying it!
21702	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	She will look 60 the day she turns 40. Easy tutorial on how to get wrinkles.
21703	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	Wasn't she vegan? she is using MAC... I don't understand
21704	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	Give it a few years... The way she handles her eyes are gunna catch up to her
21705	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	She looks like Jack White, and that's a compliment
21706	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	And how is that pretty...?
21707	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	I love Soko, been a fan of hers for about 10 years and its been so cool to see her grow, progress and become so successful in her career. Also this woman does not age, she looks the very same as she did 10 years ago, not a line on her face.
21708	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	that smile at the end im super gay
21709	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	ahhh i wish i could pull this off. i love red eye makeup but im really into the natural stuff, and i think it would look weird on me and not even near as badass as how it looks on her
21710	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	Gotta love the people hating on her because she's (basically) thinking outside the box♥ Makeup rules do not exist; they're not carved into stone. Just like fashion, it always changes! Beauty gurus, friends, family & what not will always try to tell you what you can and cannot do with your personal style, but at the end of the day, it's all subject to their own personal opinion of how they want you to look. How you want to look is subjective to only yourself... in other words, it's a personal decision you make for yourself, not for other's approval♥ If other people don't like it, then so be it! There will always be someone that does not like something about you, and that's fine♥ :D Want to look like Soko? Or like a Kardashian? Or like X/Y/Z? Go for it! Because hey, when you're happy and comfortable with your own skin, and that's all that matters♥! Love her creativity, her music, and her free spirit♥ ^^
21711	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	she tries too hard
21712	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	Her foundation skills is my goals😂

21714	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	I need more of these kinda makeup tutorials!Everyone in youtube seems to be so solemn about how perfect makeup should be applied on your face but this is how I like to get it done and over with! Good job there!
21715	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	A video of how a girl did her makeup bad
21716	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	i'm french and when she speaks french she is terribly annoying lol
21717	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	Gosh Vogue I thought you were all about skincare and wrinkle-prevention
21718	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	what the actual fuck
21719	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	I like the look but I think doing this might give you eye wrinkles & droopy eyelids lol
21720	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	i love her but gerard way is that you?
21721	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtF-UWOwges	amazing how good this actually looked....

21727	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	The most attractive thing in her style is that she looks very normal yet elegant !
21728	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She has terrible taste? It’s very basic. And if she’s ever out and she has a good outfit... it’s Maeve who’s responsible. Not hailey lol
21729	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	i love that she rewears her clothes. we don't see that a lot with celebrities these days.
21730	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	The comment section is so positive and I love it:)

21739	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I LOVE her signature bun. It's what makes her Hailey
21740	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I don't know why, but her attitude and her voice gives me peace. She's so sweet 🙂 Edit: Thanks for the likes
21741	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She’s so fucken racist. I’m black and I’m genuinely disgusted.
21742	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She always dresses so simple but still so frickin stylish like omg how
21743	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She's not pretty that's just my opinion
21744	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I don't care
21745	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She is the only girl I know that can pull off SWEATS
21746	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	"Almost died, ""we have a no shoes policy in our house...my husband doesn't like it."" Uh, it's called being married to a Canadian. lol We cannot be the only country that finds it odd wearing shoes indoors?"
21747	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She seemed a silent girl with a good heart. Love the fact that there are more positive vibes in the comment section than nega. Good to go!
21748	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	How does someone her age afford such threads??
21749	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	i love that she has a very natural figure, shes not really exaggerated in any physical aspects like what most of the female celebrities seem to be doing now. She looks and feels like a normal woman
21750	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Why the BIEBER bag front & centre 🤣🤣...never saw her to that with a Baldwin one!!
21751	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	No hate here!! I’m genuinely curious!! What is she famous for? Like what does she do for a living?
21752	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Justin Bieber is so lucky to have her in my opinion. She is very sweet and calm and put up with a lot of his stuff.
21753	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	❤
21754	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She is so super tall
21755	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	WHO ARE YOU ????
21756	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She is bully.
21757	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	"Hailey: ""it got that yummy fleece on the inside.. Justin: ""you got that yummy.. yummy.."
21758	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Who cares about what she is wearing...
21759	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I recently read that these idiots at Vogue called this woman a supermodel. Sorry, that appellation actually does mean something, not that you're a nobody who married a man who has talent. Those models worked hard and are intelligent people, not to be defamed by Vogue. No wonder they can't sell a magazine any more.

21761	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She seems like such a sweet girl . I really hope Justin has actually changed and treats her properly behind closed doors , cause she seems like the type of girl who would put up with a lot and just brush it off .
21762	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	none of that looks good. what is wrong with ppl to just adopt whatever ppl say is 'in style' when it really looks like crap? lol

21777	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She has *plastic surgery* ... look at her before photos before you watch this and start picking yourself apart.
21778	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Hello Hailey <3 I voted too! Trump2020!
21779	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	what does it profit to gain the whole world and loose your own soul,Idolatry in clothes.
21780	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	"Y is she like ""my husband do this, my husband wants that"". Just say his name for christ sake."
21781	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I think we all know she is a Beiber now it’s annoying how she ALWAYS has something so people see Like the Bieber purse.
21782	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She's so pretty omg
21783	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	so its basically just blazers huh !!!!!!!!!!!
21784	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	"Hailey is so good and I don't understand what she sees in JB. He is mean and rude and in spite of that he receives fame, money and precious Hailey. This is the first case I've experienced where ""good people get good thing"" goes wrong. Hope she stays healthy and happy."
21785	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Everyone is always like Hailey is lucky to be with Justin but Justin is the lucky one.
21786	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She look like a man
21787	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	0:48 she can pull that but gurl if i wear dat- im gonna look like im running out of clothes
21788	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Her style is every other Instagram girl lol it’s so boring.
21789	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Her voice is so calming and shes so sweet c:
21790	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I wouldn't marry her.
21791	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Don’t care what anyone says, a ‘bralette’ is not an appropriate top to wear out in public
21792	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	she is the only model who loves super over size, it is a good thing
21793	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	The fact that I was a hardcore jelena shipper but then I immediately fell in love with her, she is such a wholesome human being 💖
21794	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	the queen of street style
21795	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I have a weird feeling shes pregnant.... not cus her body looks bigger it dosent but her body language and idk just a weird vibe im getting. and usually im right with that.
21796	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Why do people wear bras as a top. It looks trashy as.
21797	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I think she needs to start a YouTube channel. I love her voice and vibe she’s just such a beautiful soul.
21798	75	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	4:52 i want to know what bag is that...it caught my attention
21799	76	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Wonder if she shares her dad’s voting style!! Go Trump!!
21800	77	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Does anyone else think her Friday outfit looks kind of like that picture of The Rock in a turtleneck?
21801	78	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	"She looks very ""aimable"". I don't know the english word for that. But , I may understand why Justin wifed her !"
21802	79	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	The way she just took off her sneakers reminds me of myself 😂
21803	80	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	8:09 No shoes. It's a Japanese thing. I love that.
21804	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She's so B A S I C H O W ?
21805	82	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Hailey is beautiful and sweet. Who makes the sweatsuit she is wearing? Someone linked the memphis wolford bodysuit but that is not what Hailey is wearing in the video.
21806	83	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Next, every outfit Lisa Blackpink wears in a week
21807	84	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Can anyone tell me a good description of Hailey's hair colour in this? It'd be much appreciated!!
21808	85	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	The sunday pink is straight up pajamas. I would feel uncomfortable if my dinner host was wearing that. Celebrities are weird
21809	86	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She doesn't even try to be beautiful. She looks gorgeous even in simple outfits
21810	87	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Unpopular opinion: i have always loved hailey and still do. The hate she gets is unnecessary and disrespectful.
21811	88	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I didnt like any of these clothes really (the black dress was ok tho), but when youre skinny anything can look good. The clothes really dont matter. #skinnypeopleproblems
21812	89	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Hailey: “I feel very like business chic in this outfit...” Me: 👀 you’re wearing a bra under a blazer...
21813	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	"people who think she looks kind or natural beauty,you better dig deep before you say that...duhhhh everyone looks kind on camera😆 she is only getting the attention because she is married to ""the Bieber"""
21814	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Very weird style...
21815	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	It's insane how many times I've watched this
21816	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Makes sense Justin doesn’t like shoes in the house. We Canadians are all taught that. Literally makes me cringe seeing people wear shoes in the house especially on CARPET.
21817	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Maybe she should start wearing a mask!!!
21818	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I really don't understand why she gets all the hate, she has always been so kind and well-spoken. And these accusations about having plastic surgeries are ridiculous. Nothing wrong with plastic surgery but you can clearly see she is a natural beauty.
21819	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She’s pregnant?
21820	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I am Sagittarius and I feel like we are the best in style
21821	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Not just Hailey, but I've realised celebrities have been dressing like they're homeless last couple of years, find it kinda weird ...
21822	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I.like selenagomez style more than anyone though she is not a model but has a nice dressing sense not like hailey
21823	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	"uhm I think her style is horrible... american ""nothing"" called style, jesus"
21824	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	all those jackets are so baggy
21825	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Hailey seems like she is actually sincerely genuine and kind to people and not just for show like other celebrities!!
21826	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	she seems kinda insecure even tho she is such a bomb inside & out
21827	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	What does she actually do? Like, what is her profession?
21828	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Only Haily can dress like a hobo and make it look like it’s high fashion.
21829	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	🤮
21830	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Her style is amazing she's all over my pintrestboard
21831	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	PLS DO WITH JENNIE BLACKPINK!
21832	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I love how positive this comment section is ❤️❤️
21833	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Most Canadians DO NOT wear shoes in our/your house. You'd be looked at like a weirdo if you walked around your house wearing anything other than socks or slippers. 🤣
21834	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	That was so cute when she said “Please excuse me” 😂🥰
21835	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	"when she said ""cute little black dress"" my directioner self couldn't help but burst into song lol"
21836	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	LOLOL when she struggled to bend and stretch w the vinyl pants!!! Ahh that was so funny and realistic lol love hailey
21837	114	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	"Whenever she says husband i stop and think like "" She is talking about Justin Bieber."" Cant still believe my childhood kid singer just got bigger and bigger and got married to an amazing woman. Sometimes the progress that he has done makes it impossible for me to believe he is the one who sang ""Baby and One Less Lonely Girl."" Time goes by so fast."
21838	115	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I like that she picked clothes she ACTUALLY wears a lot and paired them well
21839	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Justin Bieber's set such a good rule: No shoes in the house :)
21840	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Those baggy jeans 🤮
21841	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I only watched the Monday and it is the most horrible combination ever. Is this a real outfit??
21842	119	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	she can pull annnnything off. god bless
21843	120	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She’s so perfect like she could wear a potato bag and still look stunning
21844	121	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	she seems so nice. I would love her to create a youtube chanel or sum
21845	122	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She should be friends with Hillary Duff because idk how but they kinda have the same vibe
21846	123	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She is literally the queen of street style! Every single look she nails. She is so minimalistic in the way she dresses but manages to pull it off after adding her little twist. So sleek and elegant but so chic too. Best video that vogue could have uploaded.
21847	124	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Your husband? Oh Selena Gomes ex , ? Lol
21848	125	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	she’s cute why do people hate her??? 🤍
21849	126	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	This is the best comment section i have ever found about her and she deserve it since forever !
21850	127	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I remember following Hailey before she was married to Justin and this girl is so sweet and down to Earth! I'm tired of the hate she gets just bc she's married to Justin.
21851	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	In true Canadian form, Justin doesn’t like shoes in the house.
21852	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I felt it when she said sometimes I feel girly or tomboyish
21853	130	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Hailey: 7 days, 7 looks. Me: wears the same outfit the whole week
21854	131	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Can we take a moment for how cool her outfits are like there so minimalist and sheek if I saw her walking down the street I would simply turn around she beholds so much power in her fits!
21855	132	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She's so gorgeous & these outfits are awful. Crazy how someone in the fashion industry is so unusually dressed. Seems She's trying to hide or something.
21856	133	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	well i did some calculating, yes i spent time on this. but all that she was wearing came out to a total of $24,817. with only a few items and i don’t think everything in my room even cost that much and i can’t even get my parents to buy me a $700 phone yet she is casually wearing $5000 blazers. good for her though, she earned it.
21857	134	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She sounds so polite and innocent and is just stunning with her style. Beiber is lucky man
21858	135	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I’m not hating but I like the sound of Hailey Baldwin instead of Hailey Bieber. Hailey Bieber just sounds off 😕
21859	136	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I don't understand when people criticize her, she is an angel
21860	137	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Omg i love that girl dont understand the hate
21861	138	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Something i noticed about Hailey's pap pics is that she re-wears outfits and accessories. I have the white jacquemus bag and while looking into it, i found several photos of her using it.
21862	139	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She doesn't even try to be beautiful. She looks gorgeous even in simple outfits
21863	140	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I like selena
21864	141	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Every Day Justin beiber outfit be like:- DREW:-SHIRT DREW:-PANT DREW:-SOCKS DREW:-CAP DREW,DREW,DREW CALVIN:-INNERWEAR
21865	142	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I want to dislike her because she stole my husband but ITS SO HARD. She's so likeable. Darn you Hailey Bieber 😤
21866	143	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Why dosen't she use her last name instead ! Like even tho married still dads r more important
21867	144	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I don’t know her personally but I’m sad that she received so much hate since she get with Justin. She is very beautiful, doesent matter if she’s natural or not. If you keep pleasing only girls with no works done, we will always be stuck in a society where beauty is a birth gift and something that matter too much. Shes amazing and not less valuable than people who never have had works done
21868	145	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Selena fans quit hating on her,its seriously not cool at this point.
21869	146	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	This is like $50,000+ worth of outfits in a room lol
21870	147	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	The girl Who dont keep her Maiden name.
21871	148	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She can literally wear anything. Even the basic sweatpants she is still gorgeus.
21872	149	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She have personality/style , she’s unproblematic and cute .. why would anyone hate her ?
21873	150	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	when the world is in a pandemic vogue gives us shallow content of a rich blonde heiress.
21874	151	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She looks that kind of person whos always optimist and never let it to go to depression or anxiety She seems to smart and knows how to deal her life
21875	152	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	If she weren’t racist, I’d kind of like her....
21876	153	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	in love with her style <3
21877	154	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Honestly, Hailey is the most beautiful woman in the world, the only ones who disagree with that are the fans of Selena Gomez 😂
21878	155	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She's such a flop 😂
21879	156	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	It’s crazy that a bra is considered “business chic” in the celebrity world maybe, but in reality the hottest model looking girl isn’t going into an Amazon office meeting wearing a bra. HR would have a field day. Hailey Bieber should have won worlds most beautiful woman. I know Bella Hadid is considered to be, but Hailey is so pretty plus she seems very nice and polite.
21880	157	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	she always using the name of justin for attention
21881	158	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Ugly
21882	159	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She so boring
21883	160	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	No one cares about Justin bieber wife
21884	161	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She is literally the queen of street style! Every single look she nails. She is so minimalistic in the way she dresses but manages to pull it off after adding her little twist. So sleek and elegant but so chic too. Best video that Vogue could have uploaded.
21885	162	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	she called him husband 🥺 i don’t get why she gets so much hate
21886	163	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I wish her personality would be as great as her clothing style
21887	164	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Why don’t Americans see anything wrong with wearing shoes in the house?! Lmao
21888	165	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	I don’t know why people hate Her. She is a wonderful person who loves good and loves to help ....
21889	166	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	What are those shiny pants called? The one she wore in her second look?
21890	167	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Call me delusional, but I have a strong feeling she’s pregnant.
21891	168	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	7 days, 7 looks.. so she looks stunning everyday and every night
21892	169	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	idk why but I feel safe when she talks. She seems like the sweetest person ever.
21893	170	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	At this point she should start a fashion line.. Her style is amazing❤️. I'm happy for everyone. I'm happy for Hailey, I'm happy for Justin, I'm happy for both of them and their exes. Growth and happiness looks good all of them. Justin looks healthier with Hailey and Selena looks healthier without Justin. Good for all of them😊❤️
21894	171	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She is just gorgeous and polite in the way she speaks. Brings calm and joy every time she smiles. Hope I'll find a genuine person like she is , Justin you have been so lucky to find her and your inner change just underline it.
21895	172	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	All the girls being jealous of hailey for marrying Justin and I’m just like UGH can I marry HER??? Her closet and style is INSANE!!! I don’t think I‘ve ever disliked an outfit of hers. She is the queen of street style for me!!

21902	179	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	Her style is cute but there is something shady about her.
21903	180	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	could you please do more fashion videos with her about her own style
21904	181	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVHi96NZls	She could wear two different shoes and make it a trend

21949	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkWdhln7SGc	For all of you making a big deal about her voice: she probably had a laryngectomy or a tracheostomy and she's speaking through a speaking device! You can see she's wearing something high neck to probably hide the device.

22032	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Prolonged tension and pulling on the hair can actually cause irreversible hair loss. You can find countless articles on this online. So I would recommend just straightening your hair with an iron, even though it harms your hair, the damage is not permanent. And if you're worried about your hair looking like charcoal then buy hair heat protectants, or if your hair is already burnt then there are products that say they treat just that thing. Though I'm not sure how efficient they actually are and I'm done with my research for the day. Just trying to help people before they end up looking like Mr.Clean LOLS. PS. how did i end up here... like I'm a male 15 year old and was looking at calisthenics training videos and then I found myself here?!?!?! Also i have a final tomorrow!?!?! what am i doing!?!? AND no, I don't straighten my hair because my hair is already as straight as it gets.

22039	81	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Im definitely going to try this tonight! I'll post updates today and tomorrow and once I'm finished. Edit 1: About to wash my hair and start the process :) Edit 2: Finished combing through my hair/putting it in the ponytail, more updates coming after the hour is done. Edit 3: The hour is over, so now I'm starting to put the bobby pins in place. Edit 4: I put all the bobby pins in and look stupid. Doubting this tutorial now... (next update will be in the morning) Edit 5: It didn't work. My hair just turned out curly like it was before. This was a very good idea, and I might try it again soon! :) Okay so it is about 2 months later (1/17/19) and im willing to try again. - i have already washed and combed my hair and i am now waiting for the hour to finish.

22048	90	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Hi guys I have 3b/3c hair and I’m going to try this method this week.. Definitely going to tweak the method and add products, I will come back and update!
22049	91	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Am I the only guy here? You know, being a metalhead my long hair needs care😂😂😂 My hair is not curly but it's wavy and frizzy... and I like it super straight... but I don't have really thick hair and so I decided to stop using irons and blowdryers... so yeah I'll try this one!
22050	92	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	"Im Puertorrican and i've been doing this for years. We call it a ""dubi"" but the process Its much easier. We just put the bobby pins and thats it and leave it overnight"
22051	93	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	It hurts to have curly hair 😳 I want to see how I would look like with straight hair
22052	94	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Is this permanent hair straightening ?????
22053	95	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I have such a long hair like soooo long so this is impossible for me but my hair is fizzy and I hate it
22054	96	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	No hate, but this is probably just as damaging as using heat. It’s not good to pull your hair up really tight and sleep in it for like 8 hours. You can loose a lot of hair and it’s just not good in general. You might as well just use heat. If this works for you though, I definitely suggest you use it🙂
22055	97	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	To be honest doing this method in such small sections really does a number on your scalp. When I tried this technique it gave my head small bruises, I prefer to wrap my head in bigger sections, not small ones.
22056	98	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I had curly and puffy hair and the first time it came out puffy not straight but a little less curlier and I started doing this for many weeks and months and now my hair is naturally straight🙌🏼you guys should try it, it works it just takes time
22057	99	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I have hair just like hermione granger
22058	100	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	it really works thank you so much
22059	101	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	*you are a lifesaver!!*
22060	102	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I hate curly hair because I am having it so bad
22061	103	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	You sleep with makeup on?!!???
22062	104	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I tried it and it worked! THANK YOU THAAANNNKK YOOOUUU SOOO MUCH THAT WILL SAVE ME (and my hair) IN COLLEGE♥️
22063	105	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	It’s a unhealthy method
22064	106	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Is it permanent?
22065	107	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Won't this make the roots weak because of all the pulling and bobbypins?
22066	108	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	you can just straighten your hair with a fan, Its cold air, no heat, and works faster and better than a hair dryer
22067	109	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Does it last for 5-6 days?
22068	110	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	It can do lots of damage. If your hair is weak the pulling can make it come out or something. Also not good results for curly thick hair. I reccommend just taking your ole straightener and straightening it.
22069	111	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I just comb my almost dry hair over my head while bending upside down into a ponytail at about “unicorn angle.” I do NOT use a ponytail band or rubber band or bobby pins. Then I gently twist the ponytail from the middle to the ends. Then I take a rolled up washcloth and use it like it’s a roller. Roll from ends to scalp and secure with a claw clip, with front of claw over roll from behind and back of claw into hair on back of scalp. Wait 2 hours or until dry. Unroll and gently brush hair out, but leave scalp hair alone if you want some lift.
22070	112	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Guys and gals who are reading this and tried it, is it temporary?? Please reply ASAP cuz i'm gonna try this
22071	113	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	will this work if i washed my hair the night before?

22074	116	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Don't say I love you. But your videos is best video
22075	117	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Does not look straight to me and all that stress that you put your hair through for that? Curly hair should never be brushed when wet! All that breakage, I am sure that if you just simply straightened it with straighteners the damage would be about the same ... good effort though, it's just that people should get the right message about how much damage this method causes!
22076	118	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Does this even work???

22086	128	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I've tried this like 3 times now and I just cannot seem to get it to work. My hair is about your texture (curly that comes with frizz) but my thickness has gone away. (I've lost some hair over the years). But yeah, when I take everything out in the morning it's all crimped, I think from the bobby pins. (When I wake up my scarf has loosened up and fallen off even when I double knot it. ) Maybe that has something to do with it?
22087	129	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Ok so she got out of the shower with her makeup not ruibed???

I only use a wide tooth comb when I use conditioner after I've washed it. Even then it's still goes very frizzy after half n hour while it starts to dry (underneath it takes hours to dry) I wish I knew someone who has hair like mine to help me :(

It can be quite uncomfortable the first couple of times you try it but you get used to it plus it's totally worth the result and no damage!
22186	228	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	my hair is straight after it dries but if i let it out too long without tying or not touching it, it will suddenly look like a candy cotton.😐
22187	229	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I'm trying it right now and I have the exact same hair as Alexandra, so yeah I hope this works
22188	230	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	This isn't damage free. Putting your hair in a ponytail when wet causes damage. It stretches the hair out and causes breakage.

22201	243	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	You shouldn't brush your hair when it's wet. You can untangle your hair in the shower with your fingers and conditioners.
22202	244	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Hmm sorry to say this is not good for your hair. When the hair is wet it's extremely weak and fragile, so brushing it and putting it in a really tight pony tail will cause breakage. So yes this may look gentler than a straightener but I wouldn't say so... If your hair is damaged from heat just don't do anything to it and put it in a braid (not too tight), moisturize it with essential oils, maybe get a professional treatment to restore it and just give it a big break. Please just don't be that harsh to your hair.

22226	268	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	My mom told me to stop straightening my hair (I have really curly hair) because it's drying it out, making it stay straight, ect. But does this method ruin ur hair as well your basically pulling your hair straight and I don't want my mom to get mad at me if it hurts it.
22227	269	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	+Alexandrasgirlytalk could you say about how many minutes did you wait to put a bun when you were drying your roots ?

22243	285	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I learned this from a woman years ago who did it to her hair all the time and said that she thought it would work for me too. Generally it worked, but the problem I had was that my hair crimps very obviously where the bobby pins were put in. I tried so many things to avoid it, but it was a no go for me. And then of course it curled back up within an hour. I hope it works for other people! :) Funny enough the only thing that will straighten my hair for any long length of time is if I try to curl it with a curling iron...straight irons only work for like five minutes and then my hair has curled back up. It's ironic and frustrating!
22244	286	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	the problem is i have short hair so i can't put it in ponytail

22267	309	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Ok so this might not hurt the hair (meaning the actual strands) but doesn't it hurt the roots?
22268	310	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I hate this
22269	311	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	i’m surprised .. i can’t belive that you do this , i thought it just people from my country do this ..we always do this for our hair instead of using heat ..
22270	312	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	This is a saran wrap method without the saran never thought to use this on damp hair though it makes a lot of sense. My hair is super curly Ahfro Baang curly and my ponytails leave me with straight roots either wet or dry. This is a smart idea especially if you're a heatless curly. I'll experiment, thanks for sharing
22271	313	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I'm a guy and no, I'm not gay and no, I don't have long hair, and no, I didn't listen a word of what she said (apologizes to @AlexandrasGirlyTalk ), but I just watched this because she is really stunning!

22275	317	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Won't you catch a cold if you sleep with wet hair? Or does it dry out enough before you sleep? Btw, what an awesome tip! I have never seen this before, so thanks for sharing!
22276	318	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I am so surprised with how well this worked! I also have naturally curly hair and I was so tired of seeing no-heat tutorials that are meant for people with straight hair... I felt like nothing catered to my hair type! With this, the idea is genius! I too have tried experimenting with different straightening methods but never found anything life changing or worth the extra effort. I can't wait to try this tonight! Thanks!
22277	319	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Thanks for the video! Can't wait to try it... Hope it works!

22295	337	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	I've always done this method to go to sleep after i straighten my hair. Never knew you could do it with wet hair also!

22296	338	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	alexandrasgirlytalk where did u get ur tangle teaser btw ILY
22297	339	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Hudabeauty posted this on her Instagram! :D
22298	340	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Ok... I'm no hair stylist but this is pretty awesome. My only concern is that I was once told (by a hair stylist) that it's really bad to put wet hair up in anything tight and let it dry because it will break your hair. She said wet hair is stretched and expanded and when it dries it will take its original shape. If its tied up in a tight pony tail, bun, or anything similar it can cause the hair shaft to weaken and break. I have no idea though. I always sleep with wet hair and flat iron it the next day with heat protectant spray.
22299	341	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Helped a lot ty😘😘
22300	342	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Whaaaat?! I'm so excited to try this. Would it be ok to blow dry the hair a little while it's laid down really tight, before you take it out? I have very thick hair and it actually takes about two days for it to dry completely especially if it's in a bun. Thanks bb!

22309	351	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	"In the Black community we call this ""wrapping"" the hair and have been doing this forever. The difference is we wrap it in one direction and on soaking wet hair w or w/o a setting lotion to straighten the edges. For short hair one can wrap it, put a scarf on, go to bed and it will be dry by morning. For my hair that is almost waist length and very thick and curly, this wouldn't work without sitting under a hooded dryer. It would take all week to airdry lol. I'm impressed that wrapping it in different directions like this didn't lead to a complete matted mess. Good vid, I hope it works out as a heatless option for someone."

22314	356	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWHG4m16rCM	Why do you try to always have a cute face while doing stuff like your makeup or brushing you hair. Nobody ever pays attention but I do it mostly the way you poke out you lips. Be normal. What do you really look like doing those things behind camera.

22326	1	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I’m reading all of these comments about how “natural” she is. And it doesn’t look like she’s had any cosmetic surgery, and obviously doesn’t shave her pits. But people, a woman of 57 HAS GRAY HAIR. So why doesn’t she leave that natural as well?
22327	2	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	This def shows that white people age badly. I’m so thankful for being brown! I’m 30 and I’m always mistaken for looking 23/ rarely 25 😬😬😬🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
22328	3	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	You're a Brooklyn girl and you don't shave your pits?? What's that about? Lol
22329	4	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Hairy pits? Was not expecting it… However, she is stunningly beautiful ❣️
22330	5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Ok natural is one thing but I'm gonna call it.....armpit hair on a woman is gross. When you get older hair tends to get spars so why would you just let that go unless you want to beat your husbands amount of armpit hair....also need to put more attention to hydrating your eye area. Way to many wrinkles because not using the right product if you use any at all. Other then that good to go...LOL
22331	6	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Oh god here we go with all these oRGaNic things, thank god didn’t mention that clean bs
22332	7	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Holy?! She’s 6- what?! That’s amazing! I was eating my soup and when she said that I spit it out! She looks beautiful! I don’t believe in all that Botox stuff so I’m happy to see a woman in Hollywood showing others what normal looks like … especially when u take care of yourself … she looks so good
22333	8	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	she has hairs under arms, look at 6:17
22334	9	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She's literally 60 years old. 57 officially, but wow. This is how you could look when you live your life well and make good choices
22335	10	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She’s very French looking.
22336	11	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	You are doing it wrong at your beauty routine if you don’t pretend doing a vogue video while doing it
22337	12	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I still find it hard to comprehend how Marisa Tomei never had a career that Sandra Bullock and Julia Roberts had? A leading lady with massive appeal
22338	13	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	As a woman that is 57 years old (me), I so adore Marisa Tomei - she's keeping it real as always and is as gorgeous as ever.
22339	14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	If this isn't a real argument for LEAVING YOUR FACE ALONE, I don't know what is. She is radiating beauty, and looks like herself! Will the era of the filler/ botox/ surgery end soon!?
22340	15	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	As I'm getting older, I'm noticing my skin is different so I can't apply make up like I used to. Thanks Vogue and Marisa for sharing a routine that isn't for 20 year skin and very simple and inspiring. I vote for more please! 🙏
22341	16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Laser underarms.....
22342	17	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I have always like Marisa, but you need to shave your armpits! That's just gross when you raised your arms at 1:51 time stamp to expose those armpits.
22343	18	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She is so beautiful at 57yrs old. Very natural. No tons of make up, just perfect, simple and natural. LOVE IT!!
22344	19	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	FINALLY, a woman on one of these that hasn't F'd up her face. She looks sensational.
22345	20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	OMG!! Those hairy underarms!! You think she would've shaved, knowing she was going to were that shirt 👕🤣. You can tell she hasn't been taking care of herself. It shows in her face.
22346	21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Marisa Tomei looks like Marisa Tomei, not a carbon copy of the cosmetic “procedure dujour”!! Beautiful
22347	22	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I lover her and she is so beautiful but can we address this armpit hair?
22348	23	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I’m glad most everyone has noticed that she hasn’t butchered her face with plastic surgery!🙏😘❤️🤗 she look fantastic!
22349	24	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Still an absolute gorgeous woman! No Botox, no filler! Love her!
22350	25	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	There's no way she is 67 😱😱😱 beautiful and fresh she looks! Amazing 🥰
22351	26	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She should at least shave her arm pits. She has beautiful skin
22352	27	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	"*This is what I mean when I say ""natural"": no poses, wrinkles, waxed armpits, or unkempt hair. She has a wonderful figure for her age and a lot of charisma.* 😘😍👍"
22353	28	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Bestie, Aunt May shouldn't have died😭
22354	29	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Marisa, you are so beautiful! But girl shave those armpits please!!
22355	30	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Ummm pit hair? Ewwwww
22356	31	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	petition to have the queen Leighton Meester on Vogue I don't know why they haven't had her on. She played one of the most fashionable and iconic characters of all time she needs to be on here asap.
22357	32	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I love that she says she is grateful for her body, and therefore wants to take care of it. It's definitely a mindset I want to emulate for better health.
22358	33	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She has some of the most beautiful eyes I’ve ever seen, just goes to show gorgeous eyes don’t have to be light/coloured, dark eyes are so sweet and soulful
22359	34	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Love her but gosh I so hate hairy armpits no matter what anyone says but she is so awesome!
22360	35	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I've always liked Marisa Tomei ever since A Different World. I am totally on board with her natural minimal no fuss beauty routine as well! Can't believe she's 57. I have to say that though I enjoy me some neurotic Paulina Porizkova, aka the Crying Lady of Instagram, Tomei is way more chill and cool about aging beauty.
22361	36	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She’s prettier without any makeup, what an awesome skin! Can’t believe her age. No botox, no fillers. A true, genuine beauty
22362	37	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	When she raised her arms and revealed all that hair, I loved her even more. Natural, gorgeous, cool woman! <3
22363	38	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	💔💔
22364	39	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I really appreciate the way Marissa is aging. Natural and healthy looking. Doesn't appear pulled and botoxed..
22365	40	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	aunt may dies in nwh
22366	41	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	"A lot of these women say they ""keep it simple"".... but she REALLY does. And I love that she's keeps it pretty natural, and why shouldn't she? She's a beauty!"
22367	42	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She made the right choice to not mess with her face. Stunning woman.
22368	43	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I just turned 50 and feel like I look 10 years older than her. No idea how she does it but she’s absolutely stunning and respect for showing her true self
22369	44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I've always found her very beautiful. And FIFTY SEVEN? She looks soo much younger than that!
22370	45	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Shave those pits honey!
22371	46	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She appreciates all of her wrinkles while *maintaining a fresh and healthy appearance* .
22372	47	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She has such a natural look with no fillers and Botox and crap. She looks prettier than all those Hollywood women that do crap and surgery, and Botox on there face!
22373	48	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	So nice to see a face that hasn’t been ruined by the edemic bloaty look of filler, or the looong philtrum/upper lip area of a mouth ruined by Botox. She looks beautiful.
22374	49	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Wow…she’s just gotten more and more beautiful as she ages
22375	50	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I can't quite catch that, we don't shave underamr hair anymore or what?! That looks weird in a way. Such a charming woman but this hair underarms looks so frustrating! Or that's a new trend we are facing right now?
22376	51	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	This is what I call natural: no poses, wrinkles, no waxed armpits and messy hair. She looks great for her age, plus that charisma. ❤️
22377	52	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Thank you for actually using someone who is aging gracefully. Sick and tired of plastic people who don’t reflect graceful aging
22378	53	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She was a knockout in her 20’s and is even more gorgeous now!! 🔥🔥🔥 a true queen 👑
22379	54	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Always thought she was so cute 🤗 I love her hair! She doesn't even need any makeup either. Love that she is a natural beauty and doesn't shave under her arms. Most people cringe when they see a woman with arm pit hair. I started menopause when I was around 46 and my arm pit hair is gone, so i think it's amazing she is 57 and has hair. She looks so healthy.
22380	55	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	so refreshing to see armpit hair, which we all have but have to pretend we don't.
22381	56	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Even her hairy armpits are somehow adorable! She's so down to Earth, and REAL. A breathe of fresh air
22382	57	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	No Botox, no fillers, underarm hair! Refreshing, real and rare to see not like those fake celebrities that misrepresent themselves and pretend they’re like that without “help”
22383	58	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Anyone else love her eyes? They’re so big dark and pretty
22384	59	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She looks her age and gorgeous. No platypus lips or plate Botox forehead. Thank you Marisa!
22385	60	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She looks so much better and natural by not having surgeries
22386	61	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	✨☺️☺️☺️ Auntie May 🥰🥰🥰✨
22387	62	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	HOW IS THERE ONLY ONE COMMENT ON THE ARMPIT HAIR . I went through the comments just for that 😱🤮🤢
22388	63	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She’s 57!? she’s so beautiful as always. Love her.
22389	64	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	she embraces all the wrinkles and still looks so youthful and fresh.
22390	65	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	George Costanza got it right on having a crush on Marisa Tomei... she's a timeless beauty
22391	66	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She looks great, but I was shocked when I saw her hairy armpits.😬
22392	67	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Love Marisa Tomei. She's SO gorgeous and imagining she's a bestie with Lisa Bonet! OMG. By the way can we have Zendaya and Miyavi Ishihara next? 🎸🔥🔥🔥
22393	68	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	😭 why pits so hairy.....🤮....made my head hurt. Love Marisa tho....😭😭
22394	69	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	She is so beautiful and real but whats with the forest under her arms? Ew
22395	70	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I met her at the New York Film Festival two years ago and she had no makeup on and was truly so stunning. Always loved her as an actress. Love that she's so simple with her routine. ❤️
22396	71	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	I HAVE TO CONFESS sometimes when i'm doing my makeup/skincare i pretend i'm doing one of these videos and i talk to an imaginary camera like i'm some famous celeb ok i said it bye edit: omg i'm so glad i'm not the only one lol thanks for the likes
22397	72	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	Can we just appreciate the celebrities who spend their time to show us how to put on makeup? Like they are so nice 😁
22398	73	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	First thing I noticed is she doesn’t shave underarms
22399	74	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCEgHmK4mg	SHE IS A NATURAL BEAUTY. GORGEOUS
