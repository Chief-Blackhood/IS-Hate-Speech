https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79ogy1YNXtc	Listening to our brother, I am reminded of the fear I held from childhood about the hellfire. Reminds me of a dream all those years ago. I was a child sleeping when a knock outside my window. I opened the window and looked down. There in the dark was a river of fire and a small, cute boat resting against the walls and in the boat was the devil. Eventhough his body was red and he had a long red tail and horns upon his head, yet he was extremely handsome and had playfulness in his eyes. His mood was good and when he looked up seeing me looking at him he raised his hand beckoning me join him in his boat and go with him. I remember looking at him and refusing his hand, refusing the journey he offered. * lol. The dream was not scary and a dream of a child. It was after my conversion to Islam that the memory of this dream came back. Subhannallah. Hopefully it is ok i shared my dream.

I've experienced it a lot, i write about it accurately. mine were induced by marijuana and a recent PTSD. writing about it made me a different man, i understand myself more every day and it helped me process my past and come out as a more definitive being, it is a spiritual experience that made me closer to the universe and the concept of God.

Now it's almost 2022, and my anxiety is gone! Of course, I might get a little more nervous about something than other people will, but I'm still young, so there was enough time to do something about it. I had a total of only two panic attacks during that time, and both times I was extremely scared of dying. I thought I was going to die and those thoughts wouldn't leave my mind. So I started to take care of myself. Every time I looked in the mirror I'd think nice things about myself and what I saw in the reflection. I remember when the attacks happened, I'd always think ""This too, shall pass"" and start to feel a little better. I think both times my attacks happened it was because of a lack of sleep. The first time it happened I had no idea what was going on so I locked myself in the bathroom and texted my friend about what was happening, and he comforted me through it. The second time it was a smaller attack and wasn't as scary because I knew what to do and knew what was going on this time, but either way it's still a fright. My attacks didn't last the whole day, only for a few minutes or a little longer, but I would still be a bit shaken up for the rest of the day. You all are so strong, and I believe in you. I made it, so I have no doubt that you all will too. I'm forever grateful to everyone who helped me with my anxiety, so I want to help people with theirs in return.

I lost 14 pounds within 3- 4weeks... I'd cry almost every night because I felt weak and tired of it all but as many people struggling with mental health, I was scared of going to therapy and getting help. One night at 1am I told my parents that I'm ready to see a professional and that is the best decision I have ever made to this day. It only took one session with someone who understood me. My appetite started improving and slowly but surely I was starting to stress less about my panic attacks. I haven't had one since, so it's been 4 years now. To anyone who's going through this: tell yourself you're ok and mean it! You are going to be fine. It will pass trust me! This is how I got out of a very dark place in my life and it took me months but once you start thinking optimistically and clearing your head of such bad thoughts, the attacks will leave once and for all!

Edit 3: The hour is over, so now I'm starting to put the bobby pins in place. Edit 4: I put all the bobby pins in and look stupid. Doubting this tutorial now... (next update will be in the morning) Edit 5: It didn't work. My hair just turned out curly like it was before. This was a very good idea, and I might try it again soon! :) Okay so it is about 2 months later (1/17/19) and im willing to try again. - i have already washed and combed my hair and i am now waiting for the hour to finish.
