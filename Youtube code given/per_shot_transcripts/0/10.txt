more hands-on
instead of trusting that his kids will
be responsible eventually
we got into a rhythm i learned how to
balance
everything and started making beautiful
music

eventually he snaps i've been working so
hard
keeping everything together baby and i
can't even get the damn cookies that i
want
sweetheart they they look the same they
are not the same
the episode ends with a good reminder
from bo to be easy on ourselves
and each other look we're used to living
