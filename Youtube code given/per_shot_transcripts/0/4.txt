by healthcare workers
from the initial lack of tests and ppe i
need ekg leads
what do you mean to watching patients
die alone without family by their side
the fourth patient i've lost today
and they're all dying alone grey's
anatomy also depicted the racism
experienced by asian americans due to
the virus originating in china
i don't want a chinese doctor oh
okay then you're going to want to follow
this green line to the parking lot put
your roots off back in your car and hope
you don't go into anaphylectic shock
